"Can't beat the price and can't beat the quality of a Dell. I bought this for my dad because he needed for non-complicated things, and its the best to get for seniors I believe. Fast, reliable, won't break down, highly recommend!!"
"I love it. Great size, easy to operate, value can't be beat."
"Battery level Fe isn't great"
"The screen became detached and broken the 13th month after purchasing it, which of course was 1 month after the 1-year warranty expired.  It cost me $164 for a local computer repair shop to get it working again.  The technician explained that Dell is now holding the screen in place to its frame with ""2-sided tape rather than with metal screws"" as once was standard.  What a cheap way for reputable Dell to make its laptops!  To would-be buyers, I recommend purchasing a two year warranty, which simply shouldn't be necessary on this otherwise fast, handy touchscreen laptop.  Also, open the screen from the middle, not from either end of the screen so as not to put pressure on the frame and detach it from that worthless 2-sided tape!The second one I ordered lasted a few days before the screen went black!  The seller took over a week to refund my payment."
"Laptop is perfect."
"Came well wrapped and packaged.. battery life is great. Was hesitant but glad I made d purchase"
"Heavy, and I don’t like the keyboard. Number pad should not be a part of the keyboard.  Price dropped by 20% right after I bought it."
"It is a different format but once you get accustom to the computer it works well. It is faster, color clearer."
"I love this computer. The delivery was very fast and the packaging was great. It took just a few minutes to set everything up. This is the computer that I used every single day for my work from home, and for some occasional streaming of shows and movies. I love it. The display is also just the right size for my home office."
"Great product, ideal for home and great power."
"I am not a computer geek. So I had to Google instructions on how to turn it on and off.  I'm a senior citizen and my last computer (10 years old) had complete diagrams. Once I figured it out, it is fine"
"So far the computer is working fine.  However, out of the box there was no keyboard dongle so I connect the wireless keyboard.  The only option is to return the whole computer which is unacceptable.  All I need is the dongle."
"Works fast,screen bigger"
"It comes up very quickly."
"I love my new Dell computer. After I got it set up it is working great, love the screen size. I’m an older person and not tech savvy but I did ok with it. They could give you better information on setting it up."
"I was on a waiting list for a 'Renewed Premium'. Seemed to be a long waiting list. I finally gave up and went with a 'Renewed' advertised in excellent condition. Given Amazon's generous return policy, returning it would have been easy if there had been issues. I probably wouldn't have tried this with an online retailer other than Amazon and Apple.The supplier was TECHMINT, Amazon was only the purchase portal. There seems to be a number of 'Amazon-qualified suppliers' involved. To know who you're buying from, the 'ships from/sold by' info. is on the right side of the product page. There may also be differences in packaging and accessories. Best to read through the advertising to know exactly what you're buying. Or contact the supplier before purchasing. Given that Amazon backs these purchases, not a concern.It arrived without scratches, dings, or apparent wear. Looks like new. That said, those buying a 'Renewed' phone should expect varying degrees of condition within the parameters of Amazon's advertising. I'd suggest buying a 'Renewed Premium' for your best chance of a like-new phone. I probably got lucky with a 'Renewed'.It shipped in *very* well designed and protective box designed for phones. Not likely to be damaged in transit short of extremely heavy crush damage. If you plan on shipping your phone or storing a back-up, I'd suggest keeping it. The box has spacers to accommodate different sizes. Kudos to the packaging engineers. Well done.It was delivered with 100% battery health which almost certainly means that the phone was opened up and the battery replaced. The likelihood of a 'renewed' 13 Mini arriving with battery health at 100% is slim to none. I assume that they did this because the phone was traded in with ≤ 80% battery health. The advertising states that the phone will arrive with battery health of ≥ 80%.I ran two diagnostics to check functions. In both cases, no issues. One of the diagnostics is built into iOS. You'll need iOS 17 or later and not a beta release. Search for 'built in iPhone diagnostic' for instructions. There's another which makes doing this quite a bit easier. From the Apple app store search for 'Phone Doctor Plus'. It leans more towards being a function check vs a more sophisticated diagnostic but great for making sure everything works. There's a free and paid version. There are others but these are the only two I've tried.The advertising stated that an MFi certified charging/data cable ships with the phone. Mine shipped with a 3ft cloth jacketed USB C to Lightning charging cable. No branding or print on the cable, no included documentation, no packaging. It appears similar to what you sometimes see without packaging and hanging from peg racks in convenience stores.I have no reason to believe that the provided cable isn't MFi certified and from a reliable manufacturer but without more information, I'd suggest using an Apple product or something from a reliable aftermarket supplier such as Anker or Belkin. Look for 'MFi certified' especially if you want fast charging capability. There are reasons USB C cables can be pricey, especially those designed for high power delivery. Better safe than sorry.Mine shipped without a charger. I checked the interior packaging to be sure. I'd say the same about a charger as I did about the cable - MFi certified and from a reputable manufacturer - Apple, Anker, Belkin, etc. For the 13 Mini, Apple recommends a minimum of a 20 watt charger for optimal/fast charging . Apple's is about 20 dollars. It's also what Apple recommends for powering *the original* MagSafe accessory. The updated version of the MagSafe charger supports faster charging and according to Apple, a minimum of a 30 watt charger for optimal performance.Some suppliers advertise that a sim card removal tool is included. Mine didn't. If yours shipped with a sim card (mine did not), I'd suggest reading through the pros and cons of SIM vs eSIM. If eSIM meets your needs, I'd recommend removing the SIM and switching to eSIM. Switching to eSIM can be done in your phone's settings. No expertise or hardware required. Although unlikely if buying from an 'Amazon-qualified supplier' (I assume), SIM cards can be compromised. If you need a SIM card, best to get one from your carrier instead of a mystery SIM.You'll need a case. Without, it's not a matter of if you'll drop it but when. This is my second mini, the first an iPhone 12 Mini. Slippery and with a smaller form factor than other iPhones, very easy lose grip especially if you have large hands. Further, without a case the camera lenses and screen make contact with whatever surface you place them on.The Apple leather case has been my go-to for the last 3-4 iPhones. Very well designed, doesn't add significant bulk, no sharp edges and it slips into and out of a pocket easily. The drop protection has proven to be excellent. Great case for all but extreme circumstances. They're relatively pricey so If you're looking to save, there are often Amazon customer returns available at steeply discounted prices.The iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini cases are not interchangeable. I tried. The camera lens housings are different. The 12 mini case will not fit the 13 mini. The 13 mini case will fit the 12 mini but there will be a gap on the right side of the lens housing.Not to overstate it but If you're considering both the 12 mini and 13 mini, battery life may be problematic for heavy users. True of all phones but more so for a Mini. If you have a full size phone with a larger battery at ≥ 90% battery health (guesstimate) and often find yourself scrambling to find a charger, the Mini may not be for you.If you're on the move a lot without convenient charging options, a small MagSafe power bank (≤ 5000mAh) will bring some peace of mind and a lot of convenience. Great when traveling. Definitely stick with time tested manufacturers. Anker and Belkin sell a wide variety. Note that the TSA only allows powerbanks in carry-ons.Apple discontinued it's iPhone powerbanks (Magsafe Battery Pack). As of this writing, you can still find them new from third party sources such as Walmart online. Never buy used. There are confirmed and very convincing counterfeits out there so I'd be cautious about which supplier you choose.If you're looking at both the 12 and 13 Minis, the 13 Mini uses an A15 processor which is somewhat more energy efficient and slightly faster. It also has a ~10% larger battery. There are quite a few other differences including an upgraded camera.In day to day use, I found the differences to be almost unnoticeable. Having a larger battery is nice but rarely something that makes a difference given my usage habits. Those that push their phones harder will probably appreciate the extra power.Definitely worth reading comparison reviews. Some of the updates will be important for some, less so for others. Search for ""iPhone 13 mini vs iPhone 12 mini"". If you read only one, Laptopmag.com did a good real-world comparison.Long term, the 13 Mini will receive system/feature updates from Apple for about a year longer. This may be the most value added difference.Happy customer. I'm fully committed to the Mini form factor/dimensions. I carry it all day in a front or back pocket and barely know it's there. Having a phone with more screen, battery and features is nice but after the novelty wears off, having a phone that disappears into a pocket is more important for some of us. When I need to replace it, perhaps Mini's will be back in the menu from Apple. Hope so."
"TLDR: First one I got was HORRENDOUS, but seller communication was exceptional, quick, no hassle, and replacement was awesome!This is a review for the seller 'Hybrid IT', not the actual iPhone 13 mini. There are plenty of those already.I bought an 'acceptable condition' 13 mini, as I don't mind scratches and dents if it'll save a few hundred bucks. I bought from 'Hybrid IT' because they had like 99% positive ratings and I know refurbished can be hit and miss. And they had prime shipping.The one they sent was TERRIBLE. The screen was a fake LCD knockoff, the battery health was at 77%, and it was full of scratches on the screen. Far below my already low expectations.I messaged them and they offered me these options:1) replacement,2) return for full refund, or3) to refund the cost of replacing the battery at apple (which is like a third of the cost of the phone itself)They answer surprisingly quickly every time. Literally within a few minutes during the day and within a few hours at night. ____ing impressive! I needed a phone quick so we decided the best option was to buy another one (also 'acceptable', same price), and return the old one for a refund, and they would make sure to send a better one the second time.It definitely exceeded my expectations. Almost perfect condition, 98% battery, no scratches basically. I think it was a fair outcome/settlement for wasting my time with an insultingly bad one the first time. I would've been fine with 'acceptable' condition but the first one I got was not even up to par with Amazon's standards.I'm really happy with the second one and how they handle customer service. Thanks Hybrid IT!!! Oh, and this isn't a fake review! A happy customer, crazy right???"
"I bought a 13 mini in Refurbished - Excellent condition. When I received it I wasn’t all that impressed with the packaging. Simple cardboard box and surprisingly, not much protective material for the phone itself. It was simply put into a plastic sleeve and thrown in the box. It did come with a charging cube and cable. Anyways, the phone itself was in pretty good condition. Perfect screen. The back of the phone was also pretty perfect minus a few scratches. The perimeter of the phone however had some damage but again, nothing awful. My issue begins when I try to switch my SIM card from my old phone to this new phone. Turns out the phone I got was originally bought in China which wouldn’t be a big deal but my phone carrier is having connectivity issues. It’s completely fine on WiFi but I’m not always connected to WiFi. Either way I decided to test it out and I am indeed having connectivity issues. So, unfortunately, I will be returning this phone for that reason. I bought from the seller Woot and have decided to try buying a phone from them again once my refund is processed so I will update once I receive the newly ordered phone.— update —So I opted to instead buy from Amazon directly. I didn’t want to risk getting another foreign phone and I went with the right option. Came in great condition. There is a small scratch on the screen itself (even though I bought in “excellent” condition, but it’s seriously not even noticeable unless im actively looking for it). Battery health is at 89% which is great. The back of the phone is perfect. Was a bit dirty when I first got it but nothing a little alcohol and qtips won’t help. So far it’s working great, no issues at all. The switch from my old phone was super easy. It came in a sort of vacuum sealed plastic instead of just thrown in the box. It did only come with a charging cable though, no block. If that matters. Overall, if the option is available I would go with buying from Amazon directly instead of a third party seller to avoid any issues."
"Phone works great but body was scratched a bit"
"The renewed Apple iPhone 13 Pro with 128GB in Gold is a remarkable find for those seeking top-notch performance and style at a great price. Upon arrival, the phone was in pristine condition, functioning perfectly and showcasing the high standards of Apple’s refurbishment process. The 128GB of storage offers plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos, while the stunning Gold finish adds a touch of luxury to the phone's sleek design. Performance is stellar, with the iPhone 13 Pro’s powerful processor and advanced features delivering a smooth and responsive experience. The camera system captures photos and videos with exceptional clarity and detail. Overall, this renewed iPhone 13 Pro provides exceptional value and elegance, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy premium features without the premium price"
"Very nice phone with like 3 very very minor scratches that you can only see if you look really close up. No dents at all. That’s fine tho since it was acceptable condition. Every works well.The battery life was 86% but that’s fine seeing that the price was $200 less than others. Face ID, camera speakers and microphone works. Phone came clean and with type c lighting charger but no charging block.  MCE SALES was the seller I highly recommend!!"
"I just got my new phone today, and i’m pretty pleased with it. It works really well, the only cons are that the back has a few splotches on it that won’t come off, and the maximum battery capacity is at 80%, and for excellent quality i expected more. But otherwise, it’s a good quality phone."
"I could not be happier wit the device sent. The iphone came in pristine condition, no visible marks and with 100% battery, which I assume was changed and if so, glad the change was made. Everything is functional and I'm extremely satisfied with the seller on this transaction. Great purchase!"
"Came in good condition. There were minor signs of use which were removed with a damp cloth. I also noticed a small scratch on the screen if you look at a certain angle, battery condition was 92%. I have been using the phone for over two months now everything is great. Recommended"
"I purchased this phone as an upgrade for myself as I desperately needed it, I saw mixed reviews on battery life but overall the conditions of the phones seemed to be good. When mine arrived I was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (Trust me I looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. I later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. The phone I got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the MSRP of this phone when it originally released, I was extremely happy. There were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: The packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: The setup process for the phone, I struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and I would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my Apple ID or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually I came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what I did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. One side note: I don’t believe this was a fault of the seller I think this was an Apple issue! After all, I got a brand new iPhone 13 Pro and I am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase"
"I’ve bought refurbished phones before and not had an issue, but this was my first time using Amazon Renewed. The first phone came and had 100% battery which I was happy about, but there was a crack in the lower left corner. Disappointing, but I returned it and bought another from Amazon Renewed. The second phone had 85% battery health, which is still good, and it works perfectly.The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is the way they dragged their feet giving me my refund. I returned it, it showed it arrived at their facility on January 12, and they kept pushing out my refund date which was aggravating because now I had two phones on my credit card bill. I contacted them on Jan 28 and they told me not to worry, I’d have my refund by February 17. I said absolutely not, they had better refund me by the end of the month, or I was going to dispute the charge. The guy chatting with me reassured me I’d get my money by February 17 and I went in circles with him on this, with us both stating the same thing over again. I ended it by telling him to tell his supervisor (who he had contacted to find out about the refund), that if I wasn’t refunded by Jan 31, I would be disputing it. I had the refund by the next day.So that was a pain and started to make me feel like it was a scam. It all turned out well, but they did not make the process easy. Supposedly they have to have received it AND processed the return for me to be refunded, but it was a ridiculous amount of time and should have been done long before.That being said, I’m happily typing this review from the second phone I bought from them and it’s in great condition."
"Was a little weary of buying a phone online off Amazon, but I definitely wasn’t disappointed!Couldn’t find anything close to the low cost. I paid for this top quality phone, which was exactly as described and works perfectly better battery life than I expected. Better quality than I expected. Absolutely perfect couldn’t ask for anything better!"
"I’m happy with the order there was no damageP working just fine and perfect"
"Battery was at 79%, provided charger is a slow charger but new apple devices don’t even have that so no complaints. The phone itself was in mint condition, looked new to me in a non Apple package."
"I honestly can’t say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!"
"I have been using the phone for a few days now and have been very pleased.Good batter life, came with screen protector already installed, no cosmetic damage, charges great and haven’t noticed any heat issues or battery problems.When I use the camera, the flash on the back seems to cause a weird fog effect- though this may just be due to my phone case choice :)Touch screen works perfectly, connected without issue to my unlocked phone carrier.The packaging was good and box arrived without damage. Came with the phone itself- with a tempered glass screen protector installed, and a charging cord (no block).**November 27th; still working great so far! Still in great condition, no glitching, no issues. The battery does drain quickly if I am using the phone for games or watching videos; however, this is perfectly normal for any phone. Data takes energy :). This is a GREAT option for someone with a low budget, and isn’t picky about a USED item not being brand new out of the box (be realistic)."
"okay, it came In a weird packaging so I was suspicious it was absolutely wonderfully packed tho. it came in a small box, iphone in bubble wrap and then a lighting cable to charge in a plastic bag. the screen had no scratches, the back was wonderfully brand new, I chose yellow . It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit ."
"I recently purchased the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed, and overall, I’m quite satisfied with my purchase. Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product."
"Bought as a up grade to my wife’s phonePhone is in really good condition with good battery lifeI would definitely buy again if the need arose"
"So far I have no complaints! Physically the phone is pristine ,not a mark.It charged 100%. It set up just fine, all the apps loaded and software fully updated. I didn’t expect perfection, but, so far, I’m pretty close!"
"Phone looks brand new .This supplier provides phone with 100 percent battery life so worth of moneySo far phone is working good.Phone came with charger. No scratches."
"This phone looks are performs like a new phone; Not a scratch, mark, or blemish to be found."
"Exactly as described and pictured, no hassle transaction! Fast shipping, well packaged! Worked well never had any issues, do not use anymore but did for about 2 years and still have as a back up! Would buy again!"
"I purchased the unlocked iPhone XR 64GB unlocked renewed premium. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The outside of the phone is flawless, it looks brand new. The battery is 96% of original capacity and it operates without issue. Only problem was a shipping delay, but the seller promptly refunded the extra I paid for expedited shipping. Overall a great experience and great seller. I highly recommend."
"The phone is perfect!!! Perfect condition. Smooth as butta!! Perfect for my holidays lol. For sure!!! Thank you and have a happy holidays!!!!"
"I have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now. Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money."
"Used as a business phone, good camera, good price for money, battery life healthy, fast charging"
"Basically like a brand new phone. Mine came without any scratches, dents, or anything like that. Battery is amazing, totally worth the money, and zero lag. I’ve dropped it plenty of times and its fine :)."
"The exterior is in perfect condition and so far it’s operating like my previous one iPhone XR. I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen."
"This is my first iphone. I've always had an Android phone. I am some impressed with this phone. Battery holds a good charge. 90% efficacy in the health department. It arrived undamaged and looked super clean. Just like a new phone would. I love it!"
"The phone was in perfect condition. The battery life is at 90%. I’m very happy with our choice of saving a few dollars by getting these phones or other options."
"Received with 88% battery life, which is very good. Little to no scratches on the glass and frame. Everything works. This iphone 11 pro even through a couple years old is way faster and zero freeze or lag. Stick with iOS.Returned a brand new flagship android phone because of google maps lags and everything is unoptimized."

Phone Works Great 100% Maximum Battery Capacity Took 2 Days To Come In … Thanks Very Much"
"The iPhone 11 Pro is nice. Everything works. EXCEPT, neither volume button work on the side. Or my button on the side to put the phone on silent doesn’t work either!! And when my phone is on the Lock Screen, I can’t slide my camera open.And I’m having battery problems. It charges super fast. But if I don’t put it on low battery mode, my phone will jump from 90% to 10% in a matter of a few minutes. And my phone dies on 7% everytime. Just aggravating when this was supposed to be a phone that went through all the “test”. Apparently not because it would’ve failed these test."

Bought this phone as a gift for someone. It works well, has all the necessary features and came in pretty good condition, no scratches or cracks. Only thing the battery percentage came at 95%"
"Ships fast, phone look and operates like new!I would buy from them again!!!Great service thank you!!!"
"Perfect condition. Exactly as advertised."
"Brought for a friend she loves it over her original 8 promax"
"Don't understand why people buy new, Fantastic Apple 11, $400 ApproximatelyNot a scratch, and Battery 100%thought would have to replace the batteryFantastic, love it, was Samsung for over 30 YearsNot any more"
"After 12 years of faithful service, the decision was made to retire our Sony KDL-46HX850( 46-inch 1080p/240Hz) TV.Being one of the early ""Smart"" TV's on the market, it's limitations over the years became greater and greater, despite providing one of the best quality picture experiences ever, this includes, but is not limited to;Apps - It came with only a handful of Apps installed, like YouTube, Internet Browsing, and Netflix. Sadly this particular TV does not allow you to download or add additional ones. Nor have said Apps updated for at least 5 years. Netflix opens and works once in a while, usually requiring multiple restarts to load.Soundbar Issues - In late 2020 we added a 7.1 Nakamichi soundbar to our setup, after our previous Vizio 5.1 system we bought shortly after the TV died. However changing channels too quickly caused the station to lose sound, requiring a complete restart of the TV and Soundbar to allow sound to flow from the TV HDMI output.Tried using Roku, but again, it never worked properly on this particular TV. It was tested however in two different Samsung models; the 2014 UN65H7150 65-Inch 1080p 240Hz, and a 2019 QN82Q90RAFXZA 82-inch 4K 120Hz and it worked fine on those two TVs.So lets' get into the actual review for this model listed in the headline....PROS:First Impressions: Lightweight; weighs less than my 46-inch, although it doesn't have the gorilla glass my old one had. Thinner by about 3-5mm overall.Remote; approx half the size of my 2019 Samsung model with dramatic improvements - C type rechargeable port versus requiring regular batteries, and even has a photo-electric eye to allow sunlight recharging system on the back of the remote. Disney+ and Amazon Prime single app buttons added.Picture Quality; outstanding for obvious reasons; 1080p vs 4K; meaning twice as many lines of resolution. HDR which means greater color space, allowing for a wider range of colors to be displayed. Despite being only half of the frequency response of my previous set (120Hz vs 240Hz), I wanted to be sure this would not be a ""noticeable"" issue, so I tested this thoroughly out using movies from my personal collection that had heavy/intense action sequences, no ghosting or pixelation was detected.Sound Quality; Have never used just the standard included back-facing speakers, so I cannot comment, always have used Soundbars.Set-Up; Again this is such a breeze now compared to just a few short years ago, logging into Apps with QR codes on your phones versus typing everything out. From the time I had the unit on the wall and first powered up, until all software updates and Apps were added and logged into was less than 30 minutes. Added 6 different Apps that are used on daily basis in our household.This is now the 2nd Samsung Q90 model I've purchased in the last 4 years, and I believe they are worth every single penny. But to be fair.....I must point out the negatives.CONS:Viewing Distance - to gain the full 4K experience at my current TV size (50"") I need to be no further than 6ft away, which means I need to be sitting towards the middle/end of my bed. Whereas with my old unit, thew viewing distance was nearly double, meaning I could be lying down normally and not notice a drop in picture quality.4K vs 1080p; when watching standard definition programming (480p), my old 1080p TV wins hands down, the additional upscaling done by 4K TV's makes to my eyes, the picture less enjoyable. It's just something I've gotten used to over the years. It stuck out heavily when I bought my first 4K, watching cable channels broadcasting in 480p resolution. Since most shows/movies cable and streaming services are at least HD quality, it still upscales, where again watching on a 1080p gave a better experience in my opinion.Sound; Let's be honest, all HDTV's have terrible or barely passing audio, since they are backward facing. You are better off buying an inexpensive forward facing soundbar versus using the included speakers only. If you can afford it (and have the space), buying a 5.1 or 7.1 soundbar system is the way to go.All three of my household TV's are Samsung models, although I have had quite a few Sony models in the past, reviews between brands when I am shopping for a replacement have been pushing me steadily towards Samsung.Two terrible experiences have permanently soured me ever buying LG ever again."
"From our title, you may have caught on we kind of like this TV. Honestly, it’s the nicest TV we own, and we have a few between our home and our lake house. I think the price when bought on sale around the holidays is a great price proposition for excellent picture quality, features and size and the cost. Since we have a couple other Samsung TV’s, we were used to the basic remote and smart features. But this QN90C is so much faster, responsive and feature rich, that it is a clear winner. We have been pleased with our Q70B 65” TV at our cottage that we got 2 years ago, but this QN90C we got for home this past Christmas is so much better.We liked it so much that when our oldest adult son was also looking for a new TV around the holidays, we highly recommended this one. He ended up buying one too on sale and loves it. We mainly stream and watch YouTube TV. He mainly games. For both households, it’s a great option.Great picture quality! 4K as well as upscaling 1080p is excellent. When something is in 4K, it’s perfect! Has so many features. The smart-calibration system you can do with your phone is very worthwhile in dialing it in easily. It integrated very nicely with our in wall 5.2 speaker system and receiver via an optician cable. I could just go on and on about all the different features, as they are work as advertised.And although many people complain about the Tizen smart styles, we don’t mind it. Like others, I think I prefer the layout of it on our 2 year older Q70 vs the newer layout on this 2023 QN90. That is totally a layout preference on our part. That said, the range of free stations if you will, and the versatility of the layout are very nice. And, once you get used to the layout, its works well.Frankly the only drawback is that two years ago when we had to replace our cottage TV, I went with the Q70. I thought that was nice until I got this QN90, and now I wish I had spent a little more back in 2020 to get a Q90 back then at the other place. That said, I would wait for holiday sale pricing. The discount is worth waiting for."
"I’m absolutely obsessed with this TV! It’s movie time all of the time- even in my bright living room. I had professional installation and a slim mount. I love that I can see the tv from anywhere in my open floor plan. I bought another big brand previously and returned it. The sound on this tv is unmatchable. No need to get a sound system. It’s a beautiful tv and I’m so happy!"
"Great picture and I love this TV! Easy to use and great quality!"
"I just moved to a new city and in setting up my new place to live, I decided that I was going to indulge myself and set up a serious home theatre. This screen is, obviously the centerpiece.I did a lot of research and it felt like this QLED television would hit the right balance of quality, size and price and it most definitely has. It's a gorgeous screen and the set up has it about 12 feet from my sofa so it literally feels cinematic! One thing I would suggest is that, if you're wanting to set it up for hardcore movie watching, dig through the settings and set picture mode to ""Filmmaker Mode"". It's stunning!I opted not to get a cable TV package here because I was planning on doing everything via streaming, so far, so good. My set up is an AppleTV 4K to handle all of the streaming with a stereo pair of Dolby Atmos capable HomePod 2 speakers which work perfectly for the room size.Now as to why I say ""almost perfect"" in the headline: What I really wanted (and, sadly, I'll never be able to get) is not a ""smart TV"". Since I want to be able to handle the streaming through an external device and have the sound running through external speakers, what I wish I could've bought was a stripped down version of this panel with no speakers and no ""smart"" features. Basically a very very high end large monitor. The TV is enabled with Alexa (which I don't use) and its own App Store (which I also don't use) and some decent speakers (which have never been used since I set up the system). I really wish TV manufacturers would make simple, high quality stripped down  televisions with advanced picture settings but none of the rest of it.Now I'm going to go watch something 4K and loud!"
"Beautiful cris and clear pictures with various picture modes.  Color is excellent.  Whoever was involved with design of remote control should be fired.  It’s solar powered and solar battery on back so requires turning remote facedown and charging it in light. No indicator when power low.  Just stops suddenly and requires charging, so unable to even turn off what watching.  Smart features not intuitive and can be confusing.  Requires extensive setup. Still, was buying for picture quality and not disappointed.  Bought a 43” Q60A for bedroom and liked the picture but the 65’ Q70A is superior in picture quality.  A bit pricey, but worth it for picture quality compared to less expensive models I’ve tried.  Overall, a very nice TV ."
"This television is stunning.  The picture makes me want to watch something on TV.I bought the 75 inch version and it fit my oddly shaped living room perfectly.  It's like it belonged there the entire time.When I had received the TV, it was delivered right into my living room and the delivery person made sure that I was happy with what I had received before leaving.  I then connected it to the Internet and applied some updates before setting it up on its wall mount.  I can't say enough nice things about this TV.While I would have preferred having a few more buttons on the controller, using the software and voice control options aren't bad.  As I have another older Samsung TV, I was pleased to see that the old controller works perfectly on the new TV.  That was just a nice perk."
"I did my research and read up tv reviews before I decided on this sammy instead of sony. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. The TV arrived nicely packaged. Upon cutting open the box, I noticed the protecting film was missing from the screen, but did not find any visible defects. Turned it on and went through the set up process (is it just me? why the heck do I have to set up an online account in order to use my TV??!!) other than account thing, the set up was relatively smooth. It picked up my xfinity tv box and lg sound bar, and my non-brand android tv box too after some tweaking. I did not like the picture out of the box, had to adjust the color to my taste. Everything looks good except the viewing angle. I read the review saying that it is not that good(7 out of 10) but it is REALLY not good. Color is so washed out from like 40 degree angle. I would only give it maybe 5 or 6 because my older vizio tv has better viewing angle than this thing. The remote works surprisingly well. After some digging, I am able to use it to control the tv, sound bar and the android tv box, works better than my Logitech remote."
"I always wanted a big television and this is it. I had it delivered and installed and have absolutely no regrets. I just binge watched my favorite series and loved the huge display. It’s like being right there in the scene. I don’t even have to wear my every day glasses to watch this thing! The super bowl was so much more fun watching it on this monster display. It’s got a ton of apps and functions and it walks you through every setup step by step. The coolest thing is the solar powered remote! I don’t know why nobody thought of that before. The installer was so puzzled by it., he kept looking for the batteries until I grabbed the remote. When I saw the solar panel on the back we both were amazed. No more batteries!I can’t say enough good things about this television. This is by far my best online purchase ever!"
"Awesome product with great features."
"This 50"" Neo QLED TV has fantastic picture quality.Definitely worth the price.I have had many Samsung TVs and Monitors.  On all of these, there is not one single dead or stuck pixel.So screen quality is excellent."
"Greetings,Have not turned it on.  Delivery was great.  I went through the initial setting.  Picture looks Great.  Easy setup.  Have went thru lots of TV's since 1986.Hoping this will be the best.Chief"
"This has been a horrible experience, wish I could rate the product but after botched delivery attempts without messaging, not delivered when promised and when finally arrives I had to chase the FedEx guy for a block because even though I answered the vestibule-phone he left before I got down to the lobby of my apartment building. So instead of getting on 4/26 as originally promised, I finally got it on 4/30 and took the time to set it up but any app I choose gets ""Smart Hub is being updated."" message. So have been on the phone, in text message and in online Samsung support chat for 3 hours this morning while they all have me go through the exact same troubleshooting steps repeatedly that do nothing to resolve it. I get a Samsung rep on the phone who remotes-in and does all the checking and troubleshooting steps himself on my screen, reboots, etc. but problem is still not resolved, I still can't use any apps. So his solution is to have a service rep come out but the earliest is 5/6 which means I have no functional tv for the next 5 days after spending $2k+, waiting 4 days, spending hours setting up and several more hours on the phone with Samsung reps who could not get the apps to work. I actually do use my tv for cardio workouts which is necessary for my health but now have to wait 5 days just to use this brand new tv. this whole situation STINKS."
"Beautifully sharp picture with vibrant color and depth!"
"Like the picture right out of the box and easy setup."
"I replaced a 3 year old Samsung with this unit. The depth, color and clarity are so much better then the previous model. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a top notch 85 inch"
"We purchased a Samsung Neo Qled in 2021.  It is a wonderful TV and the user menu is great.  We came back for this new Samsung in a larger size.  The new one has a good picture.  However, the user menu has changed for the worse.  All kinds of ads which are much bigger than the apps you are using.  In addition, we love the ""Picture Off"" option to enjoy the audio only.  This works with all the apps except Youtube TV.  (This works flawlessly on our older TV set with Youtube TV.)  Also, some apps will not load at all like SiriusXM.  I was on the phone with Samsung Support for hours and hours.  Reset to Factory, soft resets, hard resets, uninstalling apps, etc. and nothing fixed it.  Please Samsung, roll back the updates to match the 2021 TV sets.  We are now debating whether to send this back or deciding it's just not worth the trouble to do so and be stuck with it.Update:  After talking to YouTube TV Support and a couple of other apps, we find these apps are not compatible with the options on the new Samsung TV.  We have decided to keep the TV and hope Samsung will listen to our request to fix these problems."
"This TV definitely has Glare & Reflections.The Picture is OK with a totally dark room with no windows.Also the Display mode for Film maker seems to be the best.The other options make TV programs too sharp & looks really phony,My old 2005 Phillips TV had a great picture but quit working.. as a really expensive replacement I was really hoping for way better."
"Was delivered in a little over a week, which was longer than I wanted... But it was a good price so I decided to wait for it. Delivery company was very responsive though and worked with me to get the TV delivered. Works well and has a great picture. Super easy to setup if you have a Samsung account. You can charge the remote control by the little solar panel on it or by USB-C. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone."
"Beautiful picture and perfect size, exactly what I was looking for"
"I spent a lot of time reading the specs on 4K and 8K models.I opted for 4K as the overwhelming content is in 4K.I chose this model for its overall superior qualities, first off most of the bargain units you find are 60 Hz which can lead to motion blur in action scenes and sporting events. This unit is 120Hz.Inputs the bargain units have a couple HDMI  This one has Four HDMI, 1 Coaxial, 1 Network, 1 Optical and they even included 2 USB.The picture quality is excelent,The set auto adjusts brightness much better than my older Sony XBR which I was happy with.The second I connected my computer to this monitor my computer recognized it and adjusted itself properly, the disply was a perfect fit on the screen. 4K res and the font was big enough to read comfortably.I am not a game player so I cannot offer to review on what I have not done.As for the built in AI feature, the unit offers the user to have ""Alexa"" or Samsungs ""Bixby"" As we already had an Alexa device in the room I opted to configure the Bixby option.  Both are equally as frustraiting and flawed, and helpful as you allow them to be.This particular model comes with Samsun+  tv a very nice freebee it does require high speed interet to funtion. ""As does the AI.I hope you find this helpful."
"I ordered this 65” Samsung as part of Amazons Prime Days sale. The TV is great. Very modern and thin with several HDMI ports for accessories. The picture is great and the set up was pretty easy. It didn’t take long to go through the wizard and add all my apps and streaming services. We use DirectTV streaming and the app works great along with all the others. We also purchased a Samsung soundbar with subwoofer and the set up with the TV was super easy and paired immediately. Only giving 4 stars because the delivery was terrible. You set up the delivery date after purchase and it was a week, not Prime. That would have been fine but on my date of delivery (which I needed to work at home for) they didn’t show up and they didn’t even notify me. The next day no communication either! They finally acknowledged they didn’t show up and my next delivery date was almost 10 days later. Took 3 weeks for a Prime delivery, clearly they were just trying to sell TVs but anyway, the product is good. Recommend the Samsung soundbar and sub as well."
"Likes: easy to setup since I already had account with Samsung .Its much easier to connect with internet if you use Ethernet connection .The weight of TV was little surprising when I set the tv up myself ,much easier if you use two.Packing was outstanding for great protection and preservation in shipping .I used SMART THINGS APP of Samsung and calibrated tv with my IPhone and it was an outstanding and easy setup.Picture quality is beautiful ,sound I use Yamaha receiver and connectivity was flawless .DIRECTV 4K channels are so beautiful .Electronics of Samsung is a perfect choice you cannot go wrong .I highly recommend this Tv even though they say it’s mid range .Watching tv at a slight angle was unnoticeable of any flaws .Overall I give this Tv ease of assembly A+,Picture quality A+,Sound A,Remote you will lose because it is small if not careful but it serves its purpose .Amazon delivery was handled with care and excellent ."
"My SagaI bought the Samsung 65-inch Class QLED in mid-September. Two weeks later it stopped working. I called Samsung and they said they would send a technician over which took about two weeks (granted I was away on travel for five days).After chatting with the appliance company, I sent them photos of what the screen was doing so that they could bring the right parts. But when the service technician got there, he replaced the parts but the TV did not work. He said the display failed. He said that he would have to come back with a new display that took another two weeks. He came back change the display and it still didn’t work, claiming that the display he had was bad. I called Samsung again and they said they would initiate an exchange. The exchange would take 10 to 15 days. Then they informed me that it would be at least until Nov. 27 before they would call to set up delivery of an exchanged TV. I got an appointment for delivery on December 6. And it was delivered.It’s not that the staff was at fault or bad. The appliance company was very accommodating- they came on-time. Samsung staff always responded with texts and emails. The two-delivery people were very helpful. They put it together and set it up.The problem is Samsung’s process that it takes so long to get this completed.The Samsung policy with a product this new should be an immediate credit or immediate exchange.Now to the product:The Home Screen is terribly designed, not intuitive and quite ugly. The remote is full of advertising buttons and it has a bad design compared to older ones that had this nice curve design that fit well in your hand. Worst of all the remote cannot control audio when you are using the optical output- and I even have a Samsung soundbar! Switching between connected device is slow.I would have expected more for $1,000."
"This was my first purchase of tv online and must say I am extremely satisfied with the product"
"This Product is really good, pretty user friendly and compatible, picture clarity and refresh rate are really awesome. Sound also really good more than expectation compared with price"
"Resumption is high quality"
"2 Pin Plug . I doubt ESMA Certifications.Not recommended in UAE."
"I needed to replace a 50"" TV in my sun room. Much ambient light coming through surround windows. The picture that my new QLED 4K QN85D Series Neo Quantum 55"" TV is quite brilliant despite the amount of ambient light. It arrived promptly, was unboxed and assembled after viewing a YouTube video showing how this is done. I highly recommend the YouTube unpacking video as there are some parts of the re-assemble that are not explained in the almost useless directions supplied."
"Love everything about my Samsung TV.  Great product for a good price.  Picture is sharp and colors vibrant.  Stereo sound is unbelievable!  Very happy with my purchase!"
"Bought from and shipped by Amazon. Amazon Prime delivery and Amazon Prime return were 5 star. Because of the likelihood of needing to return this TV, this should be kept in mind.For the same reason, consider taking detailed pictures of how the TV is packed when unpacking it. In particular, take pictures of how the two parts of the stand are placed in the styrofoam packing. Also, pay close attention to how the stand goes together. In returning it, you will need to disassemble the two pieces, and this can be difficult to do. Of course, save the box and all the packing material.Problems From Day One:Bluetooth audio lag: this problem was constant, though it varied in severity.Blurring, staccato picture:Example: A race car quickly moving down a racetrack and filmed through the windshield: the road in front of the car was a blurry, muddy mess, only having clarity farther in the distance.Example: People twirling flags. The flags had a distracting, strobe like jump throughout the movements.Remote Control: The remote in size, shape and color very much resembles an Amazon Fire Stick remote. However, whereas the Fire Stick remote feels solid and well-made, the Samsung remote because it has no batteries and is solar powered, feels flimsy. Using it, it feels not at all durable and feels like it  will break with normal usage.Dead by Day Seven:With hardly more than 12 hours of use during the first week, the TV simply and  completely died.Returned thereafter."
"I’ve always been a fan of Samsung TV’s. I’ll probably purchase a new one for my  bedroom at Christmas. Amazon made it easy."
"The tv is awesome"
"I'm not a connoisseur of TVs but this is fantastic! I feel like I'm at the theater!"
"Purchased this TV specifically for watching sports because of how high it was rated for clarity. The picture is great when watching 4k content. Picture also great on most channels. Tends to be a little grainy at times with older TV shows but that is to be expected. Where it fails immensely is watching sports, specifically football, where any fast motion becomes completely blurry. I tried watching YouTube to solve these issues and found a ton of content on this because apparently this is a problem that they said could be cured in picture settings. I must have tried at least a dozen recommendations. I talked to Samsung product support and they couldn’t fix it either. They kept saying it was likely a cable signal problem. I have two other Samsung TV’s including an older one and their pictures are better. I also did a signal test for cable and it was very strong. Also tried hooking the TV up directly to the cable modem with a high quality Ethernet cable and the picture did not improve.I would not recommend this TV if you want your sports to be clear. It is good for most other things."
"The picture is beautifuland sharp. I received a good deal on Prime Day"
"The 75 inch TV arrived on schedule and was easy to set up on the legs. I would strongly urge reading the unpacking instructions provided on the outside of the box, makes life so much more simple. You're going to need at least 3 people to unpack and set up. I used the legs that came with the tv but may mount on the wall in the future. You're going to need two people to hold the tv (it's pretty heavy) and the third will need to slide the legs into the slots on the back. I hadn't realized that there are little white clips in the leg that, when extended, raise the tv up about 2 inches higher (for extra clearance, like the sound bar I bought to go with it). One clip in the legs was up and the other was down and it took a few tries to figure out why my tv was sitting at an angle, but after a quick second glance at the instructions I realized my error and fixed it. You will have to apply some blunt force to the legs to get them all the way in to the slots. This tv has a ton of features, I would suggest looking up videos and articles to figure them all out. I am a former ROKU user so I was hesitant and went ahead and bought a ROKU ultra to plug into this, but after getting used to the layout and navigation of this tv I'll likely be returning the ROKU. This has all the main streaming channels I used to watch on my ROKU, I just had to get used to the new layout. Picture is very nice, I'm no expert but for the price, you're going to get an amazing picture (I did have to lower the brightness from 50 to 25, not sure if that's the default but it was a bit too bright at first). The rechargeable remote (same as charging a phone) is great, even has a small solar panel on the back to recharge when you aren't using it (though you'll have to put the remote face down). The remote has a mic on it and once I installed Alexa on it it works like a charm. I just tell the remote what I want to watch and BAM!, it goes right to it! Worth the money, worth the time, very happy customer."
"The SAMSUNG 55-Inch Class 4K Crystal UHD DU8000 Series Smart TV has exceeded my expectations. The picture quality is stunning, with vibrant colors and deep contrasts thanks to the 4K Crystal UHD and HDR features. Watching movies, sports, and shows has never looked better!One of the standout features is Object Tracking Sound (OTS), which creates a more immersive audio experience by tracking the action on the screen. It’s a small but impactful detail that really enhances the viewing experience, especially for action-packed content.The smart features are intuitive, with easy access to streaming services like Netflix and YouTube, and the built-in voice control makes navigation effortless. Setting up the TV was a breeze, and the slim design makes it look sleek in any room.The only minor drawback I found is that the remote feels a bit basic compared to some higher-end models, but it still gets the job done. Overall, this TV is a fantastic value for anyone looking for a great 4K experience without breaking the bank. Highly recommend!"
"Tv works good picture is great.  The delivery went smooth, brought in the house, unboxed and turned on to check before leaving"
"Perfect delivery and the size is unbelievable. A bit heavy so I’m lucky I workout and was able to set it up on my own. Great sound, beautiful quality and imagery. Only thing I will say is the apps can be glitchy and slow. I bought a YouTube movie yesterday and it glitched and was having a hard time loading about 4-6x through the movie which was a bit annoying. If you aren’t tech savvy the remote and in-phone remote system might be difficult to understand and use but you’ll get the hang of it. I recommend this for the price. $700-ish after taxes and free delivery is a steal. Hopefully the glitchy stuff resolves a bit"
"I’m upgrading from a 2019 Philips 65” 4K TV. Only because the Philips wouldn’t restart after a power surge.Every other thing did. (Yes I do use surge protectors)This Samsung is the first TV I’ve bought since 2020. I didn’t realize the advances in technology and looks.It’s also the first Samsung I’ve owned, ever. I’ve only had it for about 36 hours as of now, but it’s becoming more easy to use and navigate the menu. I’m not completely familiar with it yet, though.The only complaint I have, and this may sound crazy to some, is that the picture may be TOO CLEAR.It has what is described in some YouTube videos as the “soap opera effect”. Watching some movies on Dish Network and BluRay, it seems as if the viewer is watching the characters live instead of in a movie. The picture can be adjusted to different settings, to reduce this effect, that are more to the viewer’s preference. And there are many “micro adjustments” that can be made, appropriately enough called “expert settings”. I’m no expert though.I don’t regret the purchase at all. But, if I’d watched those videos before buying, I might have chosen to buy another model Samsung. Or maybe even a different brand. Mostly because I learned that Samsung doesn’t support Dolby Vision or Sound. I have my 7.1 surround system for sound anyway, so that’s not a problem for me. Anyone who is dependent on the TVs sound capability, should be aware of the fact that Samsung and Dolby Vision don’t play together.I’ll get used to this new TV soon. But I should have done more research before buying it. I guess 5 years is a very long time to jump in TV technology nowadays. One more thing about Samsung that surprised me is that they don’t supply the mounting screws for their TVs. I had to order some separately from Amazon. The ones I found are the right thread size, but (when using included spacers) are at least 1/4” too long, maybe 5/16”. I learned elsewhere that the recommended thread depth is 11-13mm. A person can either use more spacers or cut them off at the right thread length.This is a positive review. I know that I bought a great TV at a good price (approx. $640). I’m just going to have to get used to all the new technology it has. And the super clear picture will take me time to get used to for sure. Even though my 2019 Philips was a 4K TV as well, it was nowhere near as clear as this 2024 Samsung."
"I’ve been using the HP DeskJet 2855e for a couple of weeks now, and I’m quite impressed with what it offers for a budget-friendly printer. Here’s my detailed breakdown:Design and Build QualityThe HP DeskJet 2855e has a compact and lightweight design that easily fits on a small desk or shelf. Its clean white exterior gives it a modern, minimalist look. While it's made mostly of plastic, the build feels sturdy enough for regular home office use.Setup and ConnectivitySetting up the printer was a breeze! The wireless setup is straightforward using the HP Smart app, and it connected to my Wi-Fi without any issues. I was able to print from my laptop, smartphone, and even my tablet effortlessly. It also supports AirPrint, which is a plus for Apple users.Print QualityFor a printer in this price range, the print quality is decent. Black-and-white documents come out sharp and clear. Color prints are vibrant, though not professional-grade quality. It works well for everyday tasks like printing homework, forms, or casual photos. If you're printing high-resolution images or need professional color prints, you might want to look at higher-end models.PerformanceThis printer performs well for basic tasks. It’s not the fastest, but it's good enough for occasional use. The scan and copy functions work as expected, and having these features in one device is convenient for a home office setup. However, if you plan to print a lot, the print speed might be a bit slow for your liking.Ink and Running CostsHP includes 6 months of free Instant Ink with the purchase of this model, which is a fantastic deal. The Instant Ink program automatically delivers ink to your door before you run out, and it’s based on the number of pages you print, not how much ink you use. After the trial period, you’ll need to subscribe to a plan, which can be affordable depending on your printing needs. Otherwise, HP ink cartridges can be pricey, so this is something to keep in mind.Pros:Compact and space-saving designWireless connectivity with mobile printingEasy setup with HP Smart appFree 6 months of Instant InkAffordable priceCons:Print speed is slow, especially for large documentsColor printing quality is averageInk cartridges can be expensive without Instant Ink subscriptionOverall, the HP DeskJet 2855e is a solid choice if you're looking for an affordable all-in-one printer for light home use. It’s easy to set up, works wirelessly with multiple devices, and includes free Instant Ink, making it a great deal for casual users. However, it’s not ideal if you need high-quality color prints or fast print speeds for heavy workloads."
"I thought it was going to be something complicated to understand on how to get it set up and print any papers i needed. On the contrary it’s simple with the app, i can print any image/ google doc/ email, etc. I haven’t used the other features it has but so far it’s been AMAZING, you can select the quality/ size of your paper. The only “problem” i would say it has is its not bluetooth compatible, that i know of, so i can’t connect to my laptop without downloading app again in it."
"Summary:- tried, unsuccessfully, to set the printer up to print from my son’s iPhone and his laptop- printer set-up app will not allow connecting to the university wifi as it is a public network (according to the HP agent)- the set up app does not give an option to complete the set up with an Ethernet cable (cable NOT provided) even though the printer does have an Ethernet port - the manual specifically discourages the use of the Ethernet port as it will restrict the use of some features. Not to mention that obviously the use of an Ethernet cable only allows connecting to a computer and not a smart phone- HP recommends on their website to use the chat option for support as it is faster. Customer support via chat is terrible in response time and support provided- in the end, 40 min wasted on the chat - problem not resolved - stuck with a printer I cannot return as it is past the return deadline - ordered an Ethernet cable and praying it will at least let my son print from his laptopDetails:I purchased this printer earlier this summer for my son to take to his college dorm room. He moved in yesterday and proceeded to set it up to print from his iPhone and his laptop using wifi. He is on campus in the dorms so the wifi is the one provided by the university to the students. The printer would not let us set it up saying this wifi network was not supported by the printer/hp app, to try another network or contact HP support. The printer does have an Ethernet port (cable NOT provided) but the setup app only offered the option to set up by wifi, no option to set up using an Ethernet cable. The printer manual  also specifically discourages the use of an Ethernet cable and warns it will not allow access to all the printer features. They even mention that they cover the Ethernet port on the printer with a sticker to deter people from using it. And obviously you cannot connect an Ethernet cable to a smart phone. The printer does NOT come with an Ethernet cable so we could not test it. I contacted HP support via their website chat using the link provided in the error message. I had to wait 20 min before being connected to an agent. But the frustrating part was the delay in response from the agent between each single question/answer. The agent asked 2 basic questions in 2 posts - first post was to provide info to identify myself and the printer - second post was to confirm my problem statement. I answered each question immediately and had to wait at least 5 min after each answer to get his feedback. I know it was at least that long as each post on the chat is marked with the time it was sent. After 15 min of wait (in addition to the initial 20 min to be connected to an agent), he answered that the university wifi was a public network and therefore would not work. He advised to try using the hotspot from my son’s iPhone. I answered that my son’s phone carrier/plan does not allow for hotspot so that couldn’t work. I once again waited and waited for an answer and gave up. I cannot return the printer as it is past the return deadline. I ordered an Ethernet cable and hope that will work with the laptop even though the setup does not offer that option and the manual specifically says that connecting via Ethernet is not as good as it does not allow access to all the features. As for printing from the iPhone I guess that is not possible. Could not be more disappointed by the terrible customer support and lack of information in the manual!"
"The HP DeskJet 2855e is a decent all-in-one printer for basic home use. It handles printing, scanning, and copying well, and the wireless setup is convenient once you figure it out. The print quality is fine for everyday documents, but it’s not great for photos or heavy-duty use. The 3 months of ink included is a nice perk, though the cartridges run out quickly if you print a lot. It’s compact and affordable, and you get what you pay for—it’s a solid choice for light home use but don’t expect premium performance."
"I liked that I got it 3 days earlier than the expected date. My disc drive drawer won't open so I am unable to run the disc. Best way. I went to the website and downloaded the installation program. Every printer I've ever had in 50 years asks if you want the printer to be the Primary Printer, answer Y. Do you want an icon on the tool bar, answer Y. This printer asked neither. I read setup with WiFi. I did what it said and it could find the WiFi. It's the same distance from the WiFi as the computer and it's connected. I'll uninstall it and install it again. If I fail to connect again I'll go find some kid that studied how to hook up a printer to a PC in school and have him/her do it."
"It quit printing and we had to purchase the ink from them online to keep the machine going.... that's wrong!"
"Decent printer for the price. Works well, easy to setup."
"If you looking for a home printer and don’t want a huge fight setting it up, buy this printer.  We were replacing our old printer and my husband had picked out something else.  The other printer came with a lot of instructions on how to unpack it and to set it up.  After fighting with the setup (which was never finished) the printer was sent back.  I on the other hand had been looking at this printer, so now it’s happy sitting on the desk next to me.  It was easy to unpack and set up.  Just install the HP software and within a few minutes, the printer was installed on my laptop and hooked into WIFI with ease.  A few more minutes it was installed on my husband’s computer and our phones.  I couldn’t be happier with this purchase.  It doesn’t take up a lot of space which is great.  It’s a little slow on the printing but that does not bother me the least bit.  It’s a fantastic printer!"
"I have tried new inks, bought a cable that connects from the printer to my laptop. It works when it feels like it."
"So far no surprises, quick set up and the app is very responsive"
"Mine is for home use and works well.Great price and the quality l expect from HP."
"So I did some research and this HP Color LaserJet Pro looked nice and compact, it had some good reviews, and the price was right.  I checked it out on some YouTube videos for setup and replacing toner cartridges and everything was so simple to do.  I only use Macs and the Color LaserJet Pro was supposedly compatible with macOS.  So, I took the printer out of the box, ran the initial setup, checked the toner cartridges, put in some paper, ran the print demo, connected to my 2.4 GHz WiFi Network, and printed a one-page PDF file from my 2015 MacBook Pro in another room.  I didn't need to install any HP drivers or anything else.  The printer was instantly recognized on my network and was ready to go after a minute or so of initialization.  Now the LaserJet Pro connects and prints instantly whenever I turn it on.I have to say this printer puts out some beautiful print and it will likely be the last printer I will ever need.  I was blown away by the color-print demo.  I don't know why I waited so long to buy a decent laser printer.  I don't think this printer is expensive at all and as long as the toner cartridges stay working, I don't mind paying the price of genuine HP toner cartridges.  It will probably take me years to use up the toner in those cartridges and I even bought a spare black toner cartridge just in case.  I am honestly pleased with this Color LaserJet Pro and I highly recommend it for basic print jobs.  Printing from my Mac running Mojave OS was a breeze.  I don't think printing gets any easier than this.  I'm going to play around with it a bit, such as printing from my smartphone or my other Macs.  I basically use my MacBook Pro laptop daily to do everything, so that's all I need to print from.  I really didn't need a color laser printer, but now I have one if I ever need to print something in color.  For me, it's totally worth it if I'm going to use it for years.  The printer came in handy right away, as I need to return a corrupted PNY SSD to Amazon, so I printed the return shipment code to give to the UPS store.  I had to give this printer a 5-star rating.  I don't see any cons for the short-term.  If it keeps on working as it is, then it's perfect.I bought this Color LaserJet Pro as a replacement printer for some older crappy, multi-function HP Color-Jet printer I had been using over the past few years.  I rarely print anything, so on occasion (every few months), whenever I needed to print or copy something important, the ink-jet cartridge was either partially clogged or dried out.  That's even after I removed the ink-jet cartridges, used the nozzle cover, and placed them in plastic ZipLoc bags.  It drove me bonkers and so I decided to trash that freaking ink-jet printer.  No more ink-jets for me.  I wasn't trying to save money.  It's just that I rarely printed documents and didn't realize there was a problem with those crappy ink-jet cartridges always getting clogged no matter how carefully I treated them.  My advice is... Stay away from ink-jet printers for document printing unless you're going to use them every day."
"I will say that this printer was easy to set up, it prints quick, the print quality is amazing and it looks sleek.  There's only one thing I don't love - I find it very hard to use the envelope tray.  It's hard to get the envelope or paper in the slot.  And . . . if you don't have it in the slot right it sucks it in crooked.  Still would buy this again, but that is the one drawback I did want to mention."

I got this to replace an Epson inkjet printer that had been declining over the last few years and stopped printing most colors. This is by far the most expensive printer I've ever purchased, but I wanted a really good quality printer that would last me a long time and print reliably every time. So far, I'm really pleased.Initial Setup - I was a little concerned after reading reviews that it would take me hours and several calls to customer support to get this thing set up, but it was actually really easy. The instructions list a website to visit to download the software, so I just followed the instructions and was all set up within a few minutes. I did not need to connect the printer to any computers, I just followed the instructions and was able to get everything connected. Make sure you download the mobile and desktop apps and register on the HP Smart website, where you can manage your printer settings.Mobile App - I didn't love the idea of using a mobile app for a printer, but it is actually pretty cool. There's a lot of neat features on there, like printables, which has a bunch of free things to print, such as calendars, coloring pages, activity sheets, cards, crafts, all sorts of stuff! There's also mobile faxing and scanning, the ability to create photo books and more. I probably won't use many of these features, but I do think they are nice to have.Print Quality - I don't print a ton of stuff, but I did a few test prints and they look fantastic so far. Nice quality and clean printing.Mobile Printing - I didn't have to do anything special to print a photo from my phone. I just opened the photo on my phone, tapped the share icon, selected print, and it defaulted to the printer. It took about 30 seconds, but the quality was great on regular printer paper. You may need to keep the photo/file open until you see the print dialog on your phone show that the item is printing.Scan to Email - This was a bit challenging to set up, but I found a helpful article so I'll share how I did this. First, from the desktop HP Smart app, I added our email addresses to the address book in the scan tab. You also MUST have an outgoing email address set up in order to scan to email, so I created a Gmail account for the scanner. In the outgoing email profiles, I added this email address, used smtp.gmail.com for the server and port 465. Check the ""SMTP server requires authentication"" box and enter the email address & password. When I tested it, I got an email that Google blocked the attempt so I researched and found an article instructing to allow less secure apps and had a link (just add /settings/security/lesssecureapps to the Google URL to access this setting). I turned less secure apps on for the printer account, and that did the trick. Note that  a copy of each scan will be saved in the sent folder of that email account.2-Sided Printing - This was not the default setting on my printer, but I was able to select my default print settings from the HP Smart websiteTouchscreen - I think the touchscreen is easy to use. If setup is required for anything, it will display a message explaining exactly how to do what's needed, so that's really helpful.I've only had this printer a short time, but I'm really pleased with it so far."
"Exactly what we needed. Works great. Attractive looking and well made. Has all the functions we were looking for and is sturdy and reliable."
"This printer provides the best compromise for someone who is used to the full size office printing  infrastructure but doesn't want to spend 10s of thousands of dirhams on a home printer. The set up with WiFi was very easy to do, although the app can be slightly misleading if you don't check the process carefully. The printing quality is great and is more than adequate if you just need a hard copy to read instead of staring at something on a screen for hours. Colour quality is also excellent and photos come out great. Overall, it's an excellent home printer that scans and copies quickly too."
"The printer was purchased for my wife to use with her business. She had issues and simply would not use it; she kept going back to an older HP Printer that had its own set of issues but printed better than this. So, there were a small number of print jobs on it when I decided to see what was going on. I should have done this sooner. I saw that there were serious print issues that I could not resolve. So, I contacted HP Support, and they went through things with me. In the end, they shipped a replacement printer.All is well with the replacement printer. Excellent print quality, and scan quality. All is well and I highly recommend, as always, HP Printers. The most important feature of a purchase is support, and I must say that HP excelled in this area."
"Due to some not so good reviews I was a bit skeptical about getting this printer, however my gut instinct told me to get itI’m glad I did! This printer works really well, it does it all even print photos. I’ve put this printer thru the ringer and it’s so good. The price was fair, there’s no paper jam, no error messages, and the quality of the color is excellent! Speed not bad at all, remember this is a HP printer not a Concorde…"
"HP has gone from a leader in printers to junk dealer from the physical printer itself, to the install, to the tech support, to the entire spectrum of what they could do wrong. If I had simply ignored all their instructions and help, especially the ""HP SMART"" software,  I would have likely had this setup and working within 30 minutes.  However, the setup guide said ""install the REQUIRED HP Smart software"" (it was in bold in the instructions).  It was a confusing, complicated, install that was mostly a hard hard sell for instant ink and kept requiring me to give info.  It never gave me any opportunity to give my own name to the printer, my own IP address, turn off feature such as Wi-Fi direct.  When I called the HP support it went from an automated voice insisting I give my serial number and not finding it thus dropping me.  Going online and entering my just activated serial number from a package I received today to something that has already lost two months of warranty? WTF? And now I supposed to provide evidence that I just got it? Doesnt the fact the serial number was just activated prove that.  I was dropped not once but twice after calling tech support.  After going thru at least 4 separate phone calls, I finally got a tech who said I didnt need to install the allegedly required HP SMART and could have set it up from the screen, download he few drivers, used the embedded web service, and did it all easily.  So after cleaning it all off, reconfiguring to my needs, and thinking I am all done, the HP Support goes down so now I cant even download drivers.  I have an HP Laserjet 4 built in 1995 (yes 1995) that still works fine.  I had a Office Jet Pro that lasted 10 years (which you couldnt even get a repair manual for).  I then bought another Office Jet Pro that worked fine for 5 years and then the printhead died and they dont make the part for it.  Now I have this one which I cant even get to work.  All HP wants to do is sell cheap printers and expensive ink.  I will never purchase another HP productPS: Even after an additional half dozen phone calls, my hardware warranty was put to the proper place but inexplicably is now set back to original incorrect date.  I have returned the product and am now using an old canon printer"
"Printer is easy to set up, easy to use, very fast! The only thing is I tried to print on cardstock and the ink wouldn’t show."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I was worried about this printer because there were so many bad reviews but I had no problems what so ever setting it up. I scanned the QR that came up after I powered on the printer and I already had the app on my phone from my old printer so that was easy. It found my internet and connected the printer quickly. The printer did have an update so that took a couple of minutes but after that I was able to add the printer to my computer, again through the HP Smart app and it printed my documents beautifully. It’s a bit loud but no louder than any other home printer I’ve had. The color is perfect and it printed quickly. I choose not to do the instant ink trial after reading the reviews on that but it let me decline with no problems. So far I would recommend but it’s only my first day. Will try to come back with an update later on."
"All the features work as expected, but the best part is the fantastic photos!"
"Trashed my Epson Ecotank after 14 months of frustrations. Never should have tried Epson, so happy to be back with HP. This is how I expect a printer to work!"
"I should have bought this one in the first place, all applications work well and the setup was a breeze, just have to figure out why when I press the scan to computer option on the printer display it brings up the w11 scanner option and not the HP option, if you launch the hp option from pc it works better gives you the ADP or glass option for scanning. Like all printer ink is expensive so if you print a lot opt for the instant ink option"
"I recently started using the HP Envy Inspire 7955e All-in-One Printer, and I’m delighted with its performance. This printer not only meets but surpasses my expectations with its high-quality output and versatile functionality.Setting up the printer was a breeze, and the print quality is excellent, whether I’m printing documents, photos, or creative projects. The addition of the HP+ Instant Ink bonus for three months is a fantastic perk, ensuring I never run out of ink unexpectedly and saving on printing costs.The all-in-one capabilities are incredibly convenient; the printer handles scanning, copying, and printing with ease, making it a valuable addition to my home office. The wireless connectivity is reliable, and the mobile printing options make it easy to send documents from anywhere.Overall, the HP Envy Inspire 7955e has proven to be a reliable and efficient printer, offering great value with the Instant Ink subscription. It’s an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-performance, multifunction printer. Highly recommended!"
"Over the last 40 years I have always bought HP Printers. This one is a beauty so light does everything the Manual says it does and oh so quietly. Best printer I have ever owned. Thank you HP!"
"I've only printed 5 pages that were grey shaded...printed as bluish.  Now printer says nearly empty for coloured ink.  What's going on?  I really like the printer otherwise."
"got this printer.opened box and followed instructions. was unable to open the "" cartridge door"". turns out the "" printer door has to be closed to open the cartridge door.This was resolved after chatting with the HP mobile support team.There could be a little note or focus put on this in the video presentation that accompanies the printer.Anyways, printer works great. happy with purchase... ( outside of the frustration related to set up and video chat!... if you ever do need the video chat support from HP, I will say that it is fabulous!)"
"I ordered the HP 3201 DW and so far it has met my expectations.  I upgraded to a laser printer for my home office needs and after reading the pros and cons, I took a chance on this model and after a week, I have to say things are going well. The colors are vibrant, the printing is quick and relatively quiet. I have an IMac so the setup was instant and easy.  I plugged it in, my wife hit a few buttons and wah-lah .. wifi printing.  No HP downloads and it even works with Samsung.  I print directly from my Samsung cell phone with no challenges at all. I am pleased with the delivery, ease of use, quality, size, price and appearance. This is supposedly the ""newer"" version and I did purchase the extended warranty just in case."
"I purchased this used like new from Amazon, saved a few bucks but you never know what quality the items might be buying used.  The box had been opened and there was printer paper in the drawer but not many copies had been made according to the toner levels.  I did a factory reset so I could start setting up from scratch and then did a firmware update.  I sent an Amazon webpage from my ipad to the printer once setup on our wifi, wow, the print quality is so much better than the HP 8610 pro I replaced this with, outstanding colors and the paper didn‚Äôt wilt like with the liquid printers I have had.  I sent an HD picture from my ipad to the printer, it is amazing how the colors are so real, very happy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so far so good with this color laser printer!"
"It is borderline unusable over wifi.Easy to setup, easy to use, print quality is fine as well. Plug it in, connect it to wifi, add it to your laptop or phone, print. Easy. Everything works fine the first time.However next time you try to print anything from the laptop or the phone nothing will work. It will say ""printer is offline"" and after that, no matter what you do to it, there is no reliable way to refresh its status and force it to print anything. Reboot the printer - doesn't matter, says ""offline"", reboot the laptop - doesn't matter, ""offline"". Re-connect the printer to wifi, doesn't matter - ""offline"".The stupidest thing is that when you open the HP app on the same laptop the app does see the printer and recognizes it as online. Shows you the status, the toner level. But you can't print anything, print queue and print dialogs say it's offline.Then randomly after a few minutes (or a lot of minutes, it's random) it would get recognized as online again and you would be able to print. Until you pause for some period and it becomes offline again. Repeat.There are ""troubleshooting"" steps like making a default printer, some other similar suggestions. They help maybe once, after the period of inactivity you will be back at square one, everything will say it's offline. And at that point it's already a default printer and all troubleshooting steps performed. Nothing helps.Same when printing from the phone. Trying to add it from the print dialog works the first time. Next times it would say offline. Sometimes it would randomly recognize it as online after a few minutes of staring at the print dialog. But sometimes it wouldn't. When you try to add it over wifi direct it would work the first time. But then again, next time it's offline. And if you remove and attempt to add it again - good luck, the phone would find it but you won't be able to install it.Or you can install HP smart app and whatever other apps it requires to print from the phone. It won't see the printer. But then after you lose the patience and go back to the print dialog, it would be available in the dialog using the HP plugin. What is going on.....Doesn't matter the OS either. MacOS, Windows, Android - same things. Doesn't matter the wifi quality, gone through multiple routers, different bands, through other different settings, and currently sitting right next to it on the same network, unable to print anything but able to do everything else over the same wifi.I dread the next time I need to print anything, I will need to go over all possible combinations of random actions that I think are related. I feel like I am following a cargo cult, where I need to perform some weird dance and press random things in hope that the pinter gods will allow me to send the PDF over and I would get it on a paper by some magic.How hard it is to implement a reliable working wifi printer driver?"
"I was tired of my laser jet printed pages smearing if they got damp, etc. I decided to try this Laserjet printer and am so glad I did! I have had it for over a year now and am really impressed with its performance and print quality. I buy the high yield cartridges and am impressed with how easy they are to install and replace. Just pull out a tray, remove the spent cartridge by lifting it out, and pop in a new one. Once the tray is reinserted it will go trough a short cycle to get the cartridge ready and to calibrate. We have had minimal issues with connectivity, paper jams, or other technical issues. I did need to reconnect the printer to our router once or twice, but it is easy to do. It seems to go through walls well. My husband‚Äôs office is across the house and in in the back from mine but he connects just fine. Paper is easy to change sizes or to refill. The print quality is so much better than my old HP Officejet!! The only con for me is the high cost of the proprietary cartridges, but that is part of the cost of owning a LaserJet. I have replaced the black toner twice and two of the color ones twice in the past 15 months but your mileage will vary depending on how much you print. I do plan to start another business this fall so I know I will use more toner and paper once that happens.I do recommend that you buy a full set of high yield cartridges to keep on hand as the cartridges that come with the printer do not last that long. When one color or black cartridge is spent, I order another spare for the next time to keep on hand as the colors run out at different times. There is a newer model I see but if the price is good do not hesitate to buy this one."
"I had previously purchase (kinda sorta) same; my mistake not seeing clearly it was not a colored printer. So I found THIS one. Great reviews! Home office. Set up was a bit challenging without the onscreen (touch screen) but fairly doable to do manually. Boom thought all was good for one week. Went to print again and asked to log in (again); wifi not connected (again) but ok, I had not printed in 5 days so perhaps it did not quite connect. (what do I know...); tried again and still nothing; turn off, turn on, reset. frustrating. They saw an alert; ""you may have run out of toner"" really? One week? and (toner) low? But ok, perhaps I was sent a printer that isn't up to par for making a mistake ordering original. Now trying to buy a toner. No guidance (this is the toner you need for the printer you just purchased) - which makes me weary to buy and make another mistake. Other than that, when it prints, it prints nicely. #twocents"
"It has been the best purchase for a printer."
"it works - exactly what i need from it"
"We installed this as a second home printer. I LOVE the black and white laser.It is fast and cheap. This one even does automatic duplex printing to save paper.The B&W is fine for us. We ran through so many color cartridges over the years when my wife printed out recipes or craft ideas. The B&W is fine for us--and so much cheaper. The cartridges last us probably over a year.We have not tried the envelopes function. Easy connection via the HP setup process.Make sure to put the printer on the same WiFi as the laptops/smartphones/iPads in the house. We have a WiFi repeater that we use for better coverage--you have to make sure they are all on the same network."
"Works great, easy set up."
"I purchased this product in August, 2023.  Shortly after the return window closed I started having trouble with the wifi feature.  There isn't a display screen to work with so everything is a guessing game.  This week the lights went out and I haven't been able to turn it on.  The quality of the printing was good when you could get it to print, but I finally had to use a print cable because it would randomly disconnect from our wifi.  I don't recommend this product."
"I have this set up on local network. My desktop (wired connection) has no issue in printing to it. Our laptop (Wireless) will print to it with no problem.For some reason, it would print an extra page with just ""PDF"" on it. HP Support suggested unplugging it, holding down the power button for 15 seconds, and reconnecting / restarting. That resolved the issue.Minor Suggestion - You can go into the Printer Preferences and change it to ""Economode"" and save toner."
"I used a MacBook Pro to configure WiFi printing. Put paper in printer and pushed the power button. However the paper jam light stayed on. When I downloaded and ran smarthp program it would not find the printer  probably because paper jam light was on. I removed the paper tray and reinserted it. This time the paper jam light was not on. I was then able to see the printer. The rest of the installation was fine. I opted to not use the hp cloud printing. The print quality, speed, and WiFi connectivity are great. Unlike my old hp printer, it‚Äôs always connected to my network. No more having to restart the printer because you can‚Äôt see it on the network."
"My boss bought this for me and I love it!  Quite and quick!"
"I have this sitting on an island counter, so wifi for me is a must. Quite a workhorse of a printer."
"This is generally a good printer with sharp print quality, no jams yet after 2 months. But like others, I have had frequent issues with it going offline and not being findable by my computer -- not by wifi, not even when it plug it straight into my Mac.  I've got all the drivers etc updated, still the same problem.  It happens every week or two, seemingly at random, and just takes endless restarts and reinstalls before it'll come back again. This is clearly a software problem, and HP really needs to get on top of it."
"Printer works decently, the setup was quite easy, the print quality is good and the toner page yield is fairly decent. I wish it had an inbuilt scanner. Nonetheless, I would recommend for a home office or small business. I‚Äôve had the printer for a month but i will edit this if any changes after 6months."
"Very basic black & white printing, exactly what I need.Easy set up on Wifi"
"When changing the ink cartridge for the first time the contact roller came dislodged which prevented me from properly installing the new cartridge.  I contacted Amazon support which was less than useless as my ""return window"" expired two days ago.Do yourself a favour and choose another printer and also buy your electronics through a reputable store.  The multi-billion dollar Amazon company can't help out their loyal Prime members in their times of need."
"Wifi printing didn't work for me but that's fine as long as it prints ,fine by me."
"Can‚Äôt give it 5 because I‚Äôve only used it 3 times.I recently bought a bunch of new tech items and most of them were fancy but didn‚Äôt work. I returned them all.This printer actually works! Does what it says!!Shocking right?Yes it comes with a toner cartridge. (don‚Äôt forget to buy paper!)1) You‚Äôll need a driver for your computer:"
"This HP printer is a fantastic little machine. It’s small but can do a lot! Prints come out bright and clear, and it’s super fast. The touchscreen is easy to use, and you can connect it to your wireless network. Plus, it can copy and scan too. If you need a printer that can handle it all, this one is a good choice."
"Print, I have been looking at this preserve for a while and it was on sale at Sam's club and it was actually cheaper here. I think it's great quality and it solves a lot of problems from me when I work from home. Quality printing is perfect for presentations."
"This printer arrived with a broken automatic document feeder. I took it apart, reassembled it, and the ADF started working again. Annoying, but fixable if you are comfortable reassembling printer parts. I did notice the scans done via the ADF were sometimes stretched at points, indicating the ATF rollers weren't completely grabbing the paper. Great.Then the firmware wouldn't update. The self test reported the network connection was working, and I could print to the printer via the network, so I knew the network was good. But it wouldn't download the firmware when the printer was connected via ethernet. I had to remove ethernet, switch to Wi-Fi, let the firmware update fail once, before it finally worked the second try on Wi-Fi.Then, the scan to network folder wouldn't work. Frustratingly, there is no error message. The ""scan"" button is just greyed out. Okay, HP gives you a utility in the printer's web interface to verify it can connect to the network folder. This step passes. Scan button is still greyed out. No network scans over ethernet.For kicks, I tried doing a network scan over Wi-Fi. This worked! Maybe this would be alright if the Wi-Fi didn't intermittently reconnect. (the printer boasts that it will automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi. The fact they have to advertise this is suspect... maybe put a better NIC in these printers??)I'm at my wit's end with this printer and I've only had it for 2 hours. A printer shouldn't take this much troubleshooting to get set up. This one is going back to Amazon."
"Amazing product, high quality printing and easy to handle. Once you explore and setup everything, you have an amazing printer that allows you to save money and time. Highly recommended."
"I'm in IT and I have in the past stayed far away from HP, due to the large amount of software needed to install and so many notifications from the printer once installed.  This printer has none of that... I guess HP finally realized these messages were just a nuisance.  The printer was easy to install and setup on our home network.  Followed the instructions on the screen and it was done in a few mins.I only gave 4 out of 5 stars, due to the scan to email function was lacking... SMTP server is needed for this feature to work.  Which you might need a monthly subscription using (Gmail or MailChimp..etc.)  Wish it was built in... but all in all, it's a great printer and worth the money!"
"This is a great multi purpose printer scanner and should last a good long time."
"HP Color Laserjet Pro MFP 3301sdw Wireless All-in-One Color Laser Printer.This replaced an older HP Laserjet.  It took about an hour to unbox and set up for a laptop, IPad and 2 I-Phones.  The laptop took the most time."
"I decided to upgrade to laser last year after my inkjet clogged for the 100th time (once per week for 2 years), and I ran out of maintenance tanks, and there were no maintenance tanks to buy!I got an M283cdw, which worked flawlessly for a year, including long spells without use, and decided to get one for my office too.  But sadly that's been upgraded to MFP3301, which appears not to be as good.  The first unit I got had a hard error every night which required restarting.  The second unit scanner doesn't work - the sensor jams half the time, and the scanner app Scan button blinks but does nothing.  Also it claims (via the built-in webserver accessed via the network) not to be connected most of the time.Both units also complained that paper tray 1 is empty - but since it's a manual sheet feed, that's not surprising -- and the out of paper makes my Mac not want to print unless go to the printed and press OK each time.When it does print, it's fast, clean, and nice looking output."
"Purchased this for a client - setup was easy, the product came well-packaged and was very pretty!  Nice color, looked new.  Everything worked flawlessly!I wish the paper slot were larger, but my client doesn't print much at a time, so she was happy with it.  Thank you for a great refurb product!"
"It works like a charm, I mainly use it to scan but when I first started to print it worked well. Right now, the printing is not great. I'll try to see if changing the ink cartridges fixes the issue."
"Received printer, good condition.  Did not set up for a couple of weeks.  When I did , the printing did not function properly.  a Color print came thru with just a few dots of color on the sheet.  A B/W copy came thru blank.  Tried several different sheets.  Took out each ink cartridge, and cleaned them and re-installed.  The color one functioned okay after this.  the black cartridge still did not perform.  Re-cleaned it and did the water soak suggestion as well.  Still no performance.  Ordered a new 67 black cartridge.  Arrived, I istalled and it printed.  SO  MY CONCLUSION IS THAT A DRIED UP 67 CARTRIDGE WAS SEALED AND SHIPPED WITH THE MACHINE.  I HAD MADE A COMMENT BACK TO AMAZON ON THE NOTICE OF ITEM HAVING BEEN DELIVERED AND WAS IT OKAY? .  BUT NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BACK.  I DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO ORDER OR PAY FOR A ""NEW 67 BLACK CARTRIDGE""  TO REPLACE WHAT WAS SHIPPED"
"I bought this printer for basic printing. i used the thing two different times in the span of a year, printing about 15-20 pages total AT MOST (im being very generous here because i don‚Äôt have exact numbers, but im pretty confident the number is closer to 10 pages)i tried to print one more page after a few months and it wouldn‚Äôt print. i couldn‚Äôt print diagnostic pages because neither the black ink nor the color ink would work. i went through the process of cleaning the cartridges with the options the HP app gave me, i even did a ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù feature they offered me after 3 cleanings in a row didn‚Äôt work. i cleaned the cartridges manually as well and nothing worked. the most i could get out of this machine at that point was very VERY faint light blue in the diagnostic pages, and even then it was too light to make out what had been printed on. i gave up and found the only option i truly had through the insurance i had bought (thank god i bought it too cause it had been over a year since i purchased the printer) was to return it and i gladly did.the only good thing about the printer was the scanning feature, which did fairly well for scanning some images i had wanted digital. still the process of having to use the HP app and be connected to my wifi through the entire process was annoying. good riddance fr"
"Bought this refurbished printer as a gift and the recipient was pleased with the ease of installation and the results. It has proved to be a worthwhile purchase."
"I got a 4150 HP printer that had been refurbished . It was pretty much new looking and worked like a brand new printer and got a good price on it since it was not a brand new printer"
"I was in a pickle and needed a printer FAST. During COVID, all of the printers have been limited supply so I felt I would take a chance on this one. First thing I noticed about this printer when I received it was there were NO instructions. You are instructed to download an app (HP Smart) and configure it all from there, however when I tried, the app wouldn't find any WiFi networks (when I knew there were plenty in my apartment building). THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IF YOU HAVE ISSUES SETTING UP:1. Plug in the printer2. Place ink inside and paper in the feeder3. It will print a page (that I have attached in photos just in case) to help you set up4. Hold down the WiFi button AND the cancel button for 3 seconds until the power button flashes5. Move onto the app to continue configuring - it will ""find"" the printer and then allow you to connect to WiFiThey made this printer unnecessarily complicated to set up but once it is up, it works like a charm and you are even able to change the printer's email address. I tried to set this bad boy up on 4 different attempts and had to walk away 3x because it wouldn't connect to WiFi and I got frustrated. Happy with my purchase now, but I was about to throw it out the window for a second there... Anyways, overall, if you are tech-savvy, I would recommend this printer! I just suggest to the manufacturer that it COMES WITH the instruction sheet rather than making you print it prior to setting it up... that was odd."
"Always bought ink jets for home use and the printer heads would dry out.  Need something to print reports and such at infrequent intervals so wanted something that would last a long time with little maintenance.After almost a year of ownership this thing still chugs along and the quality of print hasn't dimished due to lack of use.  Same color quality and depth.  Highly recommend this if you want something that lasts long and doesn't require a lot of cost to maintain.I also bought back up cartridges for 150 bucks which is a far cry less than what ink cartridges cost."
"11-10-20202020 sucks, but my printer is doing great. Still prints fast. We probably print like a page a day, sometimes we print 10. So that's like 400 pages maybe over the course of a year. I don't get any paper jams, or have any of the problems I had with all the other printers I've had to deal with. I am tech support, so I deal with my companies broken computers and printers all the time.1-3-2020Two and a half months later I still love it. We are probably nowhere near the 1800 pages or whatever number it was before the cartridges run out of ink supposedly. I have avoided updating the firmware hoping that will not be an issue for us. It works great, why would I want to update firmware? Over the last 20 years I have dealt with so many problems from so many HP printers, and this one just works flawlessly.My only complaint is that if I print a color picture the lines are not as crisp or Sharp. They still look okay. We just get our photo pictures printed somewhere if they are important. I have not tried it with photo paper, and do not intend to. We have mostly used it to print pictures to cut out for my kids projects to stick them to poster boards for presentations, and it was more than satisfactory. We have also used it to print Maps for road trips, it was okay, good enough...Bottom line is printer works great, app to print from phone is awesome. It prints from my network, I have not had issues with one computer printing to it (we have several). I would buy again.I have still not been compensated for this great review but would gladly take handouts!10-15-2019 brand new today.Quick review: IT'S BIG! HUGE! 2-3 time larger than my 10 year old HP. 50 pounds! Setup wasn't hard, but could have been easier. Prints look great, prints fast, using only for minimal household use. Printed easily from my Android phone using brother print and scan app. I didn't get anything for this great review."
"Brother HL-L3270CDW Compact Wireless Digital Color Printer with NFC, Mobile Device and Duplex PrintiAt less than $300 this printer is, in my opinion, a bargin.  This printer is ~40 pounds, but the box arrived with barely any damage via USPS (pleasantly surprized).  Print quality for fonts is sharp.  Print quality for pictures and images may not be as well defined and posibly over saturated (I didn't calibrate).  I printed a artist's rendering of a girl meeting a young deer, in a forest, and the face of the deer was dark and lacked definition.  The whole print was over saturated and didn't look that bad, but wasn't true to the picture I had downloaded from deviant art dot com.  I don't think I am allowed to upload the print due to (c).The toner will likely last years based on the fact that I don't print much, but if it were an inkjet I'd need to buy new ink every few months I wanted to print a form, map, evelope, letter, etc... 'cause the inkjet heads would dryout and clog.Duplex printing is a plus!My previous printer was a Brother Inkjet, and I liked the ease of use, and quality.I recommend this printer if you're not using it for photographs, or to print nice pictures, but why would you use a laser printer for that?!I paid full price for this product and received no compensation for the product nor review."
"Been using this printer for a year and a half now. Overall it's a pretty good printer. For normal print jobs it of course prints fine. The colors align precisely, and produces good full color images. The duplex printing is a nice feature and also works fine. I also frequently print on card stock and envelopes, and this is mostly fine. You have to open the front panel and manual feed one sheet at a time, but it sometimes won't grab correctly, and thinks there's a jam, requiring you to open it and close it to make it think you fixed something before it'll try to print again.One issue is the toner cartridges it comes with. The first printer I ordered was leaving yellow marks on every thing it printed. So I bought another. The second printer was leaving red marks on everything it printed. Thankfully I hadn't returned the first yet, so I just took the functional cartridges from one printer, and put the defective cartridges in the returned one. But having 2 out of 2 orders with bad cartridges is a pretty lousy failure rate.So minus one star for the annoying issues with it thinking its jammed when it isn't, and for the bad cartridges."
"I've been using the Brother HLL3270CDW Wireless Color Printer in my home office for several months, and it has proven to be a valuable asset for my day-to-day printing needs.Setup and Connectivity: Setting up the printer was straightforward. The wireless connectivity is a standout feature, allowing me to easily print from multiple devices, including smartphones and tablets, without any hassle. The Brother iPrint&Scan app enhances the ease of use, offering convenient options for printing and scanning.Print Quality: The print quality for both color and black-and-white documents is impressive. The colors are vibrant and consistent, making it suitable for printing graphics and small-scale marketing materials. Text documents are sharp and clear, even with small font sizes.Speed and Efficiency: The print speed is commendable, handling high-volume tasks efficiently. This is a significant advantage for anyone with regular or bulk printing needs. It's not just fast but also relatively quiet compared to other printers I've used.Paper Handling: The paper tray has a good capacity, reducing the need for frequent refills. It handles different paper types and sizes well, which is a plus for a variety of printing tasks.Cost-effectiveness: While the initial cost of the printer is reasonable, the toner cartridges can be a bit pricey. However, the high yield options for toner do offer better long-term value. The printer's energy efficiency also helps in reducing operating costs.Design and Build: The printer has a compact and modern design, fitting well in small office spaces. The build quality is solid, as expected from Brother.Limitations: It's worth noting that it's a single-function printer, so if you need scanning or copying capabilities, you might have to look elsewhere. Also, while the color prints are great for documents and presentations, it might not suffice for professional-quality photo printing.Overall: The Brother HLL3270CDW is a reliable and efficient choice for anyone in need of a color printer for home or small office use. Its ease of use, quality of prints, and speed make it a worthwhile investment, especially if your primary need is document printing."
"I bought this product a few days ago and am very happy with it. Since I use Linux Mint, not every product is suitable. However, this printer works ""out of the box"". There is nothing to install. It just works.In addition, the communication and service were excellent. I am very happy and would like to expressly recommend the product and the company."
"I was impressed with how well this printer was packaged when it was shipped to me. This Brother color laser printer works very well for me and it has some features I did not have in color laser printers in the past. I am very pleased with the purchase of this laser color printer."
"I recently purchased the HP OfficeJet 250 - All-in-One Portable Printer and I have to say, it has made my life so much easier. As someone who is always on-the-go, the ability to print from both my phone and laptop has been a game changer.Setting up the printer was a breeze, thanks to its wireless and mobile printing capabilities. This feature allows me to seamlessly print from my phone or laptop without having to connect any cords or wires. Plus, the printer's compact size makes it extremely portable, making it perfect for travel or taking to meetings.The quality of prints is also impressive. The colors are vibrant and the text is crisp, just like any traditional printer. I am able to print documents, photos, and even scan important files all in one device.One of my favorite features of this printer is its long battery life. I can easily print multiple pages without having to worry about constantly charging it. This has saved me so much time and frustration.Overall, I highly recommend the HP OfficeJet 250 - All-in-One Portable Printer for anyone who needs a reliable and convenient printing solution. It truly lives up to its name as ""Print on the Go."" Amazing product!"
"I don't typically write reviews but was compelled to with this product. It was very easy to set up and prints great. It's the perfect size. 10/10 would buy again."
"Finally, a printer that has enough going for it to be a worthy successor to the legendary HP Si series printers!  I bought this, based on the reviews, to specifically to be able to mobile print from a variety of devices and after 3 months of use, I can say it functions flawlessly!Pros:* Sturdily built - finally a consumer printer that you don't have to fear breaking the flimsy plastic housing if you touch it!  The housing and all external parts are sturdy enough to stand up to normal transport bumps and thumps.* Works with a variety of devices - be sure to have BOTH Bluetooth and WiFi enabled on your computing device (laptop, cell phone, etc) and it will find the printer with no problem.  I have used it extensively with my iPhone 6 airprint and PC laptop WiFi with no issues.* Battery life is great - I go two weeks on a full charge, printing a few sheets per day, and have plenty of battery left.* Color docs look good - I don't print photos on this machine, but the color charts, graphs, and text are clear and sharp.* Works in a wide variety of environments - I've used this printer in near freezing conditions and it just chugs along without a problem.* Copy feature works great - images are sharp and text is clear.  Note that this machine will scan and fax, as well, but I haven't used these features yet.* The price is reasonable for the features and reliability you get.* Reasonably economical on the ink, contrary to most HP inkjets.Con - typically, the HP brand ink is very expensive.Print speed is rather sedate, not as fast as the fastest ink jets, but it's plenty fast enough for mobile use and its reliability and ease of use makes up the difference.  Other reviewers have said this printer could easily be all you need for a home printer, as well as traveling, and I agree.  If you only print occasionally, this machine will meet your needs.After years of being disappointed (disgusted, really) by flimsy, finicky inkjet printers that didn't seem to live much beyond their first set of ink cartridges, I'm sold on this machine.  Hopefully HP will continue this trend (and reclaim their soiled legacy) by extending this effort to their other product lines.Note - if you only need to print is B&W, then check out the OfficeJet 200, which is about 20% cheaper at this writing."
"I love this printer. I 1st bought it to print shipping labels and an occasional bill,  however I have come to love it,  and kept it for use in my small office. We do have a bigger printer in the reception office I can print to if I have a very large print job.  I have used it in the car and in the hotel, but mostly it stays in my small office. It is very convenient and can be easily moved to another room if doing a something that requires printing somewhere besides office. If you need a small printer at your house for occasional printing or school work, but don't want they eyesore of a big printer,  this is for you! It can even be stored in a drawer or cupboard,  and taken out for use, then stored againPros:1.Very small - fits nicely in my small office.  (I bought an insulated 9X13 cake pan carrier to put it in when traveling)2.Can print from phone as well as computer3.Battery if no electricity available4.Good print quality5.Fairly fast - not as quick as our main office printer,  but definately faster than other printers I've had6. Quiet7. Can make copies8. Prints 2-sided (extra step required)Cons:1. Nothing to catch papers after they print (this is the ONLY thing about the design that I really wish was changed.2. Occassionally my phone thinks the printer isn't available when indeed it is.I have never used the scan feature,  so I cannot comment on that."
"Nice and compact .quite heavy for its size but does everything I need it to do .easy to set up and use .very happy and would definitely recommend"
"We live in a small condo, so can’t have a larger printer just taking up space. This small printer is solidly built, meant to be stowed to be on the road (I sprung for a carrying case - it cost just over a hundred, but also really well made), and it works really well in such small living quarters. Just printed up everything I needed for my corporate taxes, and everything printed up really well! A couple weeks ago I scanned in a tax document, got it sent to my email, pdf’d all nice and neat... I’m really enjoying this handy thing. I have not printed any photos, but for printing documents and scanning, this has done really well. This printer has only been with us for a month, so I may come back to update, but so far, it’s a great product."
"This camera has exceeded every expectation that I had.  Images are razor sharp, autofocus is amazingly fast, the battery life is beyond anything in my experience, and it is a perfect size for my needs.Having owned Yashicas, Rollei, Lumix, Fujifilm and many others...I would definitely buy a Sony again.  What an amazing camera and the kit lens is sharp, even in low light."
"I'm not a professional photographer, but I wanted a good quality camera to take better pictures without lugging around a bulky DSLR full frame. This camera fit the bill. I chose it over the 6400 because I wanted the IBIS image stabilization and the ability to run with a bigger battery with more capacity. I paired it with a set of Sigma (30mm & 56mm) prime lenses that can get down f1.4. The quality of the image capture is insane! I work for some big name studios and did a fair bit of research before deciding on this camera because I also wanted to use it for video conferencing and streaming as well.Some pro photographers scoff at mirrorless cameras or APS-C format sensors. I get it. If you're doing this for a living, you need full frame. But even as a backup camera, or for vlogging, this camera is on par with anything Cannon puts out. Sony is known for their slog color profiles and I can't wait to try color grading some footage shot with it. I paired it with the Magewell HDMI capture card for video streaming/chatting and it works very well. I have it set to not turn off after 30 minutes so I can video chat for hours without worry of the camera automatically turning off.I won't go into all the possible settings in the camera. There's plenty of videos on YouTube that discuss all the features in detail. All I'll say is if you're doing research and getting into more serious photography, or if you're a pro photographer looking for a run and gun type camera or a backup to save you in a crunch, you could do far worse than this camera, but in the form factor you'd be hard pressed to do better."
"OK, so it ain't cheap but the results are amazing. I have a m43 outfit as well which is ALMOST as good. Almost. When I want quick and accurate AF the a6600 is the champ. Image quality superb. I have a lot of difficulty seeing a difference with full frame images, and when you consider the cost, size and weight of full frame cameras & lenses, the a6600 is a no-brainer.Very pleased with this purchase!!"
"I have been using a Canon G9x, Canon G7x ii, and T3i (mostly with 17-50mm 2.8, 70-250mm, 50mm 1.4).  I used the t3i for pictures of my kids (sports, portraits, etc).  I really needed faster burst shooting and better focus for track meets.  I wanted to stay with Canon (just because that is what I'm familiar with), but I wasn't happy with EF-M options (bodies and lenses).  I didn't want to go full frame (f2.8 lenses $$$).  I decided I wanted to go mirrorless, and I couldn't wait for some rumored Canon APS-C mirrorless.So, I ended up going with A6600 + Tamron 17-70 2.8 + Tamron 70-180mm 2.8 + sigma adapter for 50mm 1.4.  I'm very happy.  The fast burst speed is great.  A bigger buffer would be nice, but not a big deal for me. The focus is everything I was hoping it would be.  I love the eye focus.  I love the subject tracking.  I love that there are so many focus options (area size, position, tracking, flex, etc).I'm also very happy with the size of the 2 lenses.  Some people, complain that the touch screen can't be used for the menu.  That doesn't bother me at all.  I prefer buttons. I don't use the touch screen for menus on my Canon G7X.  I prefer the ergonomics of my T3i.  I miss the front dial, but I'm quickly getting used to the top/rear dials.I first ordered the a6400, but the grip just felt too small for the 70-180 lens, so I didn't use it at all.  I put it right back in the box and ordered the a6600.  I'm much happier with the bigger grip.  I like the bigger battery. The extra custom buttons and the IBIS are a nice bonus."
"I bought this after spending a long time researching different Sony cameras. I used to swear by Canon and have a lot of handheld documentary-style and interview filmmaking under my belt as well as social media content creation. I have filmed using an A7Siii in a studio environment and that was the main alternative to this that I was considering. I also looked at the older a6500 as a slightly cheaper alternative. Here's what sold me: - the flip-up touchscreen; - slightly improved processing and body construction; - better ISO sensitivity.I found a deal (separately) on the Carl Zeiss f/4 16-70mm lens and the image quality is staggering on both photo and video. I do mostly documentary-style interviews, vlogging / informational videos, and webinars. I found a simple converter for less than $100 that makes it simple to use this as a 1080p beautiful webcam.This camera is a joy to use. If you use it for long periods of time (as I do in a studio setting), consider finding a dummy A/C power battery to prevent overheating (a very common Sony issue for any shoots longer than ~45min).Sony's autofocus and color settings are simply the best. It would be nice to have dual SD card slots, but that's really the only thing I miss when I consider the much more expensive a7siii."
"Excellent product. Video and photo are both incredible for it"
"I am using this camera for my tv production. Great image. Love the battery life."
"Happy with the purchase. Easy to use, solid and fancy."
"I'm more pragmatic than many others. I only want a great Low Light performance in a camera, features such as 4K at 60P, 15FPS, film simulations, more battery life are nothing to me.Battery life on A7III is more than I expected, video capabilities also are great.Better than competition in variety of things: 15 dynamic range stops! Amazing low light ISO performance, IBIS, astonishing and fast AF, great variety of glasses, DxOmark calls A7III the Low Light Performer, this sensor is over 1 point above than Z6 and over 10 than EOS R. The dual SD slots are very satisfying.Resume: A7III is the WORLD'S BEST CAMERA UNDER 2K $"
"Still one of the best under $2k cameras you can buy currently. Despite being 3 years old, I love it and it is amazing for low light. It films very well, amazing 4k."
"I am sure you've already heard about how great this camera is. Let me tell you how great this vendor was with amazon. They got it to me early and in perfect condition. Great work!"
"I went from a Nikon D90 to this camera and am very happy with the improvement in image quality, focusing speed and accuracy, as well as frame rate.  The fact that it takes 4k video is also a huge improvement over the 720 video of the D90.  Being able to work in lower-light environments is why I wanted to go full-frame and having the convenience and small size of mirror-less is definitely the future now."
"Truly a superb instrument. Camera has so many excellent features. The included bundle is a great addition."
"I did it. I bought this bad boy. Most of the stuff in the kit you won’t use, but the lens is pretty damn good and the camera is amazing! Taking it to Tokyo tomorrow!"
"I bought it through adroma on amazon. This camera was $1900 the day before and at the day I bought it they increase the price by $300, which made this camera not as great value as before.The image quality is undoubtedly great at its price range. However, the accessories come with the camera are not very good as expected. Especially the SD card reader was already broken when I opened the package. Since I have got an old one that works great, I decided not to return and exchange."
"The camera is everything I dreamed of and more. The card reader deaf came in handy sense my laptop wouldn’t read the care without it. The battery has incredible life. I haven’t really used much of the the other stuff."
"The Sony Alpha a6400 is an exceptional camera for both enthusiasts and professionals. Its impressive autofocus system is quick and accurate, ensuring you never miss a moment. The 24.2 MP sensor captures stunning images with vibrant colors and crisp details. The compact design makes it easy to carry, and the 180-degree flip screen is perfect for vlogging. Battery life is solid, allowing for extended shooting sessions. Overall, this camera is a fantastic !have for few years now"
"Wanting to leave my more expensive gear at home for a recent cruise to Alaska I picked up the 6400 with the kit 16-50mm lens. While I’ve heard lots of praise for the 6400 the kit lens is often dismissed, but in my experience it was well above its price point. The image quality was crisp and colorful. I was so impressed that I usually left my bulky expensive lens in my cabin. Equally impressive was the ClearZoom function - absolutely usable up to 1.6x with no discernible quality loss for standard jpeg images.Battery life was also much better than my A7Rii but far short of my Canon cameras. 2 batteries basically lasted for a full day of constant shooting.Even in 2024 this is absolutely a great setup and incredibly compact and lightweight. It’ll be my summer travel camera with zero reservations.For the money it’s an incredible value and from my experience the kit lens is no slouch. Focusing was fast and spot on."
"Battery life was not as bad as i have heard in the past. Its pretty decent. It is a little heavy with a lens on it so i got a strap. So worth the money! The quality of the images is top tier!"
"Exceptional camera. Menu system not as bad as reviews said. Does not get hot at all after a 2.5hr non-stop video at 1080p using dummy battery. Does get quite warm, in a 72deg room, when recording at 4k, but not hot. Internal mics are mediocre, but added shotgun mic and audio is excellent. This is the water-resistant AL-magnesium version, a step up from a6100; worth added expense for magnesium housing and water resistance for protection on a rainy day. Bought with 19-135 lens, pics are excellent.  Only flaw is why the camera cannot output h.264 video over USB or the WiFi? Instead have to buy a hokey (price gouged) HDMI ""capture"" card; HDMI is already digital. Sony has h.264 compression in the a6400. It is used on videos recorded to the SD card. The new a7 will have h.265 lossless compression; too bad they were not on the ball and did not put this in the a6400.  h.264 compression is several years old!UPDATE: After a year and a half, all I can say is fantastic! I am nearsighted and the red focus assist negates the need to wear glasses or use the viewfinder's built-in diopter adjuster. I use this cam with a Laowa 9mm rectilinear lens (manual focus) for indoor pics, and the articulated screen is great for this. It allows the camera to work like a Hassalblad; holding the camera low to get the angle right (so vertical lines are parallel). One can hold the camera at waist height and tilt the screen up. With the 35-135 kit zoom, the auto-focus is excellent. With the SEL200600G, works great, but the big zoom does use up the battery, so keep a spare. Another wow factor is the digital-zoom-in-while-focusing (C1 button in still pic mode). This allows viewing the image zoomed in to get the focus perfect. Water rest mag case is the way to go too. I never worry about being out in the rain with this camera (but I do make an effort to not let it get wet anyway to be safe). probably have shot several THOUSAND pics and all I can say is ""wish I had this camera thirty years ago"". Thanks Sony!"
"I like that this line of mirrorless cameras is lightweight and is relatively compact compared to a digital DLR. As with many of the newer digital cameras the 6400 shoots beautiful video and I am especially happy with it having a stereo mini input that would allow use of high end microphones.  The camera is light years ahead of the bulky cameras I used to use on commercial field shoots. Aspiring videographers don't know how lucky they are to have tools like this at their disposal at such a low cost. Not only is the video stellar, the stills are too. I love the continuous shooting mode when shooting wildlife.  Sony has a great lineup of lenses to pair with the camera and other lens manufacturers are developing lenses for the Sony E Mount cameras as well."
"Love it. I bought another one when my first one got damaged recently, even though it’s a few years old as of 2024,  lightweight and pretty small but packs a punch.  Easy to learn the functions and buttons. It’s not full frame, of course, but doesn’t have that FF price tag either.  Highly recommend for a first time camera.  Good for experienced too."
"I have a Sony A7RV full frame, with that in mind this camera does the job very well. I shoot portraits, venues and passport photos and this APSC can do all those just fine.Post production workflow is much quicker given there is less megabytes to process (from a 61 megapixel full frame to a 24 megapixel APSC). So it's a dream in that regard.A lot is said about the small size and portability about this camera. I have the Sigma 30mm 1.4 to go with this, and yes, the small size and portability is great.This camera doesn't have all the bells and whistles that my A7RV has, but that's not impeding my work flow by any means.If you're on the fence, just get it. Affordable, compact, great autofocus and actually has a faster burst rate than my A7RV."

Sony is first and foremost a technology company, and they are doing things with the A7 series that are currently unequaled. This camera is unique in the marketplace. As of this writing, there's literally nothing else like it from Sony's direct competitors Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Olympus, Fuji, & Pentax. If you want a full frame mirrorless cam (and don't want to trade your car for a Leica), you're getting an A7. The only question is which A7.(NOTE: For more detailed photos and video, check out the A7ii review on my website [...]-- also do a search for ""Loloho Photo YouTube"" to find my VIDEO channel with lots of photo great reviews!)The original A7 was named ""camera of the year"" for cramming a 24MP full frame sensor into a compact mirrorless body. How does Sony top it with the A7ii? By improving ergonomics, focus speed, video capabilities, and delivering a groundbreaking IN BODY image stabilization system - the world's first 5-Axis stabilized full frame sensor. This illustrates a couple of admirable characteristics about Sony's imaging division - they listen to customers, and they relentlessly innovate. When Sony updates a camera (which they do often), they deliver significant design changes that translate to real world improvement - not just megapixel boosts.A note about lenses: the lens situation is improving. At the time of this writing, the best native prime lenses for the A7ii are the brilliant Zeiss 55 f1.8 and the Zeiss 35. I've heard the Zeiss 16-35 is outstanding but have not tried it yet. At Photokina Sony announced a number of new E-mount lenses that are expected to hit the market in 2015. I feel the sub-100mm range will soon be pretty well covered, especially once these new lenses hit the market. Of course with an inexpensive adapter, you can use just about any lens you please with an A7, and that's what makes these cameras so wonderful.I bought my A7ii here on Amazon and got it the first day of release. In this review, I'm going to assume you know the basics about the A7 series, and go straight to the pros and cons of the new camera. For more files and video about the camera, check out my site. [...]PROS*In Body Steadyshot - This is the marquee feature and for good reason. Now ALL of your lenses have image stabilization - including those 40-year old Nikkors and Leicas. It's amazing and it works. Of course the stabilization is more helpful with lenses towards the telephoto end of the spectrum. I've tried it with my 105mm and 300mm Nikkor primes with impressive results. With native E-mount lenses that deliver focus distance information, you get full 5-Axis stabilization. If there's no electronic communication with the camera to transmit focus distance (as with older legacy lenses) you get 3-Axis stabilization. Note that for legacy lenses, you'll want to manually specify the focal length to ensure the best results. And yes, Steadyshot works a treat for handheld video too. Shortly after the A7ii hit the market, Sony released a firmware update (version 1.1) that improved the in camera Steadyshot and squashed an annoying bug - if you get an A7ii, MAKE CERTAIN that you are running the latest firmware!*Shutter release - The shutter release has been moved forward on the camera body to a more natural location. It's now right where your finger expects it to be. Alas, it's flat across the top like most DSLRs, so there's no possibility of a cable or soft shutter release.*Better Grip - The new hand grip is thicker and easier for my hand to grasp. The new grip extends about 10mm further from the body. The new grip contributes to the apparent size increase in the A7ii.*Improved Autofocus - Sony is claiming 30% better autofocus performance. While many were hoping for AF as fast as the a6000, unfortunately it's not there yet. But Sony has improved the focusing algorithms to elicit noticeably better performance. I've had good success with facial recognition, eye focus, and object tracking. A7ii autofocus is good; I have no major complaints, but it's not as fast as a DSLR or the a6000 (a camera I also own and enjoy).*Build quality - More magnesium is now used in the camera body, and it's obvious. The camera feels solid and reassuring in the hands, like it's been carved out of metal. Even the buttons and control dials add to the premium feel of the camera.*Video  - The A7ii has several notable video improvements. High quality 50 Mbps XAVC S codec is now included. Built in stabilization is a HUGE help with nonstabilized lenses. Now ALL your fast primes are stabilized for video! And the camera includes a S-LOG picture profile with enhanced dynamic range that's useful for color grading.*Wifi - This is not a new feature, but Sony has done a nice job integrating wifi into the camera. The wifi integration really showcase Sony's prowess as a tech company (Nikon and Canon have badly lagged behind in this department, IMHO). We are already taking this stuff for granted, but it's really kind of incredible to remotely control your camera from your tablet or phone -- with a live image view, no less. If you want to quickly share photos from your full frame camera to social media, it's been made easy for you, no clunky adapters required. Sony needs to do a better job highlighting these features, because they are great.*Alpha menus - Sony has now standardized the Alpha menu system across several different camera bodies. It's a clean, logical user interface that works well. With a little practice, it's remarkably easy to access the features you need quickly. The upshot? You spend less time ""menu diving"" and more time taking photos.*EVF - The A7ii electronic viewfinder is essentially the same as the A7, but it should be noted that it's great. The EVF is what allows Sony to squeeze down the body size of the A7 series. Once you get used to having focus assist and peaking (and the results of your shot) available inside the EVF, you will love it. What once seemed like a drawback of mirrorless cameras is now a huge advantage.*Metal lens mount - The A7ii lens mount is more robust than that of the first gen cameras. No wiggle! Lenses mount nice and tight to the body.*More customizable buttons - There are now four customizable ""C"" buttons to which you can assign your favorite functions, like eye autofocus, focus assist, white balance.*Articulating LCD screen - The articulating LCD screen merits a mention because so many DSLRs still do not include the feature. Once you've shot with an articulating screen, you don;t want to go without one. The LCD screen provides a decent range of motion for high and low angle shots.*Startup time - Startup time of the camera has been improved, which means fewer missed shots.*Matte finish - This is a matter of taste, but I like the matte finish of the A7ii.CONS*Weight - Weight has increased over the original A7 by 146 grams or 5.15 ounces to 599 grams. This is no small increase (a 26% gain over the A7, to be precise). When packing camera gear, every ounce matters. If it gets much heavier, we're losing a key advantage of mirrorless. Yet to be fair, at 599 grams the A7ii is still lighter than the Nikon Df (760g), Canon 6D (760g), Canon 5D Mark III (950g) and Nikon D800 (980g). Of course none of those competing cameras offer in body image stabilization, or many of the other features of the A7ii. So the A7ii remains lighter than the competition while offering a uniquely powerful functionality. If the added weight is a deal killer for you, there's always the original A7. Personally, I decided that the extra features are worth the cost in weight.*Girth- The A7ii body is not quite as svelte as the original A7. Thickness of the body itself has increased by a couple of mm. It seems more pronounced because the new grip extends a good 10mm further than the old. The A7ii is (dare I say it?) a bit chunky. The body has become more like a blend of mirrorless and DSLR. I suspect that the average non-photographer would glance at this camera and assume it is a small DSLR. Note that for some people this minus will actually be a plus. Why? Because the camera handles larger/heavier lenses with better ergonomics.*Small control wheels - This is a nitpick, but the fore and aft control wheels are small and almost flush with the body. A larger size would provide better tactile feel.*No 4k video - Not a major omission to me, but the lack of 4k is a disappointment. I think it would have been easy for Sony to include 4k, but the marketing department must have other plans. If you must have 4k, you want the A7S.*No silent shutter - The shutter noise is improved over the original A7, but it's not the dead silent shutter of the A7S.*Antialiasing filter - The A7ii has a low pass filter. I'd prefer they omit it.*Poor Apps Implementation - The original idea of offering apps is a good one, but unfortunately the PlayMemories apps have been poorly implemented by Sony. The PlayMemories store has a few worthwhile offerings, but as of this writing one of the best (time lapse) isn't compatible with the A7ii. Sony needs to open up the app store to allow outside development to make the most of this functionality. (Imagine how lame iTunes or Android would be if Apple/Google provided all the apps! That's what we're getting now from Sony.) Please, Sony - either do a better job with the PlayMemories app store, or just go ahead and include the app features in our cameras from day one.*Battery charger not included - Battery life is not a strength of these cameras (rated at 350 shots per charge) so you will want extra batteries. If you want an external battery charger, you've got to buy your own. I have several batteries and prefer to charge the extras while still having my camera free to use.*Questionable flash options - There's no onboard flash, and Sony's flash offerings are disappointing. No sync speed higher than 1/250. I don't often do flash photography, but there are times when it is necessary. Personally I would appreciate an onboard bounceable flash like that of the a6000 (the a6000 flash works great in this respect) or even a small fill flash like the X100 series.CONCLUSIONWhether you want an A7ii really boils down to two words : STEADYSHOT INSIDE. With the A7ii, it's all about image stabilization. The in body stabilization is actually a big deal. That's why you pay the premium for this camera over a first generation body. If you shoot with lenses that lack OSS (and that includes all legacy lenses) then it makes sense to get the A7ii. It's like getting a nice across-the-board upgrade to your lens collection. It's extremely cool to attach a 40-year old Nikkor 105mm and enjoy the benefits of stabilization. I have a host of Nikkors and some unstabilized E-mount (including the superb Zeiss FE55) that benefit.Of course the ergonomic improvements of the A7ii are welcome. I'm sure that many professionals will upgrade to the A7ii simply for the relocated shutter release button and improved grip.The 24MP sensor of the A7ii is basically the same as that used in the A7. If you want a high resolution mirrorless monster, you want the A7R.If you are heavily interested in VIDEO, your decision may come down to the A7ii versus the A7S. You might think of it this way: the A7S is a video camera that takes stills, while the A7ii is a stills camera that takes great video. While ""steadyshot inside"" certainly helps with handheld shooting of video on the A7ii, lowlight performance trails the A7S. If you must have the King of Lowlight Video, you still want the A7S.Because I shoot both video and stills I debated between the A7ii and the A7S. It was a difficult choice, but I ultimately decided that the superlative all around performance of the A7ii was best for me.I have owned (and in some cases still own) cameras from Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Fuji, and Olympus. At the moment there's literally not an apples-for-apples competitor to this Sony camera. I buy the camera that is the best for my needs and am not loyal to one brand. Lately it seems that SONY is the company that's delivering innovation and excitement in this space. While Nikon and Canon have gingerly tested the waters of mirrorless camera design (no doubt to protect their existing DSLR product lines), Sony has been fearlessly pushing ahead with groundbreaking technology. Sony makes the sensors, and is hungry for market share; we photographers are reaping the benefits.Today, I find the A7ii the best general purpose full frame camera on the market. It's compact, solidly built but not too heavy, plays nice with a huge number of lenses, and is packed full of AMAZING technology. It just does everything (stills and video) very well. And by the way, the price is quite reasonable considering all it delivers. It's one of the most affordable full frame cameras you can buy. If you purchase one, I think you will enjoy it."
"This is a fantastic camera and I've been through plenty of cameras. This is the one I'll be keeping. A little history... My first DSLR (9ish years ago) was a Nikon D40. I quickly outgrew that and bought a D90. After I while I wanted more. I got myself a D700 and that was a fantastic camera.  At some point I got sick of the weight of heavy cameras and lenses. I sold all of my Nikon gear and bought a Sony Nex7. I loved the light weight...but I was never happy with the image quality. Sooo...back to Nikon. Bought a D7100 and a bunch of lenses. I took a trip to Italy and midway through the trip decided that I needed to look at other options. Once again I was sick of carrying around all that weight. I planned to sell my Nikon stuff (again) and look back at the mirrorless options. I never got the chance because my camera bag was stolen on the way to Milan. Once I got home I started investigating my options. I tried an Olympus E-M1 but that didn't suit me. It's a nice camera but just wasn't up to the standard in image quality that I was used to. Next, I tried the Fuji X-T1. That is a beautiful machine. I would've been happy with it...If I hadn't also tried out the Sony a7. I was happier with the image quality from the Sony, but happier with the feel of the Fuji camera. In the end, image quality won and I kept the Sony. For my type of photography (landscapes, portraits) the Sony fit me very well. The autofocus was acceptable, but not great. But with my kind of work this isn't that big a deal. But I was never happy with the quality of the actual camera body. Just felt a little cheap. Then the a7ii was announced and I decided to trade up. While the camera is a bit heavier, the trade off of AMAZING handling makes it well worth it. The camera oozes quality and feels much nicer to hold than any other mirrorless camera I have tried. The in-body image stabilization is also great. I can handhold with the 55 1.8 at 1/4 second pretty consistently. I can get good images slower that that too, but they are more hit-or-miss. Still, the fact that I CAN get clear images at 1 second is insane. Autofocus is also noticeably better than on the a7. It's not in the same league as a Nikon DSLR like my old D7100, but for me that's not a big deal. If I were shooting sports then the Sony would be out...simple as that.For me, this is pretty much the perfect camera. I'm using it with the FE 55mm f1.8 and FE 16-35mm f4. I also have a Rokinon 85mm f1.4 (replaced my Nikon 85 1.4G that was stolen) and I just ordered a Canon FD 135mm f2.0 for portraits.  That pretty much covers all my needs. Very very happy with this camera.Oh, I also got a Nissin i40 flash for Christmas and it is a great match with this camera when you need it. It's remarkably powerful for its size and doesn't look ridiculous on the a7ii."
"It may not be the newest fancy model, but the colour quality is great. The camera boots up quickly and focusses quickly as well even in fairly low light. Also by using adapters, I can use 35mm full frame glass and APS-c smaller frame lens I have collected over the years. The 5 axis stabilization works perfectly with current Sony E-mount lenses and 3 axis (more basic) is the default stability for all other glass including everything from screw mount 50 year old glass to Minolta 20 year old glass with AF. Great addition to my kit."
"Sony has very nice cameras; this model, I think, is a good deal for photographers, not videographers... I wasn't sure that I want to switch from Nikon, but I like the concept of using same lenses for a6000 series and A7 series :-)"
"This article is very well done. It is robust and of high quality."
"Still learning how to use all the options. I was able to buy some old glass lenses for about $30 (28mm, 50mm) and take some outstanding portraits and landscapes. Very versatile."
"Excellent camera, I’ve really grown to love it. Keep in mind the battery life isn’t the best I would suggest a battery grip for anyone that is more then occasional shooter."
"This drone is incredible. bought it as a birthday gift to myself, i've been using it for 8 months now and it has been flawless. small learning curve to get going for the first flight, but after the first time or two flying it takes only a minute to go from bag to flying in the air.the battery life is phenomenal, i typically only charge one or two batteries when i go to fly the drone, i never end up flying long enough to use all three batteries. the range isn't quite as good as advertised unless you're on a mountain and have clear line of sight between the controller and drone, but i've found i can still get up to a mile on average in the places i go (trees, buildings) before losing signal.this drone is impressively stable in the wind. i have flown it in some pretty strong wind gusts and even while in the process of landing it will correct for even a strong wind gust, i'm just blown away at how stable this drone is in the wind. i have flown it in the wind with other people around and they cannot believe how stable it is either. after showing my dad this drone once, my mom bought him one as an anniversary gift.the smart controller is 1,000% worth the money. I don't have to worry about attaching my phone to the controller or forcing my screen brightness up to max in the daylight, or my phone battery dying, or not being able to text while i'm flying (haha). With the smart controller I can ALWAYS see the screen clearly and easily, other people have been blown away by the clarity and stability of the video. Since i don't need my phone attached to the controller I can take pictures or record video of the drone from my phone while flying. I highly highly recommend getting the smart controllerthis makes flying pretty easy. i have only ever flown outside, but in 8 months of flying so far i haven't even had to replace a single propeller blade. this thing just works and works easily and amazingly. i love that it's small enough to take with me on day hikes or to put in my motorcycle bag to take up north"
"I am amazed by how far drone technology has come in the past few years.  This dji drone is a capable and well built tool that has exceeded my expectations.Pros:Decent 4k video and stabilization.  Not quite as good as an iPhone 12 or GoPro but pretty good.Very easy to use with the smart controller.  The smart controller provides a very nice and intuitive experience.Feature rich and very nice drone effects.  The quickshots are awesome and only take seconds.Good battery life and stable even in moderate winds (tested to ~15mph)Solid and well built!  Very impressed with the build quality.  This is not a toy.The drone performance is optimized for video and battery life, not speed or maneuverability.Cons:Tracking of anything but people or cars, is not great. Quickshots will often fail if tracking fails.Haven't had great luck with active track either but haven't used some of the more advanced features.It would be great if they had some gps or ir tags for difficult to track objectsHand takeoff and grabbing the drone out of the air would be nice.  Landing not very useful when in a kayak...Aside from issues with optical tracking, this drone has exceeded all my expectations. This has become my go to videography tool.  Small enough to take nearly anywhere with confidence inspiring flight performance. The fly more package is a nice addition that gives roughly 1.5 hours of flight."
"Amazon told me to review ""thickness, easy to learn, for beginners"". That's a weird combination of things, but here we go:Nah.So this is a good drone for moderate skill levels. It's pretty fast, has a very long battery life, and takes fantastic images. I've been using drones since the Spark came out, about 4 or 5 years years now. I've flown a Phantom 3, Spark, Mavic Air, and now this. I've also flown FPV drones for a few years.Pro:- large propeller, ""heavy"" drone makes handling wind better- good sensor- digital megapixel rendering- smart modes for easier video shots- long battery life- computer assisted takeoff and landingCon:- too smart for its own good (similar with most DJI drones, let the operator operate)- can be hard to learn for a beginner- expensive to learn on- sensor not the best for low light (make up for this by using Smart Photo or AEB)I use this for taking artsy photos. I would use this for real estate too if anybody would hire me. You can't really attach LIDAR or anything to this drone so surveying wouldn't be an ideal use. I mostly enjoy that I can be in the air for 20-30 minutes at a time."
"While it is not cheap if you get the smart controller, it is a high quality drone and the Smart controller is easy to use and simplifies everything and the start up times are greatly reduced by not having to hook up a phone and starting an app. The camera is excellent and the filters are good for shooting in different lighting conditions. I'm still learning all about the Air 2, having flown a Mavic Mini helped a lot.  If you can afford the Smart controller, get it."
"I found it hard to start up, once i got it flying i liked how stable it remained and the resolution was very good. you will not find much youtube orientation for the smart controller. but it's out there, look for it. It helped a lot for beginners like me."
"Upgraded from the original Mavic Air and immediately noticed a difference. Yes, it’s a little bigger but it’s also built better and sturdier. Definitely recommend getting the smart controller as you don’t need to attach a phone and it’s just so much more intuitive and let’s you save to internal memory.Photo quality is awesome and the clarity is worth the upgrade."
"I purchased this drone.  Upon opening it it was obvious someone else had flown it.  I attempted to complete the IMU calibration, however, whenever it completed it would simply cause an error.  I did a couple hours of research and came to the following conclusions:  1) Drone was in a crash or 2) Drone has been in an upright position for such an extended period of time that the IMU has gone faulty and needs to be replaced.Either way, clearly not happy with the product provided to me and have started a return.  Since it was a discounted warehouse deal a replacement would not be issued.  Just writing this review to hopefully safe the next person from the same outcome I got."
"Love drone and the dji product. However if looking to purchase this from amazon I strongly recommend you do not. I purchased this and it arrived defective and not working. Amazing was going to credit me 20% but backed out in there word. They won’t do anything for me!!If you go to purchase anything expensive I recommend you purchase it from the actual site, and not Amazon.Very disappointed in the customer service and satisfaction from the Amazon team."
"My husband got this unit to go with his DJI Pro 4.  He immediately noticed the sharpness on the screen and the clearness of the pictures.  It worked from the very beginning and continues to do a great job!  This is  our second one as the first had an issue, but they had us send it right back and we had a replacement within three days --and even over a weekend!  Great service and an even better unit and experience!"
"Extremely easy to use display is amazing . So much lighter than one using a cell phone.More controller options . What more can I say. Very happy with purchase. Would buy again."
"Works really well with my new NEO Drone, warms up pretty fast."
"It great product for great drones. Hopefully hopefully the drone ban issue will be resolved as DJI makes the best drones and remotes for them."
"So advanced and intuitive in every way."
"If you own a DJI Neo, you’ve got to get the RC2 or one of the other compatible DJI controllers. The little $200 drone is super charged by the capability of this thing. Highly recommend! 10/10"
"I bought this controller to replace the controller that came with my DJI mini 4 pro drone. My phone is in a case and it won't fit well in the controller unless I take my phone out of the case. This controller has the built in screen which solves that problem. The screen is bright enough to see on bright sunny days, although a shade makes it easier to see. I had no problem connecting it to my already paired drone."
"My previous RC Controller is incompatible with my new Mavic Air 3S so I had to get the RC2 which works great."
"Amazing quality for Neo Drone."
"seems quite robust nice screen good feel to control sticks"
"Don't be fooled by other similar products on Amazon. They are priced about the same but aren't authentic DJI products. This one is. Make sure it's sold by Amazon. Expect ~25-35 minutes in real world conditions depending on how windy it is. They advertise 46 min max flight time but that is in perfect windless conditions without recording before dropping dead out of the sky 0 percent. Know what to expect so you won't be disappointed."
"100% The real deal OEM DJI NIB AIR 3 Battery!"
"Liked everything except the batteries going low"
"This is an OEM DJI battery for the Air 3. Of course it comes with the quality I expect from DJI products, however it is overpriced in my opinion. That said, the battery for any DJI drone isn't something you want to cheap out on.As far as battery life, I usually get about 30-40 minutes out of a single charge, though this can vary wildly depending on environmental conditions and what you're doing with the drone. DJI advertises 46 minutes for this battery but that's pretty much the best case scenario under optimal conditions. Most of the time you'll probably get around 30-35 minutes.Again, this is an OEM battery from DJI and I would definitely recommend this over any 3rd party battery. I'm giving this battery 4 stars, I only knocked one off due to the price."
"I'm very satisfied with this product, work perfectly right out of the box, unlike the mavic 3 pro battery. Highly recommended."
"First they shipped me a defective Air 3 battery. I returned it and asked for another one. Then they ship me a battery for a Mini 4 Pro.  I went to send that back, and they won't replace it and are telling me it will take up to 30 days for me to get my money back. It took like 3 seconds for them to take my money. Why does it take 30 days to get it back? I just want a freaking battery for my Air 3. How hard can it be?"
"Exactly what you claimed it was thank you"
"Whats the say? It's literally just a factory DJI battery, the same as all the others. Not different, better, or worse. Overpriced, though. These things are way more expensive than they should be, especially with how they last, both in duration and total life. With heavy use, they DO need replaced, and give about 30 to 35 min of flight time. Expect about 25-30 min, because you won't be running it to complete 0%. Most of the time you'll be ending the flight around 10-15% battery."
"Purchased this charging hub to charge the batteries on my Specta Air drone. Although the drone is not ""DJI"" and the batteries are not interchangeable between the DJI Air 3 and the Specta Air, this charging hub charges the batteries without any issues. I use an Amazon Basics 65w wall charger and USB-C cable and two batteries charger in about 2 hours (1 hour each)."
"The charger works as stated and a MUST have"
"Don’t know why I didn’t get a power supply or power cord so it was perfectly useless"
"I had a little trouble getting it to work at first then got it figured out and it works great"
"I’ve been using the DJI Air 3 Battery Charging Hub, and it has significantly improved my workflow by keeping my drone batteries charged and ready to go. This hub allows me to charge up to three batteries sequentially, which is incredibly convenient when I’m out for a full day of shooting. Here’s what I like and where I see room for improvement:Pros: 1. Sequential Charging Efficiency: The hub charges batteries one at a time, prioritizing the one with the most charge, so I can get back in the air as quickly as possible with a fresh battery. This feature really helps when time is of the essence. 2. Compact and Portable Design: The hub is lightweight and easy to carry, making it a breeze to pack with my drone gear. It doesn’t take up much space, which is ideal for travel. 3. LED Indicators: Each battery slot has an LED indicator to show charging status, so I always know which batteries are ready. This clear display makes it easy to track progress at a glance.Room for Improvement: 1. Simultaneous Charging Option: While sequential charging is efficient, an option to charge all batteries simultaneously would be helpful for situations where I have access to a power source for a limited time. 2. Longer Power Cable: The included power cable is a bit short, which can limit placement options. A slightly longer cable would provide more flexibility, especially when working in outdoor settings with limited outlets. 3. Improved Cooling: The hub tends to get warm during extended charging sessions. Enhanced ventilation or a small fan could improve heat dissipation and ensure a longer lifespan.Overall, the DJI Air 3 Battery Charging Hub is a reliable and effective tool for keeping my batteries ready and maximizing my flight time. With a few minor upgrades, this could easily be the best charging hub for DJI Air 3 owners. Highly recommended for frequent drone users who value convenience and efficiency!"
"I concur that DJI makes great drones at many price points, and for many skill levels. Every one of the dozens of articles I read before purchase had DJI at the top of the recommended list. My only problem was deciding which drone to buy as a novice. I didn’t want to buy a >$1K package and have the drone fly off into the sunset, never to be seen again, on my first flight.  So, I split the difference on risk vs. cost/performance.  I bought a DJI, but not the newest model.  The better, but still very similar, model 4 would have cost more than twice as much for a similar package as this model 2.I’m happy to report that this drone is a great choice for adult beginners. It does not have the collision avoidance or 4k camera of the newest model, but it is essentially the same for basic setup and flight control and its camera performance is adequate. It really is a very nice drone, and I’m very happy I bought the DJI. It is relatively easy to set up and very easy to learn to fly. I really like the Mini2 SE and I’m glad I bought it.One thing I didn’t know about drones before researching is that all drones above 250 grams must be registered with the FAA, and some drones must initialize a flight approval each time they are used. So, if you buy a drone that weighs over 250 grams, be sure you understand what you are buying. It’s one thing to have to pay $5 and register once online, it’s another to have to be within cellphone signal range to initialize flight.  With the latter type you could be miles into a hike and not be able to use your drone at all due to no cell signal for flight authorization. The DJI Mini 2 SE is not either of those.Two things you will need, which are not included in this kit, are a charger plug adapter and a mini SD type memory card. It’s absolutely ridiculous that a $500 package, that includes everything else, does not include the plug adapter. DJI’s >$1K packages don’t either.  You need an 18 Watt or greater plug, such as the newer Apple devices use. Yes, most of us already have one, but that’s not the point. DJI should just charge $5 more and include one in the kit!  The memory card isn’t technically necessary but the images and video will be much higher quality if you use one. The DJI Mini 2 SE supports up to a 256 gigabyte card. A high quality name brand card is only ~$25 and a 128 gigabyte is half that. If DJI had included the SD card and charger plug, they would have only had to increase the price of this package by less than $20, and the customer would not have to scramble around trying to source missing pieces of the appropriate parameters. Another issue is the formatting of the SD card… It needs to be formatted in the drone itself but I never found any mention of this in DJI’s instructions. Query YouTube for a quick tutorial, it’s less than a 30 second process once someone walks you through the appropriate menus on the controller app.In summary, I have no real complaints just suggestions, this is a great drone made by the leader in this market segment. It’s high quality, easy to fly and many of the parts are interchangeable with prior and current models. Its basic flight capability is very comparable to the more expensive DJI models, but it is edged out by them on camera resolution and advanced features like object avoidance, but it costs significantly less. If price is not a concern, I’d recommend the Mini 4 unconditionally, it is better. However, the Mini 2 is also an excellent choice and I’m glad I chose it for my first drone. I may upgrade at some point in a few years, once I have a lot more experience, but I’m completely satisfied with this drone and would recommend it or buy it again in the same circumstances."
"The DJI Neo Mini Drone is an impressive piece of tech, especially for its compact size and weight of just 135g. As someone who loves capturing high-quality video on the go, the 4K UHD camera really blew me away. The video is sharp and stabilized, making it great for both casual flying and professional-looking footage. Plus, the built-in propeller guards add a layer of safety, perfect for flying in tight spaces.What I love most about the DJI Neo is the AI subject tracking—it follows me seamlessly without the need for a controller. The palm takeoff feature is incredibly fun and convenient, and the drone is smart enough to handle most flying situations on its own. The QuickShots feature makes creating dynamic shots super easy, and the controller-free operation is a game-changer for those who want a streamlined, hands-free flying experience.If you’re looking for a lightweight drone that packs a punch with its features, this is the one. The DJI Neo is perfect for both beginners and experienced flyers who want to capture incredible shots without worrying about controlling every move. Highly recommend!"

I have one question—how on earth is this thing less than four hundred dollars?! This is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made on a drone. It’s perfectly steady, and the camera is stunning. The quality of the footage is so clear and crisp, it’s almost unbelievable. And the range? It can go so far away that I can’t even fathom the distance.After receiving a terrible drone order that was a complete waste of money, I truly understood just how incredible the DJI Mini 2 SE is. It felt necessary to leave this review despite the fact that not many people might see it because the difference is night and day. This drone is leagues above anything else I’ve tried.Despite a few crashes, this drone works flawlessly and feels like it should be worth at least $1,500. The return-to-home feature is incredibly precise—literally down to the inch—and the motion sensors are spot-on as well.It's also ridiculously easy to fly, which is perfect for anyone, whether you're a beginner or an experienced pilot. The best part? You don’t even need to register it because it’s so lightweight. Plus, it’s super easy to bring into other countries. I packed this drone into a suitcase full of heavy shoes and other items for a trip from Virginia to Turkey. The suitcase was handled roughly, and the boxes inside were damaged—including the drone's box—but when I unpacked everything, the drone was completely unscathed. The build quality is just that good!Here’s something insane to think about: imagine there’s an island on the Chesapeake Bay you want to fly over. It’s 7 km away, and this drone has a 10 km range without any signal extenders. But here’s the catch—your drone isn’t fully charged. You figure it’s fine and put the drone in sport mode to help it get there faster. But you completely underestimate how long the charge will last (which, by the way, is super long with this amazing piece of tech). When you’re 4 km out, the drone warns you that it doesn’t have enough charge to go much further and return safely. If you don’t listen, it’ll automatically turn back on its own. It’s like this drone is designed to be unbreakable and impossible to lose!Oh, and did I mention it can even handle CRAZY winds? This thing is a total beast. Last thing: I recommend buying an extra 2 chargers and charging station. Instead of getting 31 mins of flight time, you can get 1.5 hours of it with three batteries. It makes a big difference.Long story short, if you’re on the fence, don’t be. Just buy it—you won’t regret it."
"Already own a sub 250 gram drone with a 4K camera and 3-axis gimble so...Did extensive research prior to purchasing the DJI Neo by reading/watching lots of reviews. After a few days toying with it, I am 110% sold. Nope by no means is it perfect yet IMHO, the positive far outweigh the negatives.Build quality is first rate in my opinion so should stand up fairly well. Props are well protected, battery latches firmly into place, has a camera guard/cover, power and mode control buttons are top mounted, has voice prompts, available in a ""Fly More Combo"" kit, etc.Super small footprint yet packs a punch. Multifunction in that it can be flown w/o a phone or RC controller, with a mobile phone, and/or with the DJI RC-N3 remote controller. Has palm takeoff and landing, voice control, AI subject tracking and quickshots, etc. Compared to other drones equipped with a single axis gimble, DJI stabilization technology really does a great job in keeping the footage smooth. I've gotten between 11-13 minutes of battery runtime so we are OK with that.My only real complaint(s) would have to be the limited onboard (non-removable/upgradable) storage. Although 22GB seems fairly ample so far it is an odd choice for such a device... To download footage requires plugging the drone into a device, no battery/power-on needed."

Okay let me start out with the stuff I don’t like. There’s not much…I don’t like how it doesn’t have rear obstacle avoidance. I wish it went just a little faster/more power for better air control. I also wish it had an adjustable aperture. Wish the EXP’s for yaw were lower and more yaw range in the gimbal. Wish it had slightly more dynamic range too.Okay now what I do like!Coming from an Inspire 2 with X5s, the size is the biggest advantage overall. The fact it folds down so small is amazing. No longer needing to carry around a 50lb pelican case for my drone is quite convenient lol. The Air 2S is much more low key and quiet for “sketchy” quick flights or through tight obstacles. Plus, the Air 2S shoots higher resolution than the Inspire. Yes, given it’s not Cinema DNG RAW, but the D-Log and 10-Bit H.265 files from the Air 2S are very workable (Especially with the new Mac M1 processors). It has maybe 12.5-13 stops dynamic range from my eye and color grading tests in Resolve. As for color grading the footage, the shadow recovery is much better than highlight recovery so try and always expose your image for the highlights as they cannot be recovered nearly as much in post. The files are a good bitrate 5.4K 24fps 10-Bit, meaning you have the resolution to zoom in without loss and they have better color tonality. The colors can be a little strange especially blue midtone shadows. Fixable in post though.You just have to understand how amazing it is to have a camera that you can put virtually anywhere in the air with a detailed 5.4K video. With three batteries charging you can get a lot of flights in one day with this guy, maximizing your opportunities for creative shots in many different locations. The size of the drone is amazing. Like legit the size of a large camera lens. The controller also fits nicely as the thumb sticks come off and store in it making it more flat. Also, the controllers battery life is just simply amazing. It lasts forever. The bag the drone comes with is extremely nice and great if you are just doing a trip with it. Everything fits in there. The included ND filters are very nice and honestly required for most flights. No noticeable color shift on the filters and they balance on the gimbal perfectly. I did order myself some additional CPL filters that helped quite a bit when shooting water and such. You may need something darker than ND32 for mid day shooting FYI.Battery life is roughly 20 mins of spirited flying while still leaving plenty reserve and not letting them go below 20% to extend their life. Plenty for some fun hyperlapses, which is an awesome included feature. The master shots feature (will the drone will fly itself and get some base level shots) is good to just do as a base level and completes in a couple mins. Results are good for zero effort.Finally, the range on it is superb. 9/10 situations it will have no problems. Staying within line of sight keeps signal the best (and legal). Flying behind objects will sometimes lose the connection. Also in cities (areas with lots of wifi signals) it has less range. But I would say it has better signal than the Inspire 2. The Inspire 2 was more “nimble” and “smooth” given the better power envelope of the motors, 360 spin of the gimbal, and second operator all adding to smoother footage of hard to track items, but could not go nearly as far. With the Air 2S line of sight becomes a TINY speck on the horizon.For a single man band this drone is only beaten by the Mavic 3, which is several times the price ($5k for the good “cinema” version). In my 10+ years of videography I haven’t been this stoked on a new tool in a while and it will be used a lot when the bigger cinema drones cannot fly or are not practical.Okay let’s compare the drones I have flown/used: Mavic Air 2S ($1000) vs Mavic Air ($500) vs Phantom 4 Pro ($1600) vs Inspire 2 X5S ($10,000) vs Freefly Alta 8 RED Monstro Zeiss CP3 ($175,000)When I compared the top dogs like an Inspire and a flying cinema camera (Alta 8), the Air 2S surprisingly holds its strengths pretty well. They are different tools for different jobs and are not apples to apples AT ALL but the fact the Air 2S and everything in the bag is about the same size as the MoVI (Alta 8’s Gimbal) Controller is kind of funny.The image quality on the Air 2S is much better than the Mavic Air and the P4P both in resolution and dynamic range. The resolution is comparable to the X5S camera but the dynamic range of the Air 2S is noticeably worse than the X5S. Obviously, if you are shooting something with budget and need 8K with good lenses, the Alta is your best bet. But that is 2 huge 80lb boxes, has a 10 min flight time at 45lbs with massive batteries. Minimum of 2 operators. Whole different beast. Can’t really compare the Alta to the Air 2S.If you’re into travel vlogging, weddings, real estate, landscape this is the perfect drone if you can’t quite stretch to get the Mavic 3.Also to compare this to the “48mp” Mavic Air 2, the pictures are actually much sharper because of the 1 inch sensor and better lens. Plus the Air 2 is a 12MP camera with pixel shift it’s marketing talk. Megapixels are not everything and the true 20 MP of the Air 2S will be enough for most uses I think.Also note 4K 60 has a crop where 5.4K does not. Can be pretty useful actually IMO.Amazing where technology is going and excited to see when the Mavic line comes out with interchangeable lenses someday! Great product DJI!Included is a video I made along the California Coast with exclusively the Mavic Air 2S and the included ND filters. Enjoy!"
"*UPDATED BELOW*Bought the DJI Mavic Air 2, two weeks ago before I knew an update was coming so soon buttt.... I just ordered the Air 2S! The Air 2 has been fantastic but I did run into some range issues or losing connectivity around buildings and residential areas. Hoping the updated unit with 4 antennas vs 2 will fix that issue. Also looking forward to the updated hardware and 1 inch sensor! Will post back with comparison and if it was worth the extra buy.*UPDATE*So today I just got the beautifully upgraded 2S only  two weeks after purchasing the Air 2. What are my first look and flight opinions... 100% worth the upgrade! Now don’t get me wrong the Air 2 is still an amazing drone and will work great for anyone but for me as I had the money and interest in learning how to edit video footage this upgrade was well worth it. Just look at the difference in the cameras in my pictures...  Air2S - aluminum or metal material gimbal and has a beautiful 1” sensor vs Air2 - .5” plastic sensor and tbh the picture on the Air2S is just flat out better. However the Air 2 is still a fully capable drone and I will still use it as my everyday drone and for riskier shots.As for the OcuSync 3.0 or better know as O3 I didn’t see a huge improvement on my first flight and I live in a suburb area with no tall buildings. That doesn’t mean that the range won’t be better for some but in my impression I saw no improvement here. I do have out of ground power lines all over where I live so this could be causing the issue. It generally lost signal when I was about .25 miles away and was flying low but would regain signal going above 65 feet. Not a huge deal breaker for me and I know others have said they saw a big improvement so maybe it’s the specific area where I live.Lastly, MASTER SHOTS! This is one of the coolest things about the drone IMO. You select your target and the Air2S shoots a sequence of really cool dynamic shots and throws them into an edit for you. It literally does everything for you and it comes out really cool if you want to impress your friends or social media followers.All in all 100% BUY THIS DRONE if it fits your budget. I don’t think it is too far off the price of the Air2 so if you have the extra cash I would definitely spend a little extra and go with the Air2S. In my opinion - Always go with the Fly More Combo - I got it on both drones."
"This purchase completes my DJI family. The Mavic Air 2s was the only model that I didn't have. I spent months agonizing whether I should buy it. But, a few advantages to the newest 2s FMC (fly more combo) finally tipped the scale.With the improvements to the OAS, autonomous flight programs and enhanced image quality, I just could not say 'no' to the Air 2s. And, who buys just the drone basic package, just to struggle with getting the additional accessories one by one later on? I'd rather just get what I need now and get it over with, as the FMC. Then, pick up the few accessories that I know I will need to round out the set.The Air 2s is on par with the rest of the DJI aircraft for performance and reliability. It's very easy to fly. It interfaces with your smart phone very smoothly. The controls are straightforward and simple to understand and operate. It's larger than the Mini, smaller than the M2P and right in the middle, price wise.The complications of adhering to FAA regulations and licensing have been simplified with built in and available software. The most basic things to remember right now are that, as a recreational flyer, you need to register with the FAA and display your registration number on all of your aircraft. BTW, as a recreational flyer, you only need to register once, as a pilot, and YOUR number is what's displayed on the drone. Each aircraft does NOT need to be registered. That is with the pilots that want to fly for profit.Because the Air 2s is heavier that 250g, your number has to be applied to this drone, in an obvious place on the exterior of the drone. I recommend using a label maker to do the FAA number and your cell phone number.The Air 2s is a great aircraft and like all of my DJI aircraft, it gets 5 stars."
"I currently have a Phantom 3 Pro, an Air 2 and Air2S. Both the Air 2 and the Air2S are great drones to fly. I prefer the Air 2S due to the fact that it has a better camera. I am using this with the Smart Controller as the iphone screens are not bright enough for sunny days. Love the drone and love the controller!"
"The Dji Air 2s is a masterpiece of engineering. Keep in mind this is my first major drone purchase. I'm completely ametuer. These drones have laws and regulations surrounding them. Please find your local laws and regulations. I had to register mine through transport Canada and even pass a test to obtain a basic drone pilot's license. Enough about that shit. This drone out of box runs spectacular. I would recommend buying the blade guards, they add a little weight but give good protection. My first run with it was at my local campsite I own and the nearest lake. You can use this to take amazing videos as well. They are so many options and modes that its impossible to use the all. My first run with this drone was brief, I used it then put it away to read up on heights in the local area. I then used it at a local creek, I was flying far and over swampy lands. Well it lost connection. I thought I just lost my drone. But it will stop where connection was lost and attempt to require signal. It will then return to home. Amazing. The whole reason I wrote this post was because I literally just ran into the side of a pine tree. I was night flying and assumed the sensors would kick in but I guess they don't work at night. The drone then fell approx 10 ft into the ground. That was it I thought. I'm an idiot for night flying in and enclosed area. I walked over to the drone. Visually inspected it. The gimbal Camera was overloaded. But the drone itself was folded up. Apparently they told up when something like this happens. The drone was still in perfect condition. A quick restart fixed the overloaded gimbal . I would highly recommend this drone to anyone."
"Greatest thing ever !!"
"Very controllable in all 3 flight modes. Very steady and sensitive movements in Cine mode, Normal mode drone responds quicker and flies faster, Sport mode it really moves! I intentionally tested it on a windy day to see how it handled and it is impressive. The drone handled the winds very well for being a mini and took amazingly steady pictures without blurring in the wind. Both the drone and the controller are well made and modern looking. The controller paired easily and quickly to the drone and my Android phone. The app has many features also. The case is fantastic the way the top opens and all parts fit into a secure spot with much easier access than the usual shoulder bags they come with. The SE is a great drone for the money and it was delivered by Amazon very quickly also. Thanks Bewine for making a great product at a reasonable price!"

From the moment I opened the box, I knew I had purchased a quality product. The presentation was excellent, with a case that, for a budget drone, feels very well made and adds great value to the package. The compact fabric of the case is of high quality and its design, with a practical handle, allows the drone to be easily carried anywhere without fear of damaging it.Upon opening the case, I found a lightweight but well-built drone, with materials that, although simple, do not feel low quality. The battery also surprised me, as it reaches almost the flight time specified in the description, allowing for plenty of time in the air to capture photos and videos.As for the camera, for a starter drone, it produces good quality images and videos. Even on a windy day, I was able to control it without problems and take sharp photos. The sunlight affected the quality a little, but in my case this was due to the smoke in the environment, something specific. Despite that, the flight and photography experience has been incredible and different.I recommend this drone to those looking for an affordable option without compromising too much on quality. It's perfect if you want to experience it without investing in an expensive drone that would probably offer you similar performance. So far, I haven't found any drawbacks and will continue to update if anything comes up. Overall, it's an excellent purchase."
"This drone was advertised as a cheaper alternative to drones costing hundreds - the reality is it's still a fairly expensive drone that has limited battery life, limited operating range and some communications glitches. On the negative side:The battery life is only about 10 minutes per pack. - there is an approximately 25% capacity reserve which is basically unusable since the drone will only allow return-to-start flight when the battery shows 2 of four bars.The operating range is only approximately 150' before the unit starts glitching and the communication starts freezing for periods of time. If you exceed this range, the chances are good that the drone will become uncontrollable until you walk closer. Any obstructions to line-of-sight will result in signal loss (think about your home wifi).The camera is very high def, but there is no gimbal so the images are very shaky. You can control the angle of the camera on one axis but requires bringing up an on-screen toggle.The positives:The GPS system seems very good - it will return to an area within a few feet of take-off. It is easy to calibrate and it has an on-screen indicator of location relative to the base. The auto return works reasonably well.The camera is very crisp and clear.The drone is easy to learn to operate even for a beginner, and the stabilization software works OK for low-wind days (<5-10 mph).Overall this drone is a decent, low-cost system but the price is a little high for the features provided, in my opinion. Limited range is the biggest disappointment."

"I wasn’t going to write a review however, I’m compelled to write something since I wasn’t expecting much as I upgraded from my Mavic 2 Pro / Smart Controller set up to the Mavic 3 / RC set up.  I honestly didn’t have many problems with the original controller and would have kept it if it were compatible with the Mavic 3.  The RC is an improvement in ways I didn’t think of and some of the “downgrades” from the original aren’t affecting me like I thought it would.**UPGRADES****Weight / Handling**This is the first thing that stood out to me.  I didn’t think the original was heavy at all however, compared to the RC, I’m noticing I’m not as fatigued after flying for around 2.5 hours.  Also, for it being lighter in weight, the grip feels MUCH better than the original. The RC also feels stronger and could survive an accidental drop a couple times.  The original felt like it would get destroyed from 1 accidental drop.**Speed**The RC is MUCH faster than the original in almost every aspect.  From turning on the controller, to booting up the app and connecting with my Drone.  Very impressed since this is an unexpected improvement over the original.  Touch operations are also as smooth as the original.**Price**The fact this controller is $309 at launch compared to $649 for the original at launch, it makes it that much harder to justify paying $1199 for the RC Pro.  I haven’t used the RC Pro however, until I get some clients that would help me justify that price, I’m totally happy with the RC.**Battery Life**Now that I’m writing this review, the one criticism I had of the original was the battery life.  Mine only lasted 2 hours and I’d have to connect it an external battery if I wanted to fly my Mavic 2 Pro and/or Air 2s for more than 3 batteries.  With the RC, I was able to fly for 2.5 hours with my Mavic 3 and still had 50% power left.  Also, when both the original and RC are connected to PD chargers, it seems the RC charges faster than the original.  I haven’t tested this extensively, but it’s something I’m noticing.**Signal Strength**I’m not noticing any difference between using the Mavic 2 Pro (or Air 2s) / w Smart Controller vs using the Mavic 3 with the DJI RC.  I didn’t have any problems with the original in this regard so, the RC is good to go for me.  This for me is impressive seeing the RC’s antennas are inside the controller vs the original had external antennas.  For me, I don’t have to worry as much about breaking the antennas with the RC in case of an accidental drop.**""DOWNGRADES""****Screen Brightness**To be honest, I’m not noticing much of a difference between the 700 nits of the RC compared to the 1000 nits of the original.  I was able to compare them side by side and only noticed the difference when looking at them directly.  One thing that somewhat annoyed me with the original was the fact I would still need to stand in the shade sometimes during the day.  The difference in nits doesn’t change this at all for my needs. For a summer in Utah, all I need to do is operate the controller in my own shadow and I’m good.  That’s also what I had to do when I lived in Texas while using the original smart controller.  I never thought I needed a sunshade with the original and at this time, I don’t need one with the RC.  Plus, the difference in brightness is NOT a game changer for me either way.**No Way to Install Custom Apps**I had a few custom apps on the original Smart Controller but ended up never using them.  This is not an issue for me with the RC and I still have my RC-N1 in case I need to use a tablet with other apps.  I also don’t care about the downgrade in screen recording quality.  I did like navigating thru the android OS in the original but, I’ll be fine without that option in the RC.**HDMI Out**This is the only downgrade that stings a bit with me.  I’ve used HDMI out a few times with the original and loved the fact my clients could see what I’m doing.  Since it’s been a while since I had a client with that need, plus with other financial obligations, I had a hard time justifying a $900 increase for the RC Pro at this time.  When I have a client with that need, I’ll have no problem getting the RC Pro, but I’ll keep the RC for everyday use.  Who knows, DJI might enable a USB-C to HDMI output option in the future for the RC.**Dual Operators**This is a feature I’d like to see added to the Mavic 3 in the future.  The Mavic 2 Pro had this feature and it would be nice to use the new RC controllers in this way.**Lack of Buttons Compared to Original**This was something I thought would bother me but, DJI has you covered.  The original has a 5D button I often used to control the exposure however, with the RC, I'm fine with using the touch screen.  You can also hold one of the C buttons behind the controller, then use one of the control wheels above the controller to adjust the exposure.  Something I can get used to, but nothing to complain about.**OVERVIEW**I was on the fence for a long time about upgrading my Mavic 2 Pro to the Mavic 3 due to how expensive the upgrade would be, especially with the early issues with the Mavic 3.  I also couldn’t afford the RC Pro.  When I crashed my Mavic 2 Pro, I was forced to move forward with the Mavic 3 and the RC-N1.  Once the RC became compatible with the Mavic 3, I felt like my Mavic 3 experience was complete, especially with the Mavic 3 issues being corrected in firmware.  Once you use any smart controller, It’s hard going back to using your smartphone / tablet when flying your drone and I’m very happy and relieved with the performance of the DJI RC.  I think DJI should bundle the RC with the Mavic 3 Fly More Combo by default, but I’m glad it’s finally compatible with the Air 2s."
"Great having the clear, bright built-in screen. Battery time is really good."
"> Setup is simple. Just follow the instructions and answer the questions.> Had to update the firmware on both my controller and my drone first, but it was all automatic.> My MINI 3 is less than 250g so no government registration was needed.> I am five miles from an air force base so I agreed to fly at altitudes under 400 feet. Not an issue.> The screen is clear and bright enough to see in sunlight.> Controls are very responsive in all directions.> Has more physical control knobs than the controller using my phone.> The battery in the controller lasts long enough that you can make multiple flights without recharging.> Cannot use third party apps like you can on your phone but I bought it to free my phone from flight duty.> Three flight modes to match video capture needs, normal flights, and full speed flights.> Highly recommended as a new drone pilot."
"This RC was an excellent purchase with wonderful functionality.  However, not even a year into ownership it started draining its batteries rapidly.  I could barely get through one flight of my Air2S before the batteries were almost exhausted.I upgraded to an RC Pro and sent the RC to DJI for repair.  They investigated and discovered that the board had an issue and it was out of warranty so they replaced the entire unit with a new one...and charged me $220.Obviously this was most likely an issue with this individual unit and not a reflection on all other DJI RC units and products which are of outstanding quality.  Im sharing this just in case anyone else has similar battery issues."
"Necessary upgrade for flying a DJI drone. The screen quality is superb and so is the battery life. Have used this for volunteer search and rescue and more regular video uses while at home or traveling. The only downside is transferring files to the phone to share them when working and time is of the essence. I transfer the video/image from the controller to the phone to the laptop to a shared folder for review and syncing with maps and whatnot. There may be a faster way that I do not know. I still recommend this controller 100%. I only wish I could afford the even more superb controller and an even better drone from DJI."
"This one has stronger signal than control by cell phone, big screen has a clear view and easy to reach all function"
"Very handy great screen. Much easier to use"

First up - my drone flying experience was one failed flight on a cheap drone 3 years ago which put me off trying a more expensive one. Big mistake.Thankfully this DJI Mini 4K was on a Prime deal so I took a chance. 1 million percent happy I did. My passion is making videos of nature and local events. I use good quality equipment and wanted something that could enhance my videos but not look cheap. I watched some YouTube videos on the DJI Mini 2 (and 4K - basically the same drone) and took a chance.REVIEW:1. Ridiculously easy to fly. No crashes, no near misses and no chance it will fly away. All of which I had in the first day using the afore mentioned cheap drone. This DJI takes off and just hovers there - no moving, no drifting. You push up on the left stick and it goes up. You pull down on the left stick it comes down and lands. It's that easy. First flight I even landed it on my hand because the grass was a bit long. (I have bought a landing mat)2. Safe - following on from easy to fly is safety. The built in return to home features mean this drone is next to impossible to lose. Yes, you could fly it into a tree or building, but because you see what the camera see and you have accurate height information would mean it's your fault - not the drones. I have taken things slow and so far I have done some fairly long distance flights (400ft high and almost a mile away). If I lose sight of the drone, I use the map on the screen to line it up with me and fly it back. If I really get stuck I press the Return To Home and it flys itself back and lands.3. Video quality - beautiful. The image is incredibly stable (as you would expect from DJI), the picture quality is excellent and compliments my other equipment. This little drone is punching way above its weight. And again, because you have live video feedback in your hands getting reasonable composed shots in the first week is possible. See attached video. It's a learning curve for sure, but using any new video camera is. The skill is not having the $ to but the equipment, but learning to use it properly. The cheap drone I tried 3 years ago was unusable video - shaky, soft, washed out colors. This DJI is fantastic in auto mode, and in manual mode you have some control over the recording settings. And because it is so stable in flight, you can concentrate on making sure the video you are recording is good - you are not worrying that the drone will crash.4. Value - I paid $239 on Prime deal day. What a steal. The build quality is excellent. The IOS App is easy to use. No issues connecting, no stability issues, not bugs found. Flight time is about 20 - 25 minutes, which is more than enough for what I need.5. Extras - Technically everything you need, apart from a Micro SD card,  is in the basic package. You don't need to buy anything else. But some nice to have extras, that I have now bought are : More batteries - I bought the 2 batteries and charger (renewed) pack for $88. I also bought a protection case $20, a landing mat $18, a screen shield to help with bright sunlight viewing $20. I am also using Freewell ND filters, so far I have bought 4 of them $60. But technically all of these are not needed. But my advise would be to get the flymore pack if you have the budget - it makes a saving - but for me on the Prime day deal it was not an option, only the basic kit was reduced.Summary: I love this little drone. It has given me the confidence to get out there and fly. Its easy to fly, the video is great and the value its excellent. I was scarred by a cheap drone experience. The motto ""buy cheap, buy twice"" has never been more true. I could not recommend this product any higher. If you are a complete beginner then this is the place to start."
"As a newcomer to the world of drones, I could not decide between Holy Stone HS900 and the DJI Mini 4K. So I decided to do what any reasonable adult does that has expendable income, I bought both...lol. Here’s a detailed comparison based on my experiences with both models.Holy Stone HS900Pros:Ease of Use: The HS900 is incredibly user-friendly, making it a great choice for beginners. The controls are intuitive, and it is easy to get it up and flying right out of the box.Photography: The drone takes good quality pictures, which is impressive for its price range. The camera captures clear and sharp images that are suitable for casual photography.Cons:Range: One major downside I noticed is that the HS900 does not live up to its advertised range. The actual operational range is considerably shorter, which can be disappointing if you’re looking to explore or cover larger areas.Video Transmission: While the photos are good, the video transmission quality doesn’t match up to higher-end models. There is noticeable lag and occasional signal loss, which can be frustrating during flights.DJI Mini 4KPros:Range: The Mini 4K excels in this department. Its range is significantly better than the HS900, allowing for extended flights and greater exploration without worrying about losing connection.Video Transmission: The video quality on the Mini 4K is outstanding. It provides a clear and stable feed, making it ideal for capturing high-quality footage and ensuring smooth operation during flights.Overall Value: Considering the features and performance, the DJI Mini 4K offers exceptional value for its price. It stands out as the clear winner in terms of both range and video quality.ConclusionFor someone new to drones like myself, both the Holy Stone HS900 and the DJI Mini 4K have their merits. The HS900 is a good starter drone, particularly for photography and ease of use. However, if you’re looking for a drone that offers better range, superior video transmission, and overall higher performance, the DJI Mini 4K is the clear winner."
"After trying one of the Holy Stone drones thinking I would save a few bucks since I only need a drone for one specific purpose, but being disappointed with the video quality of it, I returned it and bought the DJI Mini 4K.  Let me tell you, this blew me out of the water.The remote comes pre-connected to the drone, and when you plug the remote into your phone, it automatically brings up the DJI Fly app and you're instantly ready to fly.  No calibration needed, no settings to change, just press the button and go.Video quality is amazing and on par with the $1000+ drones DJI makes.  Zero jitters, movement is super smooth and the gimbal does a great job stabilizing the shots.  The built-in ""quickshots"" are incredible and super easy to use.  This was a big problem I had with the Holy Stone drone I tried, the preset flight paths didn't work as expected.  With the Mini 4k, you press one button, tap on the part of the image you want it focus on on the screen, and off it goes circling, spiraling, or whatever else you tell it to do around the object you selected.  Only downside is it doesn't seem to be able to do a continuous circle - once it does 360 degrees, it stops recording.  There may be a fix for this but if so, I haven't found it yet.  But it's really a minor inconvenience.I got about 25 minutes of flight time on a single fully charged battery, and I have an extra battery and charger on the way.  I wish it included a case, but I bought one for $20 on Amazon so that solves that.I would recommend this drone to anyone who doesn't need ultra-advanced features that you'd find on the $1000 drones."
"This is my third mini 2 I like them but one word of advice when buying used from anyone or from Amazon make sure to download app and view your profile in there make sure it is not bound to another persons email if so call DJI and they will help you out to fix it.The build is great and very durable except if you hit a tree  very fun and easy  I would recommend starting off on normal not sport  until you figure out how fast and how long it takes to stop and move  but it is really fun and can go very far"
"This drone takes lovely 1080p video and ok 4k video.It lacks object tracking, apart from the quick shots features, so you have to aim the camera(and therefore the drone) manually.It doesn't have waypoints so you cannot set a path for the drone to follow.It is a good quality drone, easy to use and take nice images, but without the tracking feature, I am a little disappointed with it.The other drone companies include such features at this price point, so perhaps shop around?Good delivery times and tracking, thanks Amazon :)"
"I’m a beginner, the camera quality is amazing and it is easy to operate.Very steady in the air and definitely more than I expected for the price.The only downside is the battery life. I would definitely recommend getting additional batteries if you plan on flying for more than 20-30 minutes at a time."
"Works with Drone as advertised"
"First thing was started up here we go 30064 error code. It hooked up easy once I got my in pair mode . The distance from the controller is lot shorter,can’t go as far as my original controller."
"Works great love it"
"This controller was nothing but aggravating for me. It wouldn't connect to internet and it wouldn't let me log in to my DJI account which really limits your flight to a baseballs throw distance away. You'd think that for this amount of money it would be flawless but I had to jump through so many hoops to try and get it to work that finally it wasn't worth it. So I returned it AND I had to pay for shipping for their bum product!"
"As I have said before, I really wish DJI was an American Company. Their Products are far and above anything all of the US Drone makers (not many are there?) can match. Build quality, sturdiness and durability in all sorts of weather is unmatched.In the vast cosmos of drone technology, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine Drone shines like a supernova, illuminating the path for aerial cinematography. From the moment I unboxed this aerial marvel, I knew I was in for an unparalleled flying experience.Stunning Image Quality: The Mavic 3 Pro Cine doesn't just capture moments; it immortalizes them in breathtaking clarity. The image quality is nothing short of spectacular, making every frame worthy of the big screen. Whether I'm capturing the serene beauty of a sunrise or the intricate patterns of a bustling city, the results are consistently awe-inspiring. It's like having a Hollywood-grade camera that soars!Impressive Specs: This drone is a testament to DJI's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. With its advanced obstacle sensors, the Mavic 3 Pro Cine navigates the skies with the grace and precision of a ballet dancer. The Hasselblad camera, with its impeccable resolution and color accuracy, ensures that every shot is a masterpiece. And let's not forget the impressive transmission range, allowing for expansive exploration without compromise.Extended Flight Time: The Mavic 3 Pro Cine isn't just a sprinter; it's a marathon runner. The extended flight time means I can stay airborne longer, capturing extended sequences and exploring vast landscapes without the constant worry of battery drain. It's truly liberating to know that time is on my side as I navigate the skies.The DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine Drone isn't just a purchase; it's an investment in unparalleled aerial cinematography. It's a fusion of cutting-edge technology and artistic prowess, all packed into a sleek, compact design. For those looking to elevate their filming game and soar to new cinematic heights, this drone is the ultimate co-pilot. Here's to many more flights filled with breathtaking visuals and boundless exploration!"
"I purchased this drone as an upgrade from my mini 4 pro. Wow what a difference!The zoom is incredible, today I took pictures 400ft up and zoomed in max and could make out items 25 miles away. It may not have been super high quality due to the time of day and the haze from out high humidity but it still blows my mind.The main camera is where the money is. The clarity and detail of it brings everything to a new detail. The higher resolution of my video allows me to still crop without needing to drop far below 4k.I have yet to see this quality. I still am a little nervous to test it's flying ability but I can see this being used as my main drone. Only using my mini for the low altitude following. I can not recommend this more."
"This is a great drone for existing drone flyers to move up to.  I moved up from my DJI Mini 3 Pro drone so I already knew the basics of flying and drone videos.  I would not recommend this for first time drone pilots.  The Hasselblad camera with three lenses is spectacular with both auto and pro (manual) settings.  The photo quality is incredible.  The controller is the top of the line with a crystal clear screen and various customization options. Best of all this is a professional  level aircraft with way too many options to list.  For me one of the highlights is the ability to pre-program flights so complicated maneuvers are handled by the software and are always perfect.  With the three intelligent batteries you have about two hours of flying time.  Charging is a bit slow so always start with the batteries fully charged.  I added a polarizing filter, a two level carrying case and a second, faster, battery charger so I'll have one at home and one in my carrying case at all times. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny."
"After roughly a month or less of purchasing a brand new DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine, I now have been fighting back and forth for weeks for DJI to honor their POS equipment. As an extensive DJI Prosumer, this was not what I expected of not just the product, but even worse the support from DJI.On a clear day just a few weeks ago, I was flying this drone for a project of mine in Florida. Within the first 3 minutes of the flight, I had the RC Pro in my hand sitting on my palm with the right side gripped with zero hands or fingers on any buttons or joysticks, Mavic 3 hovering.I went to take a seat on the tailgate of my truck to better face the drone as I like to face the flight path and make sure I have total visual in my peripheral too. Well during the 7, maybe 9, or 10-second max it took to move from the front seat to the tailgate, I looked down to see my RC controller screen black, prompting no connection to the drone. Confused, I pressed Home to hopefully still have some sort of connection or control and I could get the drone back to me.It did nothing, and I'm now a little concerned because it's prompting a ton of alerts and I have no idea where it is, the drone was never to be seen or connected again. Confused and worried, I walked over to where I recall it last hovering, praying it was still there or just landed right where it was, I never located the drone, until 3 hours later after canvassing a 500ydx500yd grid of the area to find the drone just 130 ish yards from that location, completely destroyed.After opening a case on the drone and the incident that had occurred, DJI conveniently cannot and refuses to address or answer why and/or how it would propel itself forward while not being instructed to by the operator as I had zero body contact to the joysticks, continuing to avoid that, they keep stating it was a pilot error.Instead, they keep telling me that it's a pilot error and continuously keep routing me to a different person of contact, and they refuse to address why it did this.Sadly, my creative team uses a heavy amount of DJI products, and we will replace them with a brand that offers their prosumers more accurate support. I highly recommend you AVOID this organization and keep your money elsewhere."
"Best quality and tech in a drone. This thing is amazing."
"Camera is great resolution. Easy to fly, fun to use. You must be cognisant of regulations where you can and cannot fly. Battery life is pretty good, but considering how much fun it is to use, spare batteries are a strong recommendation (and they are not inexpensive). If I somehow crash it and break it, I sure will try again!"
"I bought this for the better camera and it doesn't disappoint. The zoom and picture quality is amazing especially compared to the mini series. Expensive but worth every penny"
"I tried it and is awesome, unfortunately, I cant afford it for now, and lets say there are other reasons just to be safe. I wish I could buy this."
"easy to fly,gets better with time"
"I had flown FPV years ago when you had to build your own. Flying/racing got tiresome keeping it all working together and then rebuilding after a crash. The learning curve was very high. This drone makes it so ANYONE can fly FPV. Use the simulator or stay in 'beginner' mode at first and your family can fly with you. The drone is pretty tough but I really recommend the DJI Care Refresh. And as of this month (June 2024) the drones no longer sync to DJI, your data is your data. Just sayin"
"It is as described and fit everything I have for my drone perfectly. Strong sturdy and holds shut. What else do I need."
"Love the fit and protection for my DJI Air 2.  The only negative is that I wish it was cut out to leave the joysticks in the controller while storing."
"I choose this case for the quality, size and price.  From picture, it looks solid to me.  As i received it, it is a very well built case.  The size is just right, not too big, easy to carry around, although i hope a mesh pocket inside would be more helpful."
"I've had this case for about 2 months and took it on a road trip. Verdict: it's awesome!The exterior is very sturdy — enough to toss around without worry. But what I'm most impressed with is the foam inside. It's super dense and seems super high quality.The size of the container is perfect. It's big enough to store all your peripherals, yet small enough to take anywhere. I even threw the whole thing inside my backpack to take it hiking, without it feeling cumbersome.If you're looking for a high quality case for an affordable price, this is the one!"
"Product is high quality and as advertised. Recommended"
"I purchased this case hoping it would be a durable and waterproof option for my kayak adventures. The build quality is good — it's incredibly sturdy and feels like it could withstand quite a bit of wear and tear. The latches snap securely, and the materials feel durable enough for long-term use.One downside is that this case does not live up to its waterproof claims. After submerging it in water for a short period, I noticed water made its way inside. This was quite disappointing since I specifically wanted something that could handle full submersion. It seems to work fine for light rain or splashes, but if you're planning on taking it into water or trusting it in extreme wet conditions, I wouldn’t.  I returned it for another one, but it had the same problem.For most other uses, it's great. It’s ideal for keeping things safe from dirt, dust, and general outdoor conditions. For daily use or even travel where you don’t expect to fully submerge it, this case will do the job well. Since I wanted it purely for being waterproof.  I have returned them both and will be looking elsewhere."
"Been using it about a month, now - solid build, provides a good fit, and a good value overall."
"This drone is awesome! It will do things I haven't even figured out yet. The pictures and videos are amazing. I love this thing. Very well constructed. Amazon had the best price and you could even make 0% interest payments was offered. It is the most fun, and best serious, flying machine I've ever had. If you need to make any observations from the air this is the machine to use. The controls are very sensitive yet responsive. With the collision avoidance system you would have to intentionally crash it. It keeps you from doing stupid stuff. The controller is amazing with so much information and clear pictures of what the drone is doing and it's location. You get into a sticky situation let go of the controls and it comes to a stop so you can get your bearings before you move again. It's awesome!"

Received FLYMORE package today from Amazon October7, 2023. Ordered last night around 8pm and received package around 10am… Fast!  Like many “Precious or delicate” items ordered from Amazon I got the typical box nearly twice the size of the box inside… usually not a problem unless it’s the typical box twice the size of the box inside with ZERO bubble wrap, air pack, or crumbled paper you SHOULD have to protect the nearly 1800$ box inside, so yeah, Cool…. Thanks Amazon for the I don’t “care package”!  And wouldn’t you know… the DJI box had a dent on the bottom of it, just what you want to see when you spend your hard earned money or in my case charged, using the 12mo. Financing and haven’t even made my first payment yet….come on Amazon!, you make way too much money to cut corners and have no excuses.On to the drone…. Unboxed and items seem to be ok thanks to the great packaging by DJI utilizing the nice carrying bag as it’s packaging insulation.I have everything opened up and ready, and the power bank charger cable is due to arrive in a few days. The point in starting this in real time review is that I figured I’d go ahead and plug the USB c charger into the average standard charging outlet at least so I can potentially fly before the arrival of the power bank charger… however I plugged it in shortly before 11am and it’s now 9pm as of writing this and Not even the first battery is at 3 bars than it dawned on me that my MacBook Pro had a USB c power bank charger, and sure enough.. I plugged it in and the speed went from Snail to rapid and within 30 minutes it finished the first and now 3/4 the way on the 2nd battery. This is what compelled me to start the review earlier for those that want to save a few bucks and happen to have a newer MacBook Pro with the same output range charger, before doing so however double check the specs of the DJI version and your current one first for the same or similar “safe” output V/A.This is my first DJI drone, I’ve had many, I can already tell that without even flying it yet that the build quality has surpassed all but one 10k cinema drone that’s out of my budget, so I’m eager to fly and thus far impressed with what I see from DJI.That’s it for now, weather permitting i will check back in with updates, as the journey begins…. And with fingers crossed hopefully the journey ends well too.Happy flying!Update-12/29/23The drone is absolutely amazing, I have been on several trips and the footage is bar none the best!  I haven’t had any lag which you see in most below average drones constantly which really is what causes you to crash, so this is exceptional as you won’t be flying into a stray object unless you’re not paying attention.The obstacle avoidance is great but keep in mind it will NOT pick up objects with little definition… limbs with no leaves are a nemesis…. So high alert if flying near them.All in all I’ve been so impressed with the quality of DJI, since this purchase I went in to buy the pocket 3, the mini pro 4 fly more, the DJI dual mics, the iPhone gimbal, the ronin 3 pro gimbal and so on, I’m blessed to be able to do so. The company and products are great! And I needed a core company and product line to wrap around for my upcoming ventures.I can see them entering the Full Frame or cinema style Camera scene soon and if so, I will take the leap, until then I’m with my Nikon for that.I hope to see Major upgrades to the software App side however, that is one of two weakness that should be noted of DJI as whole that I’ve spotted thus far… the second is important as well, and that is the “Intelligent battery” system  doesn’t seem to be intelligent enough to maintain the batteries power, so do make sure you top off batteries if they have sat idle for days or weeks, as they do lose power.  I was a bit disappointed with this however I purchased the 2 yr extended plans on all the devices and if they fall short I will be filing a claim on those in particular.No other issues thus far… as of this update, absolutely buy this if you’re on the fence.  The quality and experience are top notch! Attached a vid and few photos, not sure of what quality they’ll display but on my end they’re on point.See you soon for another update!"
"Air 3 has completely transformed my aerial cinematographer experience. As a filmmaker, I rely on the latest technology to capture unique, breathtaking visuals.One aspect I particularly appreciate is the ease of integrating this drone into my existing workflow. With the two cameras, ND filters, and upgraded sensor, it allows me to achieve even higher production value in my footage. It's now easier to match it with the footage from other cameras we use in production. The compatibility and versatility of the drone make it an indispensable tool for my aerial cinematography projects.Cinematic FootageThe dual primary cameras equipped with 70 mm medium telephoto and wide-angle lenses deliver exceptional image quality. The footage is sharp, vibrant, and cinematic, truly enhancing the storytelling element of my work. Whether I'm shooting landscapes, action sequences, or establishing shots, the image quality never fails to impress.Active TrackAir 3 offers a wide range of flight modes - Active track, focus track, QuickShots and more. I mostly use the ActiveTrack mode for smoothly tracking subjects, and the Waypoint mode for precise path planning. Overall, this provides the versatility needed to capture shots with precision and creativity.Extended control rangeAir 3 control range is up to 20 kilometers. That's pretty impressive. I can escape the limitations of traditional equipment and plan shooting from remote locations.In conclusion, Air 3 is a powerful tool.  It is not in par with more advanced drones like Mavic 3 Pro, but still provides cinematic image quality, versatile flight modes, and longer range. If you're a beginner filmmaker or looking to switch from older models, this drone os definitely the one to consider."
"As an enthusiast, this is everything I ever wanted in a drone. Easy to use, fantastic safety features, and top-notch video and photo quality. Can't go wrong with the Air 3"
"I already own the mini 4 pro but wanted something that could sustain high winds. I brought this to fly over the sea where gusts were up to 70 km/hr and it held out well. Although I did receive some high wind warnings on my controller, the video quality was still very stable and the Air 3 was able to fly with ease. But be careful flying in high wind situations, as it will not be able to return to home automatically."

I've been flying the DJI Mavic Air 3 for a while now, and there’s a lot to love about this drone. It has some standout features like the zoom lens, an impressive flight time of over 40 minutes per battery, and exceptional durability in windy conditions, thanks to its weight being over 250g. I was also really impressed that it came with so many extra propellers.However, if I had to choose again between the Air 3 and the DJI Mini Pro 4, I might lean towards the Mini Pro 4. While the Air 3’s zoom feature is handy, it's not truly 4K quality, which limits its usefulness in certain shots. The Mini Pro 4 offers the same main camera as the Air 3 but has the added advantage of being under 250g, making it more versatile and usable in more locations, and easier to let others fly because no drone pilot license would be required.That being said, I do love the Mavic Air 3. There were some opportunities for improvement such as the drone doesn't come with a case or protective covering for the propellers, and the blades easily get caught when putting the drone in the bag. I was also surprised it only came with one charging cord - three would have been ideal to optimize all the charging ports if possible because the batteries do take a long time to charge.Overall, I would rate the Mavic Air 3 a 4.5/5. It’s an excellent drone, but with a better quality zoom lens, it could easily be a full 5 stars."
"As a hobbyist only, I didn’t want to get into having to register with FAA or deal with the new FAA Remote ID requirements for drones that is upcoming in 2023.  But will say a drone under .55 lbs is tiny…  my old toy drone was twice the size of the Atom SE.Anyway, in my usage I found the addition of GPS really took this to the next level for me – makes it very stable drone.  There are a few setup videos you can watch from within the app (PotensicPro), suggest you do this.  Also take some time going through the app, looking at and setting things up before trying to fly.  That and the setup guide was all I needed, other than to allow time for a few updates to install and do compass calibration.This drone hovers very stable, even in wind and it’s very fast and responsive.  And with GPS, the Return to Home feature worked really well – within five feet.  Do suggest you set the height of RTH to the highest structure or tree in your flying area, as there is no obstacle avoidance (other than straight down).  Keep in mind RTH is from takeoff point, not where you are at that point (if you move around). The Follow Me feature, only follows the controller, and this wasn’t very smooth. But way points worked great.Images were GREAT with this 12 MP Sony Sensor, and even better after viewing the SD Card.  Now flying in wind is where you’ll find that not having a 3-Axis Gimble is an issue for video, that and not being smooth on the throttle (but I’ll get there).  If you are buying this for fun of flying, it’s will meet your needs.  Will say the EIS does do a pretty good job, I saw videos of reviews of other drones in this price range… many had a lot of “jello” in them.  I haven’t seen that at all on the ATOM SE.  The Camera has a motorized gimbal to tilt up and down during flight, another improvement from my “toy” drone.  But I hope Potensic can make this work a little slower in future software updates.It uses your phone (I have an iPhone) to connect to the controller with a provided cable to view FPV video as you fly, and for some settings.  Had no issues with the flight video dropping out, but where I was flying, I couldn’t test the limits of the range…  I only went about 2,000’ was as far as I could go and keep line of sight.Drone is very fast in Sports mode, just learning so I kept in in Video mode most the time.  Modes can be changed in the app while in flight.  Was very easy to control even with some winds that would have blown my old “toy” drone away.Price… not sure what to say here I got it for about $235 with New Year’s sale and an affiliate coupon code from one of those review channels.  I felt at that price point, it was a great value.Pros:- Under 250 Grams so no registration required.- Video and Pictures are great for a Hobby device.- Potensic is doing firmware updates on this new drone (hope they support it a long time)- Quality seemed good for the price paid.- Came as a complete package (fly more style).- Good flight time, 26 Mins- True Radio Drone, not WiFi.  So very long control and FPV range- Really fun to fly, clear upgrade over non-GPS drones.Cons:- Lack of 3-Axis Gimble (think it was FB they mentioned a gimble version is in the works)- Follow Me, didn’t work to well- No obstacle avoidance- $299 suggested price… at that point a DJI Mini SE might push me to spend a little more.- New drone, so no parts at this point"
"I recently bought the Potensic Atom SE, and I am truly impressed by how well this drone performs. Right out of the box, it was easy to set up and get flying, which is great if you’re newer to drones or just want something user-friendly. The camera quality is surprisingly clear, capturing sharp, stable footage that looks professional. The GPS and return-to-home features are reliable and give me peace of mind while flying. Battery life is decent, and it charges fairly quickly, allowing for more frequent flights.Overall, I’d recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality drone. It's perfect for casual users and hobbyists who want a taste of professional features without the high price."

I have had the Potensic Atom SE drone now for over a month and have flown it every weekend, so now I feel I can post an honest review. This is reall a great drone. May not have all the bells and whistles of that other company, but it doesn't have the price tag either. This is my first drone with GPS and what a difference that makes. I also love the fact that if I'm ever in a panic situation I can just release the controller joysticks  and the drone will immediately stop whatever it's doing and hover in place. That's saved me a few times already. It is very easy to fly, even for a novice flyer. The controller and app are easy to handle and understand. Very comfortable controller and I like how it holds your phone, very easy to read, and has a range of 4km (about 2 1/2 miles) but I'll never really know how far it can go since I have to keep the drone itself in sight the whole time while flying. The furthest I've flown it was about 3200ft (about .6 miles) and the only reason I could see it that far off is because it was at twilight on a cloudy day and I could see my anticollision strobe blinking. The drone is very easy to handle, very responsive, and FAST! In Sport mode I reached 35mph, per the app. The video quality is impressive during the day, not so much at night. Photos are OK for use online and smaller photographs, but as a photographer I would like to see a better camera where I can make small enlargements, but, again, you can't complain too much at this price point. It handles windy days pretty well and have had no problems with it there. The Follow Me, Waypoint, and Circle Flight works as should and the RTH feature is great. I've initiated it myself a few times and had it return on it's own because of low battery, all times landing within feet of the takeoff point. I get about 25 minutes of flight per battery charge which is decent. The manual is easy to understand (although you have to download it, no physical manual with purchase) and the Customer Service has been GREAT. Had some concerns about the way my drone was packaged and they got back to me almost immediately and help solve my problem. Overall, I highly recommend this drone and you get alot for the price. I LOVE FLYING THIS THING! The ONLY regret I have in purchasing this is that I purchased it off of Amazon - nothing against Amazon, I love them too - but I wish I had gone directly to the Potensic website and seen the new and improved Atom drone and I would have definitley purchased that instead. At the time it was not available on Amazon (is now though) and is not that all more expensive than the SE.Update 11/22/2023 I mentioned in my review a few weeks back that I had a good experience with the Potensic Customer Service department and I had another great experience dealing with them again. Unfortunately, I had an accident with a tree and broke off my front right landing gear (the arm was fine) and couldn't find all the pieces. I emailed the customer service site and told them what happened and sent pictures and they got back to me within a day. They said it was repairable and gave me a price, plus gave me the option of purchasing a replacement Atom SE for a discounted price (BIG discount). After thinking about it I just went about fixing it myself with an old credit card, toothpick, and epoxy - think Frankenstein, but it flies no problem. I was tempted to take them up on their offer for the new SE, but would rather fix this one and save for an upgraded drone. When they asked what I'd like to do and told them I fixed it myself they were almost apologetic that I crashed my drone and offered to send me a new set of paddles. If that's not great customer service, I'm not sure what is. An overall great experience."

I'm new to using these vehicles (under 5 hours flight time so far) and spent a lot of time deciding on which would be my first. I am extremely pleased I chose this one! The video included in this review has been greatly reduced for posting here but, trust me the 4k30fps original is truly quite spectacular for such a reasonably priced drone. I have found a little forward flight and gentle control movements while maneuvering greatly increases image stability, even in the 6-8 meter per second gusts present during capture.The flight characteristics of this vehicle are intuitive, very tame and highly competent. Mine has exceeded all claims made in the product description and then some. Battery life is terrific and the transmission range is quite frankly amazing. Even with power lines in between and a security system broadcasting nearby on 2.4gHz I can fly out 1000 meters and more. The controls are very, very smooth.This quad-copter is helping me gain skill and confidence. All I could have asked for and more.Thank you Potensic!*Update one year later...This has proven to be an excellent purchase. I have zero complaints and have had absolutely no reason to contact Potensic, for anything other than to give my profound thanks for offering so much quality for so little cost. In fact I have nothing but praise for Potensic and this magnificent little flying machine - with a camera attached!Again many, many thanks."
"Fun  to fly, easy to install, nice bad, good camera. For more serous use, buy the gimbal."
"Bon"
"Easy to use and very well made. well packaged and protected. Thank you. Love this lamp for my computer desk."

"I've been using the Arzroic Tablet Holder Mount with my 6th Gen iPad on my DJI Mini 3 RC-N1 controller for about three months now, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. The build quality is decent for the price, and I've encountered no issues with durability or wear and tear over time. Installation was a breeze, thanks to its clamshell design which simply requires loosening two screws to fit around the controller antenna and then tightening until snug. Once mounted, my iPad felt securely in place, which was a pleasant surprise.The holder significantly enhances my drone flying experience by allowing me to use my iPad's larger screen for a better view of the video output. This improvement makes it much easier to see what I'm filming, which is a big plus. However, it's worth noting that the mount does not come with a cable long enough to connect a larger tablet like the 6th Gen iPad to the controller. I had to purchase a separate cable for this purpose, which was an additional expense.Despite this minor inconvenience, I would still recommend this tablet holder to any drone enthusiast looking for a reliable way to enhance their flying experience with a larger display. Just be prepared to invest in an extra cable if you're using a larger tablet. Overall, I'd rate this product 4 stars for its solid performance and value, with a point deducted for the additional cable requirement."

I was worried about this product being too flimsy and not able to hold a heavy tablet but after using it, I have no complaints it holds The tablet quite easy it doesn’t slip out or fall out Keep the tablet in nice and tight all in all Easy to set up."
"Used with a 10 inch tablet. Mounts easily, keeps the tablet secure, and is compact enough when folded down that it slides into the DJI carry bag no problem. Running a bigger screen is definitely the way to go, though it's advisable to get/make a screen shade too."
"Bought to hold an iPad on my Air 2S and Mini 2 controller.  Couple simple screws to mount the base and ready to go.  At first it was awkward mounting ipad, but it was my fault. After trying different ways of holding the controller extension piece I found the best way for me in seconds. Holding the controller in my left hand and holding iPad horizontally in my right hand I place the iPad under the flip up tab on the mount and push the iPad up, extending the controllers antenna extension, then slip bottom of iPad over the ‘jump’, actually the two rubber stops.  The 3rd and 4th photos illustrate what I tried to type.  Couldn’t find the correct nomenclature.  I hope you get the drift.  Anyway, it is very sturdy and even tho it feels like ipad will snap the piece, it never does.  Been using two of them for months on both drones.  Very good"
"I got the thing on OK. But when I put either of my two tablets, I did not feel secure that it would not drop my tablet if turned the thing slightly. I did like that it stayed with the drone. That it was easy to hold a tablet. I just didn't trust it. Returning. YMMV"
"I took a leap and it paid off. Works great with an iPad."
"Bought this because I was using a 3rd party cable since I accidentally ran over my origional cable.  The 3rd party cable did not work ever, but this OEM cable has worked every time."
"As advertisedWork wellGood price"
"Works exactly as it should.  Fast shipping"
"Very Good Quality"
"its an oem cable at an affordable price. Works as the old one did."
"Same length as the original on my mavic 2."
"It’s works seems to be ok"
"So far everything comes in the box. Inside the camera box are the lanyard & batteries for the camera. And the rest is what the holiday bundle states will have inside. Haven't used the camera but can't wait to use it for some Christmas pictures of my baby. So far this is worth it especially if it comes with extra accessories for the camera."
"My 10-year-old daughter got this for her birthday and she loves it. Granted the film is pretty expensive to buy, but it’s a cool gift that takes me back to the time when we used to use Polaroids."
"We got this for a birthday party gift, and to use at the party. So cute and easy enough for a child to use. So nostalgic and adorable!"
"Holiday packages is good for gift"
"I got this for a gift and LOVED that it comes with everything said on the box!! 🥰"
"Loved the camera however pictures come out darker"

"We had two of these easy to use cameras. The photos come out very well. We also had an album that is set up to quickly slide the photo into a slot and place for a message next to the photo. It was really fun to go thru the photos and album late night, after the wedding events were finished."
"It’s super easy to operate, and the mint green color is adorable. The photos develop quickly, capturing great memories. Perfect for parties or just everyday fun!"
"Bought for my grandaughter and she’s loves it and the case along with it perfect to carry so doesn’t get dropped since on her shoulder tytyty:)"
"Loved it,  hate that it was stolen."
"It won’t ever be something you use all the time. But the design is good and the picture quality is good enough for price point and ease of use. Instant will never be digital and vice versa. Good for parties or making little memories. Cartridges aren’t cheap and only 10 exposures per. But solid for right use."
"Great item that came on time and it works great."
"This camera is the best gift you can give to anyone. The color options are great and it’s definitely worth the money. It is very durable and the shipping was fast.Love how easy it is for anyone to use it. It’s great for capturing in the moment moments. !"
"This camera takes excellent, retro-looking pictures. I love being able to capture moments and have a hard copy to look at. We look at most pics today on an electronic device so it is nice to have a pic to put on display.  The pictures are small but cute. This makes a great gift."
"In a digital age, the charm of instant photography remains unparalleled, and the Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 is a testament to this. Having used it for several events and casual outings, I am excited to delve into what makes this camera a delightful pick for instant photography enthusiasts.**Design and Aesthetics: 4.5/5**The Instax Mini 12 sports a fresh, playful design that's both eye-catching and ergonomic. Available in a variety of colors, it caters to different tastes. Its lightweight and compact nature make it a convenient carry-along, though the plastic build might not appeal to all.**Image Quality and Performance: 4/5**For an instant camera, the Mini 12 offers commendable image quality. The colors are vibrant, and the exposure adjustment works well in various lighting conditions. It might struggle a bit in low light, but that's a common limitation in instant photography. The added selfie mirror is a fun touch for selfie enthusiasts.**Ease of Use: 5/5**This is where the Mini 12 truly shines. Its point-and-shoot simplicity makes it accessible to all ages. The automatic exposure control and flash adjustment are great for beginners, removing the guesswork and making every shot count.**Film Cost and Availability: 3.5/5**The ongoing cost of film packs is a consideration for any instant camera. While the Instax Mini film is widely available, the cost per print might add up for frequent users. However, the unique charm of each printed photo often outweighs this concern.**Battery Life: 4/5**The battery life is impressive, lasting through multiple film packs on a single charge, though this can vary based on usage patterns. The convenience of a rechargeable battery over traditional AA batteries is a definite plus.**Overall: 4.2/5**The Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 is a delightful instant camera that combines style, simplicity, and the joy of instant photography. It's perfect for capturing spontaneous moments, parties, and creating physical keepsakes on the go. Despite the ongoing cost of film, its ease of use and the fun factor make it a great choice for anyone looking to step into the world of instant photography."
"I bought this camera right before my daughters first birthday because I wanted to capture her little moments in a sweet way. I have loved it! The pictures come out great, the camera itself is very pretty, and the case is a wonderful addition. Use is super straight forward. For me personally it was a bit of a splurge but people spend more than this on cameras all the time so it might depend on your situation whether or not it is worth the price"
"Got this camera for a birthday party and it was so much fun! Everyone was obsessed with taking pics, shaking them out, and waiting to see how they’d turn out. It seriously made the night feel way cooler.The case is great for throwing it in your bag without worrying about it getting messed up, and having the extra rolls was a lifesaver. If you want something fun and nostalgic for your next hangout, this camera’s a must!"
"The quality of the body is excellent, it is not hard enough to drop to the floor and wait it will be okay, but enough to keep in bags or something like this. It’s so much simple to use (the start bottom is the lens hahaha). I bought the mint color and it looks pretty nice, is not annoying green. Trust me, you will need more than 40 films, but for the price let’s say it’s just ok. In low light condition it could take the photo out of focus. And the flash is too much for selfies at night."
"Super practical and easy to use.The film don't look so good in daylight (the polaroid is very clear). But I loved it anyway."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I love it ! The color choice the photo album super cute and the extra camera films. It takes cute pic but you definitely have to have good lighting. Value for money is good."
"The camera works absolutely perfectly. Very simple to use, and the picture quality is very good."
"The camera is fun to take pictures on girl's night or date night! The pictures are a great size to include in a greeting card or to put in a scrapbook. It packs easily as well to take it on trips."
"We got this camera for our daughter's 9th birthday and it is perfection! Easy to set up and get started, even comes with batteries! If you are expecting iPhone quality pictures, don't! But that's the fun of this camera...Real pictures being developed right in front of your eyes! Which is totally magical for kids that have ever only known digital technology...And totally nostalgic for us parents that grew up with this! The pics are retro and still good quality. The camera case, stickers, album, and cleaning cloth are all excellent quality. This product came with 60 sheets of film. Great value! The pics print out immediately after snapping the shot and my daughter now truly knows what it means to ""shake it like a polaroid""  lolFantastic product and definitely recommend for kids AND adults!"
"She loved the camera. Took photos all morning. Best part is the photo is tangible!"
"I like how easy it is to change the film! The tiny photo album is perfect"
"Probably a favorite gift for our 15 year old. She carried it around all Christmas weekend getting photos with cousins and friends and putting them in the included album. Lots of fun. Comes with everything you need and lots of film to get started. The photo album, case and stickers are a great bonus!"
"The batteries that this come with doesn't work. Other than that, this is a good product."
"Great starter pack for a gift"
"Kept it along With the guest book for pic perfect msg for birthday boy."
"Love this.  Son has one as well.  Lots of fun for taking pics."
"I recently purchased this Polaroid camera for my bridal, and it was an absolute hit! The camera itself is incredibly cute with a charming retro design that instantly catches the eye. It’s not just a pretty face, though - this little camera performs wonderfully.The instant print feature is fantastic. It takes high-quality pictures and prints them out quickly, making it perfect for capturing spontaneous moments. Our guests had a blast snapping photos and scrapbooking in the guest book! It added a fun, interactive element to the party that everyone enjoyed.Setting it up was a breeze, and the controls are straightforward enough for anyone to use. Even the kids could get in on the action without any hassle. The prints themselves are vibrant and clear, and the small size makes them perfect keepsakes.Overall, I couldn’t be happier with this purchase. It’s not just a camera; it’s a great activity that brings people together and creates lasting memories. Highly recommend for any event or gathering! Definitely worth the price!"
"a very cool retro style camera, it is very convenient to get the finished photo immediately after taking the photo, after waiting a few seconds) I like to take it with me and catch wonderful moments"
"Good bundle and fun product.  Pictures are classic look and won't be sharp (but hopefully that's not why you bought this).  My partner and I use this to log a lot of our hikes and every day cameos."
"I love this instax so much! I hesitated for a long time but I pulled the trigger on getting it because I went to an event states away and I wanted to have physical pictures. It did a great job, as good of quality of Polaroids can be of course. The crossbody strap held up and keeps the camera secure. This was an awesome bundle for the price!"
"This was a great gift for my niece, The only downside is the Camarra would print a lot a blank pictures."
"Works great! Compact and great carry case"
"I gave this as a gift for someones birthday. She loved it and it takes great pictures. Would recommend this for someone who likes to take pictures and get them fast."
"It's amazing, fast printing, great quality, stickers too."
"I loveeeee this camera! I‚Äôve wanted a retro instant camera for a few years and finally decided to buy this one right before a recent vacation. I didn‚Äôt want to be tied to my phone or be tempted to post every moment of my trip on social media so this was a great purchase. The pictures came out amazing and I had a great trip as I was able to be more present than if I was worried about taking pics on my phone constantly."
"This camera is 10/10. I love it because the Polarid is bigger than an average one. Easy to use, have had it for months and haven‚Äôt had any issues."
"it‚Äôs gift for friend she likes it"
"Takes amazing photos and captures the perfect moments ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Did not receive a minimal packet of films as described"
"You Can got a lot of fun with this camera"
"I purchased this camera for my daughter's photo guest book (later this year). I like the square look of the pictures, it is easy to use. I haven't tried the selfie option yet but will prior to the event."
"It's my birthday! It's my birthday!! No for real, it's my birthday and this camera is my present. I've always had a hankering to get a Polaroid camera so I saw this FujiFilm one and thought..must have! I am so glad I did because it's so fun! Now if your looking for high def pics, not for you, and you must not remember the 70s. This is a great little camera and the pictures are just big enough to see and small enough to collect in a small album or post on the fridge like I did with my Luna photo in this review. Go for it! You won't be disappointed! Oh and I highly recommend the rainbow film."
"Loved how easy this was to use and the size of the images. I think these are much nicer and more versatile than the normal instax mini sizing. We‚Äôve had a lot of fun with this camera and I think it makes a super fun gift as well.The pictures sometimes can turn out dark if it‚Äôs too bright so I think it‚Äôs best used in the evening / nighttime where the flash really works well at spotlighting subjects. I also bought the recommended case and the case is really bad so would not recommend that. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great camera and I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase!"
"My girlfriend uses this all the time and loves it"
"It has a lovely classic design, and several features that lets you compose different type of photos. A big advantage this camera has is that because it has memory and is digital, you can take shots and practice your shoots without worrying about running out of Instax film (and money). I love that you can use the instax mini app to print photos from your phone in mini instax film, it has been very handy. You can also customize your prints a bit and change the colors the zoom in/out so that it prints just like you want.A ""downside"" of being digital is that the photos are really good, which takes away some of the ""rustic feel"" that regular instax cameras have. This camera has a filter that imitates that feel a little bit, but it's not a perfect copy. This can be an upside if you want great and clear instax photos, or a downside if the experience you want is those rough colors from regular instax cameras.I recommend this product a lot though, it was praised nonstop by models and photographers when I took it to an event earlier this year. I think the price is an investment for the quality, features, convenience, and not spending money on film when practicing your shoots. 10/10"
"I love this camera! It’s so vintage looking and I’m glad I got the brown instead of the black color. It’s easy to use, it’s light weight and I love that you can choose which pictures to print since the film isn’t cheap. I also like the fact that once you print a picture, you can transfer it to your phone. It’s also cool that the camera also works as an instant printer from your phone so you don’t have to carry a separate instant printer with you. So far I love everything about this camera. My only complaint is that with the camera being expensive, I do wish it came with a lens cap."
"Love all the features to print from my phone and the remote shoot etc. and the old time look is very cool"
"It is so perfect and fun to use. You can connect it to your phone to use it as a preview and use it as a shutter button if placing the camera at a distance. You can edit and crop the photo directly on the camera. Printing made so easy and greatest of all, you can save so many films by picking the perfect photo!"
"It looks like a really nice camera from unboxing it. I turned it on and it had very low battery as expected you should charge it prior to first use. The LCD screen doesn't have the best display, however I wasn’t expecting much from that and it still serves its purpose as it should. Overall this looks like a really good camera and if I come across any issues I’ll be sure to update!"
"I really like the ability to see the pictures before you print them on this polaroid camera. The quality is very good for a polaroid camera. You can also print the same picture multiple times and adjust lighting and different types of lenses. This makes it so much better then the other polaroid cameras I have seen.However:1. when it is very bright outside, even while adjusting brightness settings, it's hard to get a perfect photo. It doesn't do a poor job, but it's quality is much lower in super high brightness.2. When you are in a darker setting, even when you turn off flash it still flashes. The setting doesn't need to be super dark and it happens more often then I would like.Overall, I think it's a really good option for a polaroid camera and much better then cameras that just print immediately and not a ton more expensive then the ones that produce much worse results, but there is some work to be done to improve the camera."
"Love my Instax Mini Evo! I added this camera to journal my other hobby. A quick picture of my work and it goes to my journal! Function is pure and simple as the old Instagram, but the best feauture is that the Mini Evo brings the classic to modern times. This is a hybrid camera that is both digital and analog. The value is saving money on film with being able to select your prints with the use of an internal memory and function with SD card slot.  But wait! There’s more! Bluetooth function lets you send your pictures from your phone to the camera and vice versa! All of this is excellent for me and has inspired me to jump to a new hobby"
"Having a lot of fun with this camera. Very satisfying to print your pictures right away!"
"The Fujifilm Instax Mini EVO Instant Camera is a delightful blend of nostalgia and modern innovation. Here's why I love it:Pros:- Innovative LCD screen for previewing and editing.- Produces sharp, vibrant prints with ease.- Offers digital capture alongside traditional instant printing.- User-friendly design for seamless operation.- Compact and portable for on-the-go use.Cons:- Print cost can add up over time.- Editing options on the LCD screen are somewhat limited.Overall, the Fujifilm Instax Mini EVO Instant Camera is a fantastic blend of modern technology and instant gratification, perfect for capturing and sharing memories in a fun and creative way."
"I've encountered several furniture assembly kits, and have to say I have NEVER been as pleased and gratified with the ease of assembly, clear instructions, and quality of a product as I am with my ODK Computer Desk.  The parts were clearly marked, of good quality, and I was easily able to assemble the desk with no problem.  Plus, it looks terrific.  I really appreciate the care ODK took to ensure their product was of good quality and provided all instructions and materials to make the assembly a breeze - all at a price within my budget!"
"Might be a little short for taller people, but it fits my needs. Fairly easy to put together and it looks great. Fits my laptop and second screen and still has enough room for water bottle, note taking, and a few other knicknacks."
"I bought this desk as a back up desk/sewing table for my daughter. Great size and very sturdy. Had a little trouble putting it together as the instructions weren't great but we got it figured out."
"The desk was packaged very well and fairly simple to put together with no missing parts. The drawers are cloth on the sides but still sturdy. The desk is very stable and could hold a larger tv/monitor on it easily. This was the perfect addition to finish off my guest room. The only thing I didn't care for is the extra holes on the front and it's not necessarily a huge deal but if it came with white caps or plugs to put over the screws or in the extra holes it'd be a tad more visually appealing. (Maybe I can find some) That tiny thing would not deter me from recommending this desk at all!!!"
"I'm impressed. For a piece of furniture from a box, this surprised me, in a good way. The directions were perfect. Easy to understand and the diagrams well drawn. Very user friendly. It's so obvious that this company went the extra mile to make it easier for the consumer to assemble their product! The finished product impresses me too.  Nice and Sturdy! The drawers are cloth with a fabric covered cardboard insert for stability and the drawer fronts are made of thick material, ( probably not solid wood, but what ever wood substitute is used these days), and a handle for each drawer front. The drawers open and close well and softly. When you close the drawer fully, you hear and feel it fit perfectly shut in place. The price is reasonable! I'm highly impressed and plan to buy from this company again!"
"I was happy that this desk is actually exactly as pictured in the product photographs. It was well packaged from the manufacturer. Assembly is easy.Finishes came slightly damaged/scuffed in some places. Some metal parts transitioned from glossy and smooth to coarse and powdery feeling on the ends. Some frame members were not cut square, but it was not noticeable in the assembled product. The holes for the shelves were not drilled on center with one another, so there is an ever so slight lean in three of them. Ultimately, these are things that maybe only I would notice as I'm a quality assurance inspector for a living.Update:Seller is actively committed to customer service and quality products. They reached out to me after I left the review above. While I didn't need anything, I appreciate that they care."
"The screws for installing the center leg post were too short. I had to buy longer ones. Some of the parts were mislabeled. There need to be plugs for the screw holes that are not used on the front legs."
"Good looking table, and easy to set up. Seems sturdy when set up as well. For the price, I think its a great product."
"stylish and simple.  narrow to fit the space."
"Easy to put together, nice size and sturdy."
"I really like this deck; great size and height for the area I needed it. Only thing I don't like is the drawers are like, totes?? Not made of the same material as the rest of the desk. I wish they were. Still like it though."
"Assembled very easy. Quite sturdy!I am not using the 'X' support bars as I'm using it for a nail table but it seems strong enough without. Very nice quality over all :) happy with my purchase for sure.  Just didnt realize that the drawers are fabric. Its ok though theyre good quality. Thanks!"
"I do like this desk. Looks good, sturdy, easy to put together."
"I was looking for a desk for my craft room, that would be sturdy and small enough that it would not take up a lot of space.I ran across this desk. While a little apprehensive about the ""cloth drawers"", I decided to give it a try. I am far from being disappointed! This is one bargain buy! The desk frame is metal, yes, the drawers are cloth, but the heavy cardboard bottom not only gives the drawer its shape, but is quite sturdy. While it probably won't hold a 5 or 10 lb item, it certainly does the job for the average office items. It's lightweight enough that if you need to move it, you can easily pick it up and relocate.  It comes very well packaged, although I had the small computer stand board arrive broken. I have contacted the seller for a replacement. All hardware is included, along with tools to assemble.  The overall desk is sturdy and is well made. The instruction booklet is one of the better written set of instructions I've ever had. There were only a couple of points that I was confused on orientation, but looking ahead in the assembly guide, I was able to choose the correct assembly. This desk comes with 2 size options. The one I chose was the 61"", but this is also available in a 53"" version. There are 4 color options as well, black, oak grey, white, and vintage. The vintage is only available as a 53"".  Overall, this is a great buy, easy to put together, looks great, sturdy, and the price is easy on the budget.I'm considering replacing my present computer desk with one of these. LOVE IT!"
"After browsing for days I finally landed on this puppy and glad I did. I ordered the 61 inch, which has the perfect amount of space for multiple monitors and grad school work. Came quicker than expected, was super easy to assemble (zero alignment issues), and came with extra hardware. This desk is a great value for the price, especially because I bought it on sale for ~$120. Comes with 2 huge shelves, 3 spacious drawers, 3 triple prong outlets, 2 USB outlets, tons of leg room and is sturdy without being too heavy or bulky. Would recommend!"
"This desk was delivered very quickly in less than two days. It was carefully packaged, as the larger wooden parts arrived without any damage, despite my own mishap of letting the box fall over after moving into the house. The instructions were very easy and came with its own set of tools and the best part was it came with an allen key with a large black handle instead of those uncomfortable basic metal keys that strain my hand, making assembly even easier that even my three year was able to assist. Desk was well designed for anyone with a large computer setup or in my case, this was for my son that has a Chromebook hooked to a docking station, but needs extra desk space for reading and homework, and Lego building. I loved that there were minimal parts to assemble. My son loves his new desk, and soft drawers were a big selling point for me as he is constantly slamming drawers shut so now he can do so with minimal noise.  The only issue I had, otherwise I would have rated this five stars was that the fabric drawers had a slight chemical small, but I am used to that from other Amazon purchases so a couple sprays of febreeze and gain and the smell dissipated overnight. Overall very happy with my purchase."
"I recently set up the AODK 61-Inch L Desk, and it’s been perfect as a dual-purpose desk for both gaming and work. The spacious design easily fits my monitor, gaming setup, and work laptop with room to spare. The built-in drawers are a great addition, helping keep everything organized. One standout feature is the power extension setup on the desk—it’s so convenient for plugging in my phone, headset, and laptop without needing extra cords hanging around.The only minor drawback is that the desktop can smudge, especially with fingerprints, but using a microfiber towel makes it easy to keep it clean. I wasn’t comfortable with it at first until i got an office chair that changes heights cause the desk is an inch or two too tall but it’s comfy and looks great. Overall, this desk has been a fantastic upgrade for my setup! BTW the drawers are felt :) they still work tho they sometimes droop when you open them too far out if they are heavy."
"I actually love this desk. It was fairly easy to put together. It works great in my office with my desktop computer and 2 printers. It's sturdy and pretty nice. I thought it was going to be cheaply made at first but I love it. The drawers are not what I expected, but even they are working out good."
"For the cost this desk is a great value. There are a lot of parts to assemble. Looks great, sturdy and fit my office exactly as measured"
"Okay, so, it took 3 hours to set this up with 2 people. It was easy enough to assemble I suppose, but the figures/images are mirrored (at least for the right-side, not sure about left side instructions)  and the instructions don't make much intuitive sense (diagrams are confusing). Originally I wanted a right-sided desk. So we followed the right sided desk instructions. However, It ended up as a left sided desk.  Thankfully it still fit in my space,  we just had to put it against a different wall. But like,  the instructions were utterly terrible. We eventually held the right sided instructions up in the mirror and it appeared correct that way,  lol... but we didn't read the instructions through a mirror until we were on like, step 9 (out of 13). HOWEVER, the desk works and looks GREAT... if you can figure out how to assemble it correctly. There was some extra hardware included."
"This desk is great, very easy to assemble. It fits perfectly where I needed it.  Sturdy and great quality for a low cost."
"I ordered this at 47"" Vintage finish, on sale for $59, and I didn't notice until after that it was only 19"" deep(front to back). That's my mistake for not checking. The product looks amazing. Arrived in perfect shape despite a hole in the box (probably my delivery driver). The table top has a nice smooth finish, all the parts were ready to go and easy to assemble, even if you're alone, although a second person helps a lot though. I decided to keep it because it's a great-looking and space-saving surface to use even if I don't use it for a computer desk. I'm still ambivalent on that, because of one thing-the top piece is rather flexible, even with the included brace underneath of it. All the legs and the brace are hollow aluminum, I believe, as I dented some of them just tightening up screws. It keeps the item very light-weight though, probably less than 20lbs. If I was the seller I would look at a stiffer cross-brace underneath the top. I may add a solid board, personally. Regardless, it's a good desk and a nice fit for a slim area. I would personally recommend this as the L-shape addition or multi-use desk, feels a bit too slim for heavy pc gaming/equipment. Would probably be great for a laptop though, or a one-monitor setup with the tower on the edge over a leg5 stars because despite being kind of flimsy even with the brace, and legs are a bit too easy to bend, desk has a great price (on sale $30 off at least), great appearance, and comes in multiple sizes for different usages."
"We bought this desk to have in our spare room. It worked great for my son who stayed with us for a month.  He used it every day to have his laptop and 2nd monitor set up on.  The hook was handy to hold his headset.  It's sturdy enough for daily use but don't put anything too heavy on it.  It suits our needs perfectly."
"A pretty good desk for about 30$, simple to assemble. Nothing fancy but works well enough"
"I love this table every easy to install.. it’s not heavy but very sturdy, well worth the money. I love that it’s real wood"
"Perfect size for my home office. Can fit my monitor and keyboard easily. Good size for small places. Easy to put together. Great buy for the price."
"Let me share a little cautionary tale with you. When I got this computer desk, I was so eager to set it up that I decided to take a little shortcut. The instructions called for attaching these beams that cross between the legs, but I thought, “Pfft, how important could those be?” Spoiler alert: They’re *really* important.I happily ignored them, thinking I’d save a few minutes. Big mistake. Huge. Fast forward to me trying to type, and suddenly it felt like I was on a boat in the middle of a storm. The desk started wobbling with every keystroke, and let’s just say, it made writing an email feel like a high-stakes balancing act.So, take it from me—those beams are there for a reason. Don’t skip them unless you’re looking to turn your workday into a shaky adventure. Once I grudgingly went back and attached them, the desk turned into the solid, reliable piece of furniture it was always meant to be.Overall, this desk is great—plenty of space, nice design, and when assembled *correctly*, it’s sturdy as a rock. Just don’t be like me and try to cut corners. Trust the process, and you’ll end up with a fantastic desk that doesn’t double as a seesaw."
"Very nice and basic desk that is extremely easy to put together."
"Delivery was good, item assembly was good, height, width and length were good. However, my 14 y.o. son leans on everything. He's 110 lbs. and while getting up from the table it cracked close to the right edged corner near the attaching screw points.So now we don't darn place anything like my children gaming computers/ laptops on the top of the other two tables I had bought for this purpose. I think we'll will stick with solid wood or possible thicker acrylic made tables. I gave it 3 stars simple because of the points mentioned above."
"As expected"
"Took a bit longer to assemble but worth it! Definitely good value for the money."

"This desk great! The directions were extremely easy to follow and made for a very easy assemble. I needed a desk for my work from home job and my puzzle hobby, and this is just what I need. Not wide enough for larger puzzles, but I knew that before purchasing. I recommend to anyone looking for an affordable, well made desk."
"Update: Customer service reached out to me and was eager to work with me to fix my issues. They were extremely helpful and I am now totally satisfied with the resolution options provided and the steps they have been willing to undertake in order to fix the issues. This, in my opinion, has totally been worth adding a couple stars back to their rating based on how professionally they handled the situation.The desk is actually pretty sturdy considering its smaller size. The storage for this size desk is impressive and setup wasn't difficult at all. However, there are certainly some negatives worth discussing. Firstly, the instructions for building the desk are sufficient but would definitely benefit from a bit more clarity, both in terms of pictures shown as well as descriptions provided. The built-in power outlet is a nice feature but the outlets are just a bit too close together so if plugging in any plug which is just a bit wider than normal, then the outlet next to it will be obstructed. The largest upset for me with this whole desk setup has been the quality. For a brand new desk, I expect the components to be free of cracks, scratches, dirt, and poor quality. When removing the different pieces from the packaging, one piece has a crack in it and a couple pieces appear to be ""stained"" with dirt which I have been unable to successfully clean. Being brand new, these quality issues simply aren't acceptable. I understand that this is more of a ""budget"" desk, but quality is still lacking a bit for a supposedly unused item. Lastly. the corner of the desk by my left elbow (inner part of the L-shape extension) does not have a clean transition with the veneer which causes a sharp corner. The desk has potential and I think deserves a bit higher than 2-stars, however 3-stars just seems to high considering these quality issues for a brand new product. It sucks to get a new item that starts off damaged from day 1 :("
"This looks really good in my room. I am an online college student. When I say these directions were well thought out, these directions made it so easy to put together. It was a picture guide with both options to build available. There were letters on the materials and a bag of screws and tools with numbers on them to use for what step you were working on. As long as you put the coinciding piece of the desk with the numbered nail or screw, that was it!! I didn‚Äôt need something big, but I appreciate the extra ‚ÄúL‚Äù space on the side for a book or somewhere to sit my extra stuff. The corners of the top of the desk are a little sharp so I would suggest the little corner pieces of plastic that come with the desk to save your arms from getting scratched. I‚Äôve done that already but hadn‚Äôt thrown the box away yet so I put them on there. I was pleasantly surprised at just how practical it is. It‚Äôs really cute and the price point was nice as well. My new desk is really nice. I like it a lot."
"This desk is solid and the perfect size for where I put it in my home. The drawers hold plenty of paperwork and desktop accessories that I don't want out all the time, and the two shelves I use for candles (not burning them there), a pen cup, etc. The power connector on top is out of the way and with 3 plugs and 2 USB ports perfectly fits my needs and convenience."
"This desk is a good size and pretty sturdy. Took two people to set it up and the directions are just ok. The main desk panel came stained and it literally will not come off. Didn‚Äôt see it till we got to the end unfortunately and not worth dismantling, but that and the chipped drawer bring the rating way down. This was cheaper but not cheap cheap. I expected better."
"I've used high-end electric desks at work, and since you typically get what you pay for, I was a bit wary of buying one for home that was so relatively inexpensive. But overall the reviews were positive enough (especially regarding customer service) and there were some good tips regarding assembly, so I figured it was worth the risk.Both boxes arrived with the contents in perfect condition: the boxes used very thick, heavy cardboard, and the corner protectors on the desktop were made of a very dense rubber. I've unpacked a lot of furniture (assembling desks for classrooms and computer labs), and the packaging for this desk puts many so-called ""commercial"" products to shame. Any damage that might occur would be due to careless shipping and handling - not how the factory packed it.Assembling the desk was straightforward enough, although I've put together enough of this sort of furniture over the years that there weren't any surprises. Just take your time, follow the steps, and you'll be fine. This can be assembled by one person, but a second set of hands will make things easier.All of the pre-drilled holes lined up where they were supposed to. One assembly tip: line up one of the end holes in a leg with its corresponding hole in the desktop, and drop a thin nail into the hole to give it something to pivot around. Then with that hole aligned, line up each of the other holes, again dropping a thin nail into each one until they're all aligned. Then drive the screws, replacing each nail, one at a time. No guesswork, no misaligned screws, no do-overs.The only two pilot holes I had to add were for the center crossbar, so you will need a drill and a small bit (a hand drill or pin vise would work for this). For driving all of the screws I used a hand screwdriver, so I wouldn't run the risk of stripping out the particle board.Everything went together very nicely. There were no stripped threads or alignment issues. Overall, I felt the quality of the desk and and the fit and finish of the parts were excellent and exceeded my expectations.The motor operates pretty quietly, and raises and lowers the desk just fine, even with a bunch of stuff piled on top of it (I don't plan on testing what its limits are - it holds what I need). I had an error message pop up on the controller once when I attempted to recall a saved height, but unplugging the desk from power and reconnecting it resolved that. No issues since.The desk is solid and stable. At its higher settings it will sway a little bit when leaned on, but that's just physics at work - if you need something that's really solid at full height, get something with four legs instead of two.The only (minor) gripe that I have is that the cords could be a bit longer: the one for the control panel so you could reposition it if you needed to; and the power cord which barely reaches the width of the desk.I'm very pleased with this purchase. It met my budget, and exceeded my expectations. It's a good-looking, solid, quality desk. Hopefully it'll hold up over time - but so far, so good!"
"Desk was on sale and bought the Maple 55 inch.Ships in two shipments, the top and the motorized bottom.Not too bad to put together. Instructions are clear, however it does say to adjust the crossbar early on in instructions. But you aren't going to be able to do that until you are mounting to the top so you can line the holes up. So I would just ignore that step or make it a little wider to give you some working room.Once it comes time to mount the top  do one screw top/bottom on one side. Then loosen the crossbar and transmission rod and extend until until you lined up the other side with the holes.  Once all screwed in tighten the rod and crossbar.One thing I think would have helped was a guide on where the center of the crossbar extension was so you could extend it in a balanced way. I just eyeballed it. Most the weight is going to go to the legs anyway so not concerned.As far as predrilled holes go, they lined up perfectly on left/right side. There is no predrilled holes for the crossbar however you don't need a drill the wood is soft enough to just screw into with a bit of force.Theres also no predrilled hole for the back of the up/down switch but again not a problem. Theres plenty of holes to position the switch where you want (though it must be on the right side of the desk near the motor since the cords aren't that long).One other nitpick is the bracket that holds the power adapter doesn't lock into place. It just slides around freely. Being nitpicky though its not a functional problem.All pieces were there. The top looks really nice but it isn't heavy enough to be solid maple. But all put together the desk has good weight and very sturdy. Motor works well, I actually didn't even buy it for being a standing desk so thats a bonus. It was a good price even if it didn't have that feature.Pros:-sturdy and good weight to it-motor is enough to do the job.-not bad to put together. No frustrating moments. Takes about an hour. Only need a sturdy philips screwdriver no drill needed.-top is one solid piece-its deep! Most cheaper desks are 20-24 inches. 28 inches is a very noticeable difference.-good price-the desk gets very tall, I was surprised. I am 6'2 and it got more than tall enough for me.Cons-couple of nitpicks about instructionsWell see how long it lasts but so far am satisfied."
"This desk is a great value. I purchase two because we replaced our at home work station with these desk.It is great to alternate between sitting and standing. The motor is pretty quiet and the movement is very smooth going up and down.I have a laptop, monitor, some notebooks, and some charging dock on my desk and there is still plenty of space and the motor handles the weight well. The desk feels sturdy even when I lean my arms on the desk while in the standing position."
"I bought this few weeks ago and it's working great. The instrcutions to assemble this desk is very easy to follow. Nice and sturdy desk. I would recommend this product. In fact, I recommended to one of my friend and he also bought it. Good one for that discounted price."

"Good product"
"I checked reviews before buying this desk, because it is a lot cheaper than I can get locally and I wondered about the quality. I agree with reviewers who like it. It was pretty easy to assemble, and the instructions are a lot better than I'd get from Ikea. I didn't attach the hooks because I don't need them.I suggest testing the mechanism before you install the baffle plates and turn the desk the right way up. I didn't, and had to turn it over again and remove the baffle plates to fix the mechanism, because I had not pushed the rod properly into the motor and only one leg was moving.All in all, a nice looking and well built riser desk at a good price."
"Does it have all the bells and whistles? No, but it has much more than some at half the price. In addition to those little touches like the side hook and collapsible organizer, everything else from packaging to the quality of material and even assembly were easy and stress free. The legs of the table are a thin metal making them lightweight and more modern, the tabletop is clearly cheaper material with a painted varnish in the gray that I chose, but it still feels nice and sturdy, as individual pieces and once they're all put together.The box came and actually showed the best way to unpack, inside it was packed well to the point where even though I used the box cutter to open it, I did not have to worry about scratching the table surface. I unpacked everything, the instructions were there And we're very straightforward. The pictures said everything it had the list of things that we needed laid out, And because of the easy way everything was laid out and explained, I had this put together in 35 minutes (though probably would have been 25 had on it been constantly distracted by my nosy dog lol).I had to pick this up and move it to the room it was going in (in part because there's no room to build it in that room), but the desk was lightweight but still sturdy and fit perfectly in the space I needed. I haven't piled anything heavy on the desk yet, so I can't speak to durability and the promised weight of what I believe was 110lb that it's supposed to be able to hold, but it feels really solid and it looks really nice in the space I chose. I don't know if I'll ever actually end up testing out the weight considering what I plan on using this desk for, but I think it's worth the price for sure, I think I paid $50 and it's a much better quality than some stuff I bought here on Amazon for $20-$40 more. There's definitely nicer things on Amazon, but between how sleek and modern it looks, the price and, depending on what you're using it for, I think this is well worth the choice."
"I recently purchased the ODK 63-inch Super Large Computer Writing Desk for my home office, and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. This desk offers a perfect blend of aesthetics, functionality, and convenience, making it an ideal choice for both gaming and professional work.Assembly:The assembly process was a breeze, taking me approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. The instructions provided were crystal clear, with parts well-marked using both letters and numbers. This made it easy to identify and match the components, ensuring a smooth assembly experience. I appreciated the inclusion of one extra piece for each screw and an additional foot pad, showcasing the manufacturer's attention to detail.Design:The vintage design of the desk caught my eye, and I must say it looks even better in person. The color options available are a nice touch, allowing customers to choose a style that suits their preferences. The desk is spacious, providing plenty of room for a dual-monitor setup, and it exudes a sturdy and reliable build.Functionality:One standout feature is the convenient storage bag on the side, offering a handy solution for keeping essentials within arm's reach. The addition of a headphone hook is a thoughtful touch, keeping my workspace organized and clutter-free. The desk's overall quality is evident, and it provides a stable platform for both work and gaming. The ODK 63-inch Super Large Computer Writing Desk exceeded my expectations in terms of design, ease of assembly, and functionality. It's a fantastic investment for anyone looking to upgrade their home office or gaming setup. The vintage aesthetic, combined with practical features like the storage bag and headphone hook, make this desk a five-star choice in my book. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and stylish workspace."
"For under $100 this desk is pretty good. It’s great if you need to save space but want a nice small desk for two monitors. I purchased the 48 inch version and the two monitors in the photo are both 27” curved so they are a bit large for this desk. The desk is sturdy and was super quick to install.If you’re going to use two monitors on this desk I would recommend getting two 24” displays. If you get two 27” displays like I did make sure to use a monitor stand that can bring the monitors close together or put one vertically otherwise one monitor will slightly be off the desk. However if you don’t mind the look of one monitor going past the desk length then it’s great."
"I bought this desk for my living room so I had a place to keep my laptop and a few notebooks.  It's the perfect size, looks really nice and minimalist, and is great for everyday use.  The side pouch holds a large notebook, my big happy planner, and usually a stack of mail very easily.  The top of the desk has my pencil holder, laptop, and a desk lamp and still has room for my notebook and my cup of coffee.  The assembly is very quick and easy as well.  Definitely recommend!"
"Sturdy desk. It was easy to put together and I have used it many times over the nearly 2 years that I have had this desk. Worth the money and a solid desk. Its not heavy, so its perfect to move around as needed for my laptop. Love!"
"Perfect for my combo office-guest room. Very open design so, though it’s a big desk, it doesn’t look overwhelming in a room that also has a full-sized bed, a file cabinet, and a bookshelf. I love the marbled look of the top. It has a mat finish with just a little texture to it, so it’s not shiny or slippery, but is still smooth enough to use as a writing surface. Super easy to put together solo. It came with 2 allen wrenches (brilliant if you’re working with a partner on assembly) and extra parts. You’ll see in the pic that I put the hook on to face under the desk and use it to keep my surge protector/power strip and cords off the floor. And bonus, it got here about a week sooner than I expected! (3d vs 7-10 that was estimated.) I’m totally satisfied with this purchase."
"I was very pleasantly surprised how good quality this desk! Super easy to put together, strong structure, and nice looking! Would recommend as the perfect desk for small areas! Love the size organizer, which you can put on either side!"
"great to work, eat  or read table for all. It this one purchased for top  elderly as a table for her recliner.Simple assembly even for me as 81 yr old."
"I bought this desk to match the rest of my room with the gold and white. Very hard to find a decent desk with those colours in this price range.It was easy to install and the table top is more solid than I was expecting, but the legs are very thin compared to the photo online. Only downside."
"I am so happy with this purchase and can‚Äôt wait to get my gaming pc set up!! First shipping was not too bad‚Ä¶.when I got the desk the packaging was high quality so I didn‚Äôt have a million little white styrofoam balls all over the room, they even tied a red string to the tool/screw kit so it was easy to spot. They even had removable protectors on the corners of the table tops‚Ä¶.Putting it together was a breeze super easy and concise directions everything needed to put together the desk was included. It‚Äôs sturdy, clean and esthetically pleasing. The size is perfect for my space not too big and bulk but big enough for me to work and play ‚Ä¶.Would make this purchase over a million times again highly recommend!!!"
"I did this for my son‚Äôs set up and it fits perfectly in his room and is not too difficult to install. It‚Äôs also very good for its price.Highly recommended."
"It is such an ideal desk for my room and it looks so clean, i can imagine the other colors coming in looking nicer, especially the white one.I did see other reviews w people getting it shipped broken and or chipped but this came perfectly. (now this doesn't speak for everyone but i was fortunate to have it not shipped broken)The set up in all reality should be around the 45 and 1 hr 30 mark. it took me 1hr to set up only due to me having to repeat procedures that i just didn‚Äôt read properly.now of course, i can‚Äôt mention durability hence me just barely getting it yesterday but for the time being, this look really sturdy and looks like it can carry much, the TV is really out of place and also overboard for weight, so i will eventually replace this with a 24 inch monitor and a new kb+m just to make it look much better.The setup was allot easier than i made it out to be to begin w/ the tools were in the bag w the assorted number and pieces.the pocket compartment is the most underrated  thing with this desk, It‚Äôs beautiful for storing anything without you having to put it on the desk and making the desk look ugly and unorganized. with the pocket, it just looks so nice and you can sort really anything in there. I have a lot of controllers, have a lot of cords in there and it‚Äôs sorted really well, so I feel like if you really wanted to get this and if you really feel like you‚Äôre in need for a L-shaped desk especially for $70, I feel like this is really good I would recommend this to anyone else who are on a budget and are trying to make a set up of some type of gaming or maybe just need it for work.reason that I bought this was due to me wanting to play my video games without me having to move to a different place in my room or maybe having to even like use a book bag or a textbook for me being able to use my notebook for writing or even my school computer.this is just nice, but it is not ideal to have a TV of my size like you can see picture in the review on this because it really does take up most of the room and most weight so I am, again, as I said, on the lookout for a maybe 24 inch monitor, 24 inch TV, whatever it may be. I am going to try to look for it and then I‚Äôm going to be trying to get every other thing to make this L-shaped desk look a lot cleaner."
"I recently set up this desk in my home office, and I‚Äôm pleased with it. The modern design fits perfectly with my decor, and the ability to assemble it as either L-shaped or U-shaped is a huge plus. It was pretty easy to put together, though I did spend about a few hours on it.The desk feels sturdy, and the side storage bag is great for keeping my accessories organized. One minor issue is that the screws may fall apart from time to time, so you might need to check them occasionally. Other than that, it‚Äôs been a solid buy with plenty of room for my computer and other gear. Recommend it for those looking for a stylish and functional desk on a budget!"
"This desk is pretty solid, it took just enough space in my corner of the room. It was easy to build but was difficult doing it by myself. It is very light to pick up and move around your room if you want to change up places. It‚Äôs good. üëç"
"I like that this fits perfectly in the corner of the room I chose so I can work comfortably from home. Didn‚Äôt take long to assemble. Only took 30 minutes. For the price, I believe it‚Äôs well worth it. It‚Äôs not heavy and weighs less than 40lbs. So it‚Äôs easy to carry throughout the home if you wanted to switch things up a bit. It also arrived a couple days earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. For size reference I have x2 27‚Äù monitors set up comfortable enough for me to have room to work and my cats to sit and watch as they please. All in all, I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase."
"The photos and illustrations of this desk make it look bigger than it actually is.  I think the best candidate to use this desk is someone with not much stuff to place onto it in a very neat, straight-forward setup, not someone who expects to be able to ""spread out"" and be a little messy.  For someone like me, with a long history of laying out two folding tables in an ""L"" shape to use as a ""virtual desk"", a work surface this small seriously won't do.  What makes it worse, assembly is a pretty big process, making it especially daunting if at the end, one realizes the desk is not a fit.  The instructions SHOULD start with a ""quick start"" section giving the reader a choice of places to begin reading based on the desired desk orientation.  Instead, an addendum showing how to orient the desk the ""other"" way follows the full set of instructions on how to set it up the ""first"" way.  Backtracking to the decision point is a pretty big chore after completing assembly and deciding to switch.  For me, I had twice the chore, when I realized I needed to disassemble and re-pack the desk kit into its tiny shipping box.  I've moved onto a larger, simpler to assemble desk, which seems a much better fit for me."
"This desk was super easy for me to put together by myself with the included tools. The instructions were pretty clear and easy to follow, so as long as you pay attention to what direction things go, assembly should be a breeze. It also only took about 30-40 minutes to put together.Now that it is all assembled, I love it! It feels pretty sturdy and it looks really nice! Conveniently, the finish also matches some monitor stands I already had, so that's a bonus.Overall, this is a very nice looking, easy to assemble, and inexpensive desk."
"The instructions were easy to follow, the desk is sturdy, and it looks exactly as advertised."
"Fairly easy to build, best of all very sturdy. Plenty of space for workflow."
"This is a good choice for a decent corner desk. Quality matches price."
"My husband and I ordered two of these and they were both delivered so quickly and in two medium size boxes with all the pieces needed and instructions. Super easy to put together! Looks great in our game room! Looks just like the pictures"
"I bought this for my wife's home office. As a light-duty desk it is perfect.Some caveats... This is NOT fine furniture made of 1"" hardwood.  It does NOT have heavy duty hardware and structural members. If you want to use this roughly, you should plan on buying used and/or paying a LOT more.But for around $90 this is well-designed, well-made, fairly easy to assemble, and seems like it will stand up to light-to-medium duty for many years.Assembly:Parts are all clearly marked, including bolts. All nuts are already embedded in the wood, so you just line up the metal, and insert the supplied bolts. There are very few written directions, but there are about 6 steps of very clear pictures that need to be followed. It took me about 45 minutes by myself (not working very hard). I had NO problems with part alignment as another user suggested - my guess is they didn't follow instructions.The only suggestion I would make is to put in all the bolts hand tight first, then when everything is adjusted, gently tighten all the bolts.Some things I particularly liked:Parts and bolts were clearly marked.Clear pictures.Single-tool assembly (an Allen wrench) and they provided three of them!All bolts were separately packaged, with correct count.They even went the extra mile and enclosed a bag that contained one extra tool, one extra of each size of bolt, and one extra foot.What didn't I like?Really nothing. I might wish for something a bit more heavy-duty, but for $90 I think I got more than what I paid for.It was a bargain. My wife loves it!"
"loved everything about this desk, best of all took me 1 hr to build alone and set up"
"Not as described.  Very cheaply made.  Was missing screws. I'm sure my husband can fix it up but save your money.  Very disappointed.  I bought two of them !  Too expensive for what they are."
"I had to review this product because the reviews were mixed and almost turned me off from ordering these pieces.  I'm so glad I didn't!  The desk was super easy to assemble (by myself) and very sturdy and nice looking.  I may get another one.  The filing cabinet was a bit more tricky, but after a helpful call to the Tribesman customer center, I was directed to a very helpful video that quickly answered my question and I was able to continue assembling the cabinet (by myself) with little issue.  Note, the directions only have pictures so it was great that there was a video available.  All-in-all, even though it took me nearly all day to put the pieces together, I would definitely buy this product again.  This is probably the first time that all of the holes lined up properly and I had all the pieces."
"The two pieces--the desk and the lateral file cabinet--are quite different.  The desk rates 5 stars, but I have dropped my overall review by a star because of the lateral file cabinet.  I'd still buy it, but see below for more details.First, the desk is extremely solid, and well packaged--maybe even over-packaged, considering it's mostly steel and almost impossible to damage.  It went together easily, and looks good.Second, the lateral piece.  This is made entirely of pressed wood, and as such is less sturdy.  It's well made, but in my experience pressed wood can develop issues with the fasteners.  While it was thoroughly packed in Styrofoam, one piece arrived damaged: There was minor (really cosmetic) damage to one corner, but more importantly the rail (that the drawer slides on) had broken entirely off.  I wrote to customer service, expecting they would ship a new piece; instead, they suggested I repair it, and offered a hefty partial refund if I would do that.  When I got it in my shop, I realized that all three screws holding the rail had pulled out, leaving holes in the pressed board that would not reliably hold the screws.  I went ahead and put those screws back in, but used wood glue to give it more strength.  I then realized that there were additional holes in the rail, so I drilled small holes in the pressed board and used three more #6 screws there.  I am confident this will hold up, and the partial refund was nice.The instructions for assembling the desk were great; not so the instructions for assembling the lateral piece.  Here are notes I made as I went along, keyed to the steps in the instructions.  Some are probably obvious, but just in case.Pieces W-3 are in a plastic bag.  A few of them somehow locked together during shipment (see my photo), and were difficult to separate.  I found that a screw driver in each piece was needed to separate them.Pieces W-5 are shown in the parts diagram but are not mentioned in the instructions, and are not needed.  I think they were for the handles, but the handles come in a bag with their own screws.2. Make sure piece #4 is lined up with the front of piece #1, and does not cover the groove at the back of #1 (it's possible to get #4 backwards).  Also, pieces W-2 go into *both* sides of piece #4, unlike the instructions which show W-2 on only one side.  Screw these pieces in evenly on the two sides (it's possible to screw one side in too far, then the other won't go in far enough).  Insert these screws *before* inserting piece #3 (pieces 2 and 4 will tilt far enough to fit #3 in, provided you insert the posts on one side of piece #3 before trying to line up the other side).3. Again, pieces W-2 go on *both* sides of piece 5, and make sure the front of #5 lines up with the front of #1.5. Make sure piece #8 goes *all* the way down in the groove in piece #1, or you'll have difficulty later.6. It's unclear from the diagram, but piece #16 fits along almost the entire length of the lower and upper pieces #8.7. There are no pre-drilled holes for the screws, which is why my caution at step 5.  Best to ensure that both #8 pieces are down as far as they can go before using the screws.  The top #8 should stick up about 1/4"" over pieces 2, 4, 5 and 7.8. There's a lot to line up here: not only the W-2 pieces sticking up, but also piece #8 has to go into the groove in the bottom of #9 all the way across.  Easiest is to line up all the W-2s, then slightly screw in the W-3s at the front, then make sure #8 is in the groove before screwing in the back W-3s.10. The instructions don't mention attaching the handles, although I guess it's obvious.  However, the screws that hold the handles on are slightly too long.  I used washers on the inside to make up the difference.In the end, everything went together.  There are a few extra screws and stuff (in addition to the above-mentioned W-5s), which is nice.  The result looks nice, the desk is sturdy, and the lateral file cabinet rolls easily (even on a rug)."
"I like the finished product.  Wish there was a video guide or better instructions for the cabinet.  Took me about 5 to 6 hrs.  Few extra screws included. Desk and file cabinet was two separate shipments which I wasnt originally told.  I would deduct a star but my wife loves it. Seems to be good value and quality."
"Great desk with solid construction. Got this for wifey, and since she is shorter, she needed a lower desk.  This worked perfectly.FYI - there are lots of pieces to put this together."
"This desk looks as advertised- nice and sleek. It’s a little smaller than anticipated but mostly because my computer monitor is much larger than pictured, and I transitioned from a larger desk to this. It will definitely work for the space and again, looks nice. I’ve received several compliments already. I will say though, for someone who is not a builder of any sort, it was not easy to put together. I understood the direction fine, however there was a ton of screws that needed to be screwed in and no holes to help place them. If I was more patient, I would have let someone more experienced put it together for me."
"Very disappointing. The included instructions do not match the pieces and when you finally figure out how to assemble it you will be left with many parts. It hardly resembles the photos and description provided.It comes in two heavy boxes. We opted to return the desk and while the request was approved we were sent a single return label using the US Postal Service, without postage. The USPS would not take it due to the weight and there was only one label for two boxes.When we originally called AZ to intervene, we were told they would arrange with the seller to pick it up and provide the correct UPS labels.we were expected to hear from someone within 72 hours. 96 hours later we had to call AZ again who told us the China based company had not responded and our only option was to arrange with UPS to pick it up and provide AZ with the receipt at which time AZ would reimburse us for the shipping.If you enjoy cheap, poorly made furniture that comes at a premium price - this item is for you.Us… we ordered online from IKEA and the desk was less expensive and beautifully made…. And more importantly, the instructions matched the parts perfectly."
"Very nice desk but assembly instructions were missing from box."
"Arrived on time, good value for the money, easy to assemble, good quality"
"This is just what I needed for my daily work from home desk. I work for a busy insurance company and we work remotely. This desk hits everything I need and more! Easy to put together. My 8 year old granddaughter and I put it together ourselves.  Plenty of room, I bought the 48 inch desk. I have 3 very large monitors and a large laptop. I still have plenty of space. It comes with wire connectors that are amazing and hold everything in one place! Motor is super quiet and has preset buttons as well. Great find, great price well worth the time and price. I spent  100.00 on this beauty and would do it again. Highly recommended."
"Assembly: the instructions are easy to follow, which made putting the table together a breeze.Looks: The table looks great; I like the rustic brown color that I got. I think it is well made. The tiny gap in the middle, because the top came in two pieces, does not bother me. I think it adds to the aesthetics. Lol.Functionality: Height adjustments are very nice. You can save four different height settings. The motor runs smoothly, and the noise is very minimal."
"I needed an adjustable desk but never bought one before. This works perfectly in both sitting/standing configurations and raises/lowers in seconds to the desired height. It was easy to build too. I wish the motor had a straight 3-prong plug-in but I won't ding it for that. I'm very happy with this purchase."
"The installation instructions could be more detailed but you can manage, it's simple. Durable and have purchased a second one. One thing is that you need a phillips screw driver, not provided with the package. There is a small tool for some screws but you need a screw driver to complete the set up.The deliver was fast as indicated in the purchase. Overall happy and recommend the product."
"I like the wood grain color of the table,Very sturdy and durable"
"This desk was very easy to assemble and is very sturdy for the price point! Wouldn’t go back to not having it that’s for sure! Works great with my walking pad!"
"I wanted a sit-stand desk for home use. After researching, I chose this one. The package arrived damaged, as the desk is heavy, but all parts were present. I put the desk together - took a couple of hours. The desk portion is fiberboard. It comes with a plastic cable-holder for under the desk that is attached using three screws. That did not work - all three screws broke the fiberboard - it just flaked off. The electrical system works, instructions were adequate. It supports two monitors, keyboard and mouse, and the powerstrip-surge protector. I placed the laptop on a file cabinet next to it, and checked to make sure the cords were adequate and didn't get trapped. Not perfect, but functional."
"This is a 3 Star quality table.  It goes up and down, no worries.  Have been using it with a heavy monitor and laptop for a few weeks.  Only issue is the monitor arm is clamped on the back table top and it is now curving due to the stress of holding the monitor in position.  I am guessing that 3/4"" Plywood is in my future to replace this thin, cheap particle board.  If you want a basic standing desk and are not planning to put a monitor arm on it, this is a great buy, especially at this price.  Got what I expected, content buyer."
"It takes a little while to put together, but clear instructions,and plenty of hardware. Easy to assemble. Looks great and functions just aswell."
"This desk assembles easily and is sturdy.  Really like the extra outlet on the desk. The design is perfect for right handed users.  The extra file cabinet on wheels is a great idea."
"I was back and forth about getting this desk! I’m so glad I did! It’s very sturdy and well built! It’s exactly what I needed for my work at home job and I have plenty of space! The price was great too!"
"I’m happy with the desk. It’s definitely an upgrade from my last desk I had. It was also easy to put together.  instructions is very clear and even breaks down for both right side and left side setup."
"I have two similar desks and this one is 10x better. Super stable, sucks to put together but wasn’t bad"
"All hardware provided for assembly was provided + spare hardware, very easy to assemble as the assembly manual is well written and includes many photos and parts numbers showing the hardware needed and location"
"Desk came in without damage and was easy to install. Directions were very clear. It is also very strudy and doesnt look cheap either."
"This is a great desk. Easy to put together and feels very sturdy. It has adjustable feet so you can level it to the floor so it dosent wobble. It looks great and the leds are very bright. Fit in the space I had designated for it perfectly. And was the best price I could find for a desk with this many features."
"Never saw myself spending as much as I did on this desk! Worth it, especially for the quality of it.The set up did take way longer than expected, but even after reading the reviews I was determined to beat it (4 hours by myself). It’s pretty straight forward though you have to be careful with all the different holes in the bars and make sure they are facing the right way, mostly so you don’t have to go back after you realized you made a mistake. Thankfully, I only had one mishap.It is also a hardy desk, I keep my ten gallon fish tank and tv plus a whole bunch of other stuff on it and there doesn't seem to be any concern of breakage.I love every bit of this desk and how well everything turned out, if you’re concerned about quality I’d say that it definitely matches the price."
"This is hard to explain... because overall it does the expected job just fine, I can't truly complain. But 3 maybe 4 gripes stick out to me with this desk.1. Assembly instructions were fine up until the part where you're assembling the area where the drawer goes. There's a track it slides on, and that's fine, but the instructions say to place the adjacent bolts above the track with the nuts pointed in towards where the drawer would go, effectively blocking the drawer from the track. I took the liberty to reverse that so the drawer can properly slide along the track and you should too, it works great that way. However, I'm not a fan of a canvas drawer, but I digress.2. The light strip they include is nice, but the adhesive is not very reliable. I ended up buying some double-sided Gorilla tape to get a better stick and it hasn't fallen since.3. When screwing the hardware into the bottoms of the desktops, you have to be careful not to over tighten, which doesn't take much, because the bolt you're screwing in will begin to push through the surface and damage the work surface above. I had to back out and glue it back down, other spots I didn't go far enough to penetrate but there is a bulge, and I don't like it.4. Just a generally thin table. You get a lot for the money, so I'm not complaining, and what you don't get... you got what you paid for, so it's fine, though my previous desk was smaller and less expensive but much better quality and heft to it... perhaps it's just a sign of the times.Overall, it looks fantastic in my office, the lights can be controlled with either the remote or your phone via Bluetooth, it adds office workspace, it's comfortable to sit at, the reversible option when building is great, the extra storage above is a Godsend for me, still good quality for the money, if you need something heavier, spend more money. Oh, and the on-desk outlets are great for my mother when she comes over to do work, she doesn't have to reach down below to plug in her stuff."
"This desk is very easy to put together, and is very sturdy! Both the built in drawer and side compartment is very handy and useful. Also the extra storage beneath the desk is amazing! I ended up putting a mini fridge on the bottom shelf to replace the space. My favorite part about the desk is the power strip. It is super helpful and has many slots for different cords/chargers. Next, the 3 compartments above the desk are a nice touch, and gives you extra storage. In my opinion, it makes the desk look really good, and ties everything together. The only downside to this desk is the LED strip, due to the poor adhesive. After I completely assembled the desk, it didn’t take more than a few hours for the adhesive to start falling down, even with the screw on attachments to hold it up. Overall this is an amazing purchase, I would recommend."
"Purchased as a gift, so I guess I'll (Mom) do the review because they just paid for it. It was bought for the ""Mom"" cave, sewing room. Put it together by myself in about 3 hours of daytime TV ( Maury to the People's Court) with very few issues. I do agree with the other reviews.....drill! If you're good with puzzles, the directions will be a piece if cake. Some pieces weren't marked but you can figure it out through process of elimination and, if ya really have to, singing ""One of these things is not like the other"" seems to help. Keep an eye on the direction of your posts so you don't have to disassemble anything (ask me how I know that!). It does seem sturdy, holds all 3 sewing machines with tons of space, has purdy lights and looks much nicer than what I had."
"Looks relatively nice for the price. The materials are lightweight as a consequence of being a budget desk, but it's assembled and designed in a way that makes it sturdy, regardless. I would 100% buy this again, and for the price, I have no gripes, however, if I were to nitpick:Hooks to hang headphones would have been nice.The drawer is basically just cardboard and fabric. A drawer made of manufactured wood would have been nice.The LED strip has useless adhesive. I used Gorilla Glue branded sticky putty, which is a great solution.The adjustable feet can only raise the desk about 1/2inch. Another 1/2 inch would have been ideal. My office chair can just barely slide in with some rubbing of the arms.The assembly took about 4 hours, and I spent about 30 more minutes later making some adjustments.Overall I am very happy with my purchase, and for the price, it cannot be beaten."
"I have nothing but good things to say about this desk. From home sturdy it is to the space and how it still manages to pack a punch in my work environment while still fitting nicely tucked into a corner without giving me stuffy oversized vibes.  Relatively easy to put together however be mindful. The instructions may have took a little confused if you are setting it up the opposite to the original direction . The long draw is great for keeping things close and handy and the shelving as you can see comes in clutch."
"Very sturdy & very spacious. You guys kudos to you. It was so easy to put together. Thank you. Good product."
"Sturdy desk, excellent storage, cloth drawers so there wasnt the extra slide tracks to install. Perfect for my kids, their papers, pencils, fidget toys, double screens, keyboards, and gaming accessories.Would not recommend for laptops, no space to work."
"Overall I like the desk, especially with the multiple drawers that provide a lot of storage space. So many modern desks have nothing to offer storage wise! The four stacked ones are fabric, so it's not exactly a luxury one, but when closed they are fully covered so they look pretty good and you can't see the inside.The desk is pretty sturdy and looks good overall. Assembly is kind of a pain, it's not terrible but be prepared for several hours. Aside from assembly, five stars—especially considering the price."
"This was easy to put together. Very sturdy. A place for everything!  Just wondering if the power strip is a power surge strip. If not it would be an excellent addition."
"This desk has a lot of storage. Love the spot for the printer gives a ton of counter space. Great piece for the money. easy to put together."
"This is a compact desk yet big enough to accommodate three monitors, love the drawers and enough space for my printer. Very satisfied."
"Desk is a little more shallow than I expected and it was way more difficult to put together then it needed to be. Go slow and pay attention to the directions so you don't make any extra holes.It's sturdy enough and looks pretty good. I fastened two 32"" monitors to the top part of the desk and was able to place my PC on the side portion that is a little lower. I'll probably fasten the straps holding the monitors to the walls soon to give my a little extra security but overall it holding the weight of both and the PC fine.I was missing a few screws and contacted the seller. They shipped out a whole new pack of hardware. Everything works like it should. I'd only change the design to be a little bit deeper on the desk portion, but that my preference."
"Functionality isn’t quite there with this one. I wish they would have made this desk so you could use either a desktop OR laptop, so it’s uncomfortably cramped even with an iPad. I’d say that is the most irritating design flaw on this desk. The pictures are intentionally deceptive and look like you have WAY more room than you actually have. Not terribly heavy for a desk, but cumbersome to move because it is a tad flimsy, especially where the printer part “connects” to the desk.So anyway we have to take the top part for the monitors off which really sucks because I wanted to use the light strip underneath. The fabric drawers aren’t even IKEA quality. I’d say this is a good desk for a 12 year old boy who leaves Mountain Dew cans all over his bedroom floor and doesn’t appreciate nice things. If you’re an adult that wants a desk that doesn’t look like a Walmart reject, I’d spend the extra $100 on something a little better quality. Not a great value for your money."
"It took me months of reading and watching videos to finally decide to buy this brand of food processor. I have not been disappointed one bit! I was really thinking I should save and get a Breville. But I made the plunge that fit my budget much better. I have made pizza dough that turned out wonderful and so fast. I make cauliflower rice all the time. It is so fast and easy. It's definitely better to try to have your floweretts all cut about the same size. I make butter every week which is delicious and fun and I make home made peanut butter that my husband loves. I also have used it now several times for pie dough and empanada dough. It is super fast and easy and has turned out perfectly every time. It is very sturdy and doesn't move at all on the counter while I make my dough. It also grates cheese evenly and with very little waste.. Clean up is pretty easy too. I wash it right after I use it, in hot soapy water and rinse well. The only complaint I have is that there are a couple of places that you can't get in with a towel to dry. But I have found if I just leave it out on a towel for a few hours exposed to the air, those dry completely as well. Also,  I have found that if I dry it with a tea towel it comes out shiny and new looking. I don't use it for chopping garlic, but I tried it once and it worked. It's just easier to do that by hand with little clean up afterward. I wanted to cover these points for you to hopefully make your decision faster than mine.  It works just great and is much more budget friendly. I am very happy with my purchase."
"This is a very sturdy, very powerful and very quiet food processor. I think it’s the third food processor I’ve owned.  I am enjoying the larger bowl size for sure.So far I have used it to make pico de gallo and shredded cabbage for coleslaw and cut onions for hotdogs.  It did a great job for all of it. I used the chopping blade for the pico de Gallo and the onions. And I used the shredding disk attachment for the cabbage for the slaw.At first, I couldn’t get it to turn on, ☺️  but, that’s because I had the feeder tube too full for the metal spine on the back of the pusher to completely engage the safety feature.The biggest drawback I see is the way the safety feature on the lid is designed.  The safety mechanism is sort of open but at the same time closed if that makes any sense. It’s open enough for stuff to get in there and closed enough for you to have a hard time getting food particles out.  You may want to just check and be sure that there’s no food particles On the metal safety spine on the food pusher that you’ll push down into the safety channel on the lid.  Otherwise, you will play the game of rinsing and turning it upside down and swishing it/ flipping while holding the white thingy open until you can get the food particle to come out of it.  There may be a trick to this I haven’t figured out yet.  So far, I really like this processor, And, the prices for extra attachments on the Cuisinart website are very, very competitive with free shipping."
"""Oh, I don't need a food processor. I love to chop things by hand! And really, my cheap, tiny blender does just about any job a food processor could do. It's not worth the money!"" This has been my mantra for years.Oh, what a fool I was. What a fool!A food processor is such a magical device. You can do things with it that are impossible to do without it!Have you heard of cashew cream sauce? It's fabulous. You soak about two cups of cashews in water for 2 hours, drain and rinse them well, and then toss them in your food processor with a clove or two of peeled garlic, about 2/3 cup of water, and about a teaspoon or so of salt, to taste. Press the power on, and in seconds, you have smooth-bodied, flavourful dip that is extremely versatile. From there, it's all up to your imagination! Add some nutritional yeast to make it taste nice and cheesy, with just a pinch of paprika to bring out those cheesy notes, and serve it with tortilla chips. Or how about a bit of curry powder and some basil to serve with pita chips as a sweet, curry-style dip? Or perhaps you'll use some herbs and pour it over pasta, for a new twist on ""lazy pasta night""?Maybe you're no fan of that idea. Well then, how about making pesto right in your own home? Those tiny bottles in the grocery are never as good as the stuff as you can get in a nice restaurant, and they can be damned pricey for such mediocre flavour. Make it yourself, and be amazed!Or what about hummus? You can use a method by Kenji Lopez-Alt over at SeriousEats to make tahini sauce with garlic and lemon that makes for a FANTASTIC base for the best hummus of your life (made with, I suggest, the best on the market, and available also here on Amazon: Soom Foods Pure Ground Sesame Tahini 11oz (2 Pack))! Sabra has got NOTHING on homemade hummus.There's also the sheer joy of buying nuts in bulk, knowing that you're saving quite a bit of money tossing them into your food processor to get chopped rather than buying them pre-chopped. Or you can quickly chop toppings for a salad. There's a lot of chopping this thing can handle that you might not care to handle yourself!Or, how about this: the best homemade ice cream you've ever had? It's simple; make your custard-style base (I recommend Jeni Britton Bauer's method, Google it or pick up her book here: Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home), freeze it overnight in a big gallon freezer bag laid out flat, and the next day, break it into pieces to throw into your food processor. Then you can whip it to a gorgeous creamy state, add in some flavourings, pour into an ice cream container, and freeze; voila! The best homemade ice cream you've EVER had - guaranteed better than storebought, that's for sure, and a lot healthier, since you're in total control of what goes in it. :)And I'm sure before I even began to write this review, you had your own ideas. Nut butters? Certainly! How about dough? It can do it! Grating cheese? Well, I prefer an old-fashioned box grater, but if you're tired of washing that ol' beast, absolutely, go for one of these! There's just so many wonderful things you can do with this gorgeous machine; and it's outrageously simple to handle. I've seen a great many food processors in family homes; they're awkward, they're cumbersome, and they're very noisy. This isn't whisper-silent, but I can safely use it all hours of the night without losing a finger or waking my sleeping household.Now, I must confess I've had precisely one point of frustration with it since I bought it: I opened it up, threw in an ingredient, put the top back on, hit the ""ON"" button, and.. nothing. I was dumbfounded. Why isn't this brand new machine working?Turns out, it was a safety feature! I hadn't secured the top, so it didn't come on. And thank goodness! I would've had a big mess on my hands. Knowing that it will simply not turn on if I don't have the top fastened on correctly is a comfort to me; I can get to work and not worry about double-checking that I've put everything back in place just so, and I can trust little ones to put things into it without worrying that they'll get over-excited to turn it on and send ingredients flying around my kitchen! And it's so simple to put together and take apart once you take a few minutes to handle it first-hand.This is a wonderful machine to aid the home cook, and I believe if you've made it this far in my review, you know I'm right. You deserve this. It'll take a special position in your kitchen, just like a KitchenAid; in fact, a KitchenAid and this food processor have a constant presence on my countertop. If you love to cook, and you love to explore new techniques and recipes, then I beg of you; do yourself a big favour and get this today!"
"This is great for making pizza dough to pureeing soups - mine quit after 35 years - this is the same!"
"No blister switches to crack and fail,  all the power you need and consistent slicing.  America Test Kitchen top pick,  I can see why.  I liked our prior Cuisinart unit but thus unit is smaller footprint and all the performance."
"The product is probably great, but I haven't had the chance to try it because it is not adapted for the EU market.  I couldn't plug it in, so unfortunately I had to return it"
"Highly recommended! Even though ( or because ) this is an older model, at 600 W, it’s twice as powerful as any of the newer 7 cup  models and Very Quiet. It’s the smaller sized version used in real professional kitchens. Food is beautifully processed with just a light tap on the pedal... giving a pulsed or continuous current and there is no delay in the controls. Easy to use and clean"
"The Ninja NF705BRN Professional XL Food Processor is an absolute game-changer in my kitchen! The 1200 peak-watt motor is incredibly powerful, making quick work of anything I throw at it‚Äîfrom chopping veggies to making dough. It handles tough ingredients effortlessly, saving me so much time and effort compared to my previous processor.The quality of this machine is top-notch. The parts feel sturdy and well-made, and the entire unit has a solid, professional-grade build. The blades are incredibly sharp and durable, slicing through everything with ease. I also love the large capacity, which is perfect for preparing meals for my family or batch cooking.The included storage box is a nice touch, keeping all the accessories organized and easily accessible. The intuitive controls and multiple settings make it versatile for various tasks, and cleanup is a breeze with the dishwasher-safe parts.Overall, the Ninja NF705BRN exceeds expectations in both power and quality. If you're looking for a reliable, high-performance food processor, this one is definitely worth the investment. Highly recommended!"
"I absolutely love my Ninja BN601 Professional Plus Food Processor! From the moment I started using it, I knew it was going to be a game changer in my kitchen.

The versatility makes it perfect for various recipes, and I no longer need multiple gadgets for different tasks.The 9-cup bowl is ideal for preparing meals for my family in one go without needing to process in batches. It‚Äôs the perfect size for making doughs or large salads, but not so big that it takes up too much space.The processor comes with three sharp and durable blades that handle everything from fine chopping to coarse slicing. The dough blade is especially impressive‚Äîit makes kneading bread or pizza dough effortless.I appreciate the convenience of the food chute and pusher for adding ingredients without stopping the processor. It keeps things moving smoothly and makes processing safer and faster.Not only is this machine solidly built, but it also looks great on my countertop with its sleek silver finish. It's a perfect blend of style and performance.The 1000 watts of power is more than enough for any task, from the softest fruits to tougher vegetables. I‚Äôve never experienced any issues with performance. This machine doesn‚Äôt overheat, stall, or struggle. I also find it very easy to use with intuitive controls and straightforward assembly.

"The media could not be loaded.
                



This food processor is great. It has shredded zucchini and blocks of cheese with ease. It was a bit more expensive but we decided to upgrade. I like how l it has multiple options and tools. It is high powered. It is large and bulky so we don‚Äôt store it in kitchen. It is loud but efficient, so it‚Äôs only loud for a short time."
"I have a ninja 3 cup chopper/mini food processor that I‚Äôve used for YEARS and it still works perfectly. But I needed something larger. I was nervous because I bought the ninja smoothie bullet type blender a few years back, and while it works well it is painfully loud. This one is NOT, it‚Äôs like a whisper it‚Äôs so quiet. It cuts evenly no matter how much I put in, super clear directions. Love that I can pop it in the dishwasher. I have the base on the counter next to my air fryer tucked under a little hideaway shelf. Easy to pull out, use and push back. The suction cups on the base to keep it sturdy or surprisingly powerful! Very nice touch. So many brands seem to have lost their credibility and have lost my trust. But, Ninja has not, I completely trust their products to be quality, sturdy, easy to use and to last for years and years no matter if it‚Äôs a small or large model."
"This food chopper is amazing! I have had it for almost a year now and it works and looks as it did the first time I used it. It has great power. I have never had any issues chopping up whatever I am trying to. The canister is large and does not leak. It has little suction cups on the bottom that help stabilize it. You actually have to pull a little to get it off the counter. Great value for the amount I spent!"
"When I received the box, I just knew it was way more than what I needed. My fault !A 9 cup food processor is way too much for myself and wife. The price is descent with a superior strength motor. It‚Äôs just too big for small jobs or cooking for 2 or 3. If your family is 4 or more or cook a great deal very often, get it."
"This is my first food processor and I bought it to make nut and seed butters. It has annihilated almonds, so I am pleased with it. I probably need to add oil to make a liquid butter.It‚Äôs a little loud, but not unbearable. It‚Äôs easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. It‚Äôs good for storing the finished product too.It works well on almonds and sprouted pumpkin seeds. I think it‚Äôll work well on walnuts too."
"This food processor saves so much time with slicing and chopping.  It has a strong motor and the size is perfect for my family.  I have been using the food processor for a month now and can't find one thing I don't like about it.  It's easy to use; easy to clean, and saves a lot of my time since I no longer have to chop, dice or slice ingredients.  It can be used for kneading dough, another time saver.  In short, I love this product!"
"Okay, I bought this model because the lower one didn‚Äôt have a function puree function. I saw others say the puree function didn‚Äôt work well but it does. Shredding cheese and carrots works well. It handles dough mixing very well. Others saying the grate/chop blade leaves pieces on top, it does but they‚Äôre negligible (couple little pieces). My only complaint is that the feed tube could be a little larger but no big deal. This thing is awesome and at a very reasonable price."
"excellent product , very powerful motor ,thick plastics"
"It‚Äôs terrible that this product is being sold to the UAE market. Blew my fuses using it."
"Powerful machine. Small size, easy to assemble, easy to store. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Good value. Helps to reduce cooking time."
"nice small chopper, easy to operate, easy to clean, takes up little counter space great price"
"Streamlined design, Easy to assemble and use.Thorough at chopping and pureeing.Cleanup is easy  and quick.  Glad I bought it."
"Note: This is an initial product review after one week of limited and mild use only. I use the machine no more than 45 seconds overall during each use and use it 5 to 7 times a week. I use this product only to blend minced/chunck wet cat food into a patte consistency. This initial review was posted on 28 April 2024. I will follow up with a long-term review, if anything changes.PERFORMANCEPositives:- relatively quiet compared to my old Protor Silex mini food processor- safety feature is intuitive making it faster to start blending compared to my old Proctor Silex- does a good job of mincing and blending chunks of meat.- hand clean up is very easy. I quick rinse the blending compartment, the blade and the top/cover with hot sink water, spray everything with soap and then fill with hot sink water to the top, close the cover/lid & let it sit for a little while in the sink. When I have the time again, I empty the soapy water, rinse everything out and set aside to dry.Negatives- The gap between the low and the high blade is big enough so that anything under 4 oz will not mince or blend evenly. Even after stopping and pushing the food down, 3 different time in-between the blending, chunks of meat still remained unblended. The 5.5 oz can wet cat food blends perfectly in about 20 or so seconds.BUILD QUALITY- After using it in a limited and mild capacity for only a week, the initial impression is that the motor is strong, but overall the unit feels light, plasticky and on the cheaper side. The proctor silex unit felt a sturdier & better built than this. I hope though that this unit lasts longer than my proctor silex unit, which lasted only 8 months of mild use before it died. 30-45 second use, 1 time a day, 5 to 7 days a week."
"I bought this blender a while back and just now getting around to using it recently and I've gotta tell ya, this little blender is very powerful, quick and very easy to clean. Not bulky and a million parts to it. Very simple and I love it!! I almost want to purchase another one as a backup should something ever happen to the one I have now. Highly Recommend this product! You won't be disappointed"
"#####Original Review on August 28, 2024#####Simply WE LOVE IT!!!It works pretty good for small quantities and cleans up super easy!!! Be it chopping/dicing the vegetables into tiny bits or processing the food to a smooth consistency it can do it all either by pulsating or blending it. The blade is thin and super sharp too.We have been using it for several things since we got it a month or so ago and have made several dishes such as Guacamole, Sauces, diced veggies(onions, peppers, carrots), Indian chutneys with nuts and veggies aka Roti Pachadi etc.It's a simple setup of base motor, blade and a lid with a pulsating ON/OFF button; that's it. To clean it I just use a silicon spatula to get all the contents out, then you just need to rinse the blade and the container under tap, apply some warm soapy water and rinse it again....it's that simple. The container, blade and the lid are not dish washer safe as they are pretty light weight.Overall, a great value simple vegetable chopper and processor that works like a champ.########Update October 8th, 2024 ############This has become our go to blender/chopper for all our chopping needs unless we need it a certain way especially for onions, peppers, garlic, cilantro, mint etc. We even threw some chunks of chicken breast, salt, jalapenos, few garlic cloves, onions, cilantro, cumin and coriander powder and gave it a spin for few seconds and this beast was able to mince everything together perfectly without any problem to make some yummy chicken patties...way to go Hamilton Beach!!!"
"This is just what I needed: a simple chopper/processor that is easy to use and clean and takes up very little space."
"Just the right size, and powerful enough to do anything I've asked it to do. But the best part is no sliding track to fit everything together. On the bottom, one side of the circle is flat so it's like a notch but a very big one that is so easy to put on the base. Then the cover just sits on top waiting for you to press it. It's hard to describe how easy it fits together and operates. It's that easy. Needless to say, I love it"
"This little machine has a very powerful motor. It doesn’t hold very much but is great for one or two people to chop one or two onions, celery, etc. the only difficulty I have is courser chopping. The motor is so powerful that you literally have to put it on for a second or two before everything is very small. It is extremely useful and time saving. I can normally chop an onion or celery very quickly, but I have a condition that makes my hands shake and are not as reliable as before my illness. I bought this chopper primarily to save my hands from a cut if I slip with the knife, which is entirely possible. A real timesaver in the kitchen, particularly if you cook from scratch all the time as I do. It also cleans very easily. Usually I can just rinse it out and it’s fine. There is no annoying interlock. You just put on the plastic top and push super easy. I highly recommend."
"Good  product and proactive seller"
"Great product, works well, easy to use and easy to clean"
"good item  easy to use, and easy to clean.. have used it many times and will continue to do so.. im happy with this purchase"
"Really nice product. Easy to use, ( my second Hamilton), just watch out for the slicer blade. I stuck it into a finger while washing. OUCH and lots of blood, but,,,, DOES IT SLICE"
"I LOVE this processor! Excellent build quality. This unit is comparable to a high end robot coupe. The safety lock feature is excellent. Would highly recommend! The blades are extremely durable they are not thin cheap blades. The only feature I have not used is the dough blade. I will review again at a later time, have only had it for two weeks. So far so good!!you"
"It isn‚Äôt the easiest to clean (the lip on the cover is difficult), it isn‚Äôt as powerful as expected either but for the price we are content. It‚Äôs fairly thin plastic which makes it a bit scary to use."
"I love this food processor. I really needed something to help me cut/slice because of an accident that left me unable to do certain tasks. This has helped tremendously and it‚Äôs dishwasher safe."
"UPDATE Nov 2024: Its time for Thanksgiving prep, which i use a food processor to cut up the larger amounts of stuff there is, and guess what? I realized i never received the missing slicer shredder wheel I reported within a day of receiving this food processor. I have this life to live, see, so i forgot about it.  So not only did they give me a line about the fact that this was covered by my warranty so they would magnanimously cover for their quality error, but they never sent the replacement. Now I am angrily cutting up a mound of celery.  I went on their website and purchased the wheel for $8.99 + $11.95 for shipping so that i at least have the blasted wheel for future use. Let the record show that i will never ever do business with Hamilton Beach again. There are so many other options that no one has to put up with lousy customer service. OCT2024:I ordered this food processor because I liked the snap on pieces of the plastic cup parts, the size of the cup and that it came with all the pieces I needed for food processing. When it arrived in a box that looked like it had never been opened, the shredder/slicer wheel was missing. I wrote Hamilton Beach via the contact the seller Amazon feature, and the person responding dared to mention that this was definitely under warranty and they were going to wave the $6 fee to ship it that normally applies! Why did they even mention this when it was their packaging quality issue? It should have been ""we're sorry, it'll be there right away!"". Instead, it's been 14 days since I received this product and I still don't have the shredder wheel we need to process the horse radish in our garden.  I might change this to 2 or 3 stars once I finally get the part because the rest of the food processor is nice and works fine. But right now I'm too frustrated. We'll see how long it takes to finally get the wheel."
"It's size is big enough for my cooking, very easy to use. Will recommend to buy this product!"
"I hate preping veggies especially  onions . This makes it so much easier. Sticks to the counter and won't start if all pieces are jot together correctly.  Makes slicing for my soups so much faster and more uniform veggies"
"This item is great value. Easy to use and clean. Everything about this food processor works for me. I am happy with this purchase."
"My wife likes it so much. It is easy to use and clean up. It chops vegetables in a few seconds which saves me a lot of time and trouble."
"Excellent product. So easy to use and clean up is a breeze.  I absolutely love all the Hamilton beach products I own.The service I received ; from finding the item I wanted, ordering and getting my food processor in such a timely manner, was phenomenal.  Thank you very much for everything."
"Let me tell you about this amazing food processor I recently got my hands on.

Plus, the consistency and precision of the cuts are always on point, resulting in perfectly uniform ingredients for my recipes.Durability is another major plus with this Cuisinart food processor.

The parts are removable and dishwasher-safe, so you can spend more time enjoying your meal and less time scrubbing in the sink.

"It goes together easily. The day I purchased it the price was excellent!!"
"Bought it with coupon, very good price. However, it arrived missing in a damaged box and mixing a dough blade. Doesn’t appear to be a used product, so not sure what happened. Returning"
"Love this. I bought for the shredding option mainly. Makes shredding vegetables a breeze. Seems to be a very strong motor. Base is heavy, won’t shift while working with it. All plastic containers/parts feel strong and durable. Easy to clean and store. I shopped around quite a bit before choosing Cuisinart. Very happy with this food processor."
"Cuisinart 9-cup is the perfect mid-size food processor for smaller kitchens that lean towards medium sized recipes. This model (DLC-2009) has been around for many years and is significantly more powerful than 2024 Cuisinart models with similar capacity. It’s relatively quiet, too."
"I purchased a second Cuisinart to accommodate the larger batches of dog food I prepare. Once one learns the ease of use, food preparation is so quick and easy. The weight of the base is manageable but substantial. The containers in which food goes is easy to maneuver and wash. It fits in the top part of a dishwasher. It looks and feels like a quality piece of kitchen equipment. The  performance is excellent. Noise is controlled  by a button which allows the user to pulse the processor thereby giving the user noise control. Performance is consistently predictable. BTW  I believe this was a refurbished product. Thanks Amazon for the savings."
"Fabulous buy for the price. I am so happy with this purchase. The interior is huge. The bowl in the photo is a 3.5c size. Just to give you a baseline of the size. It‚Äôs so much larger than my Kenmore 1000wt that died after only 3.5 years. Not happy with that at all. But I purchased a used-like new that only had a serious bash on one corner that came no where near the unit itself. It‚Äôs in perfect shape and looks great on my shelf unit. I also saved about $100.00 with the sale price and the used price for sure. Very happy camper here. And if I ever get around to reading the manual again it has mute. But the sound is really mild and it goes off after 4 little beeps. Wonderful!!! The Kenmore kept beeping at me until I went and opened the door. An-noy-ing‚ÄºÔ∏èüòÇ  I really like this microwave. It‚Äôs plenty powerful as well. Try it out, you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"The size is exactly I want. Two people in the condo have the idea microwave. I trust the brand: reliable and no trouble at all. My mom had a Japanese clock. Its instruction said 10 year guarantee. Exactly on the 10th anniversary, it stopped. Nobody could fix it. My mom loved it and tried to keep it longer in vain."
"After 3+ months of multiple daily use: zero negatives.Functions to love:1. Keypad silent option.2. Decent capacity for all my needs.3. I cook a mondo-size sweet potato every day to add to my dog's food (and mine) ‚Äî the average cook time is 17+- minutes ‚Äî long I know vs an air fryer (just don't have the counter space) ‚Äî I've had no heat-related malfunctions.Great microwave for small apartments and kitchens."
"I bought the microwave in February 2024 and it worked perfectly for 8 months. Then randomly it stopped heating. The light came on, the turntable turned, and it beeped -- the food would just not warm up. I get it though, there are defective products every now and then.The GOOD news is that Toshiba was very good with their customer service. I talked to a customer service person online, sent a few pictures of the model/serial number, and they issued a full refund through the warranty within a few hours."
"I had the big brother of this Toshiba, the 1.2 cu ft. It was great but it was MASSIVE and took a lot of space.  I got rid of it and got me a super compact Chefman  .7 cu ft. Used that microwave for a few months but then it developed a really unpleasant pee odor inside the microwave. Really weird. So i got rid of it and i did a lot of research and decided to get this higher wattage and bigger .9 cu ft size Toshiba.  I am super happy because this Toshiba is still very compact and it looks great too with a bit more power which gets really good reviews in the cooking performance department compared to other more expensive models. So far im super happy üëå"
"[UPDATE at end]  I've owned many microwaves, was the first person I know to buy one, in 1974.  People use to come over to try it, a modern marvel.  And wonder of wonders, this is the only other microwave since that original one (a Gaffers and Sattler) that explains in the manual how to make creative use of aluminum foil in the microwave!  I didn't know you could still do that.  The purchase was worth it for that knowledge alone (I was an old hand at using foil- on the wings of chickens, with rolls, bread, things that cook too quickly compared to other parts of the meal).  No scrimping on the packaging- it arrived in a heavy-weight box within a box and encased in styrofoam, so no chance of dents or damage, yet easy to unpack.Aesthetically I LOVE this.  I fancy it has a chunky retro mid-century look to it, like what a food replicator looked like on the original Enterprise.  I don't have the best eyesight and the buttons are big and clearly labeled- can see them without my glasses.  Ditto with the digital display, bright green; the light inside is bright too.  The handle is thick and solid in your hand, pleases me every time I use it (haven't had a microwave in years with an actual handle, SO much better, feels decisive, purposeful, kinesthetically pleasing).  The operation is intuitive (for the most part) and basic, well-thought-out, satisfying.  I'm coming from a fancy Panasonic unit with inverter technology that I was in love with, but as is apparently common with Panasonic microwaves it died after a few months.  It's a trade-off- I much prefer the look and operation of this (for example, the Panasonic had no number pad) but it takes slightly longer to cook, but that's okay.Being able to turn the sound off is a blessing.  I'm living in my vintage travel trailer at the moment and have two little finches that don't need to be awakened at all hours (they answer the beeps with chirps).  Relatedly the door makes a rather loud but not unpleasant thunk when closed normally, but it can also be closed gently, more quietly when desired- after a week it's already second nature to me.  The microwave when running is quieter than most.  Also wanted to say I nearly sent this back because the power level button didn't work.  What an idiot- when all else fails read the manual.  You change the power level AFTER you enter the cooking time.So far I love this thing, and like the many other Toshiba products I've owned over the years, hope it lasts a good long time.  (After my experience with the short-lived Panasonic I got the three-year warranty- a bargain at $6.)  But if it dies or malfunctions I'll update this review.  Thank-you Toshiba!UPDATE:  I had a senior moment and forgot to put the frozen lasagna in the microwave.  I manually set it for seven minutes and pressed start.  I was doing other things in the kitchen and about five minutes in the microwave went dead.  No display, no power, nothing.  It was HOT inside.  Oh great, I blew a fuse or WORSE, I thought.  I couldn't find the owner's manual.  I tried unplugging it, plugging it back in, nothing.  No re-set button on the back.  SO disgusted with myself.  Thought I was going to have to have it serviced or replaced.  About 15 minutes later it came back to life, after it cooled off, good as new.  Thank-you Toshiba!!"
"I've a small apartment with limited counter space. This microwave fits nicely, works well and is quiet."
"I love this microwave.  The control panel is easy.  Size of the oven is perfect.  Price was super.  Highly recommend."
"I bought a different Microwave, My Dream Retro Red at a fair price but it was not to be, came damaged and it was the last one.Amazon customer Service blew me away, They had the issue resolved in hours, so I ordered from a Trusted name. Cost more , but it arrived 2 Days early , Loved that. Apparently I hadn't noticed my old micro wave was suffering ...I put a container of corn in one day in front of my Son at 3mins 33secs ..My son was horrified and I didn't understand why until This new one came . Same container of corn done in 1 minute...Smiles*I'm Happy , Can you tell ? ...lolEdit: Hate ruining my own happiness , but I ordered the 1.2 size and that's what I paid for. Got  the .9  and all the prices went up , when you check ...shakes head..Thought at least you could Trust A  Name like Toshiba , but seems even they must be watched like a hawk ..I am not returning  but I am feeling slighted ..The price difference at the time of purchase was very small ...So I'll eat this but watch out folks, pay attention."
"Unobtrusive. Small footprint.  Love that we can shut off the the sound and  the  stand by display (when you press the button to set the time, the display will come on again).  It was the right price.  Does it's job well. Didn't feel we would get our money's worth  getting a more expensive and flashy microwave.  Will buy again or recommend to a friend."

"After many years of service, my GE SpaceMaker II microwave needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, the line has been discontinued by GE. They offer one model that's close to the dimensions, but the size would not work well for the space I have (built-in shelf). While there are lots of compact microwaves, the issue is the depth -- most are too deep to fit on a wall shelf.This has the proper depth for sitting on a shelf without issue provided that you use a flat pig-tail adapter so that the plug doesn't jut out and prevent the microwave from sitting close to the wall. The width is less than the nearly 24 inches of the SpaceMaker, but I filled the empty shelf space with a storage cannister that I found that matches the microwave.The microwave itself is a basic model that has few bells and whistles. I only use the microwave to reheat leftovers, and this does a fine job of that. Heating is even, and the 700W, while low powered compared with larger microwaves, gets the job done just fine. The controls are easy to use and are very similar to the SpaceMaker controls, which was a plus for me. The fit and finish are much better than other compact microwaves I looked at. It will fit a full-size dinner plate without issue.It's not a perfect replacement for the SpaceMaker, but it's a workable one. It provides good functionality as a basic compact microwave, looks much nicer than you would expect for the price point, and is easy to use. A very good value for the price, especially if you can catch it on a price dip. Five stars."
"The microwave ion our vacation/rental house died. We selected the GE unit, even though it cost a bit more than some competitors for several reasons. First, a longer warranty than most competitors, especially ""brand X"" products. Second, we have GE ""Profile"" appliances in our main home and they have been reliable. Third, it is stylish, with obviously better fit and finish than competitors. After having it awhile now, we have found it simple to use and very efficient."
"Needed small microwave to fit on pantry shelf. This one works well -just have to get used to lower power than our built in one had."
"Size and look right for tiny house kitchen"
"Had to purchase a number of appliances back in 2021 when I moved into my first home ; various brands include Samsung, LG, Cuisinart, Frigidaire and GE.I always considered GE to be a pretty reputable brand. After a condenser in one of their $400 portable air conditioner units completely crapped out, I thought maybe it was just a poorly made unit and a one-off occurrence. However, after seeing the state of this microwave that I purchased in 2021 after a deep clean this week, I am beginning to think otherwise on GE! And now reading reviews with similar issues for the same microwave happening; the white paint chipping off and rust on the ceiling and corners. Pretty sure this is just overall poor manufacturing practices.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a compact microwave. We had to replace this unit immediately as we don't want rust/paint in our food and picked out one from a different brand. This one will not last and not taking chances again on any GE appliances!"
"I didn‚Äôt realize this was such a small size microwave.  It is nice and works. But it‚Äôs very small and only 700 watts. This is probably best for a dorm or small apartment. My mistake in ordering this.  I will have to get a full size for the kitchen at some point.Fast shipping and easy set up were positives."
"This ia a small, compact microwave which is wonderful for a limited space.  It fits nicely on a shelf in my kitchen above the counter top.  I use it to warm a beverage,sandwich, or small dish.  This unit is well constructed and attractive."
"Nice and compact... taking up very little counter space. - Cooks and heats up food quickly & evenly.Would like it even more... if it had a 24-hour clock display (my personal preference.__CONS:1- It produces a LOT of condensation (water). - Most microwaves do... but this one is excessive.So much so that I have to go over the entire interior of the microwave three or four times (after squeezing the water out of the sponge).. to clear up ALL the accumulated water.2- The BIGGER issue IS... the lining of the microwave is beginning to ""bubble"" & separate from the base of the microwave. - And, this is a brand new microwave (3-months old).SEE... the attached photos."
"Approx. 2 months ago (LESS THAN 1 YEAR AFTER PURCHASE) the microwave started to develop a gash on the interior back wall. It progressively got worse with more use. It then started to emit a grey smokey substance which smells like the grinding of metal. It has rendered this unit un unusable. I am deeply saddened as GE products which I have bought & used in the past were among the best quality. I have had to purchase a new one. This unit at a cost of $240, did not last 1 year. The supplier refuses to refund my money because the 30 day return policy has expired and the 1 year warranty has also expired. This is unacceptable, as this product is truly dangerous!!!"
"I‚Äôm absolutely loving the Amazon Echo Pop! This little device is a powerhouse in a compact, stylish design. The sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for its size, delivering great bass and crisp highs, perfect for filling a room with music or getting clear responses when asking questions. The voice recognition is spot-on, and Alexa responds quickly and accurately, whether I‚Äôm asking about the weather, setting reminders, or controlling my smart home devices.The design is sleek and modern, with vibrant color options that add a pop of personality to any space. It fits perfectly on a shelf, countertop, or desk without taking up too much space, and the sound projection is still impressive. The setup was a breeze, and I love the hands-free convenience it offers.For a budget-friendly, space-saving smart speaker, the Echo Pop is a fantastic choice. It delivers excellent value with great sound, smart features, and a stylish look. Highly recommend!"
"I like how small and easy this Echo Pop is to put out and set up. It will fit pretty much anywhere as it doesn't take up much space. And it was a breeze to get it going. First thing I did with it was use the Alexa app to play music from Pandora. It puts out really good, crisp sound for such a small device. Sure, it may not sound super amazing but considering its size I was impressed with the sound quality. Have not had any issues with it except that right after I first set it up, it lost its internet connection. But I just unplugged and replugged it in and that took care of it. I have been using it for a few weeks now and there have been no more issues since."
"Very decent smart speaker, small , cute but loud enough, most important hears me well and understand my accent ü§£I got it with smart bulb as bundle, now I can switch on off my light in room, can turn tv on off and heater as well, I combined this speaker with Tuya IR sensor to manipulate tv and heater by voice . The process of setting up is easy , I asked gpt chat about steps ü§£ works amazingly well. Highly recommend, most easiest experience with smart home I had in my life and I went through a lot ü§£"
"I recently picked up the new Amazon Echo Pop, and while it‚Äôs an impressive little smart speaker overall, there are a few things to consider before making your purchase. First, I love the sleek, compact design‚Äîit's modern and fits perfectly into any room, whether on a desk, kitchen counter, or nightstand. The vibrant color options also add a fun touch, so it can easily blend in or stand out depending on your style.The setup process was incredibly easy, and it integrates smoothly with my other Alexa devices. Voice recognition is spot-on, and I‚Äôm able to control music, smart home devices, and get the latest news or weather without any issues. The sound quality is clear and crisp for its size, making it great for casual listening and everyday tasks.While the Echo Pop delivers good sound for its compact size, it‚Äôs not very loud. This speaker is more suited for smaller spaces or personal use, where you don‚Äôt need booming sound but still want decent audio for podcasts, music, or voice commands.Overall, the Amazon Echo Pop is a solid option if you want a space-saving, stylish smart speaker with Alexa integration. Just keep in mind that the volume might not be ideal for louder, more dynamic audio needs. It‚Äôs perfect for casual listening, but if you're after powerful sound, you might want to explore a larger Echo model."
"The Amazon Echo has been an absolute game-changer in my home! Setting it up was incredibly easy, and it integrated seamlessly with my other smart devices. The sound quality is impressive, especially for such a compact device‚Äîit‚Äôs clear, rich, and fills the room beautifully.I use Alexa for everything: setting reminders, controlling my smart lights, playing music, and even managing my shopping list. The voice recognition is spot-on, even when there‚Äôs background noise. I also love how it continuously gets smarter with regular updates and new features.Overall, the Echo is a versatile, reliable, and fun addition to any home. Whether you‚Äôre a tech enthusiast or just looking for a little extra convenience, I highly recommend it!"
"It was super easy to pair and use with my phone and also connects easily with all other Alexa items I have around the house. It's very knowledgeable and can answer questions in no time. Has a good speaker system aswell so if you want to play music in your room or whereever you have it it's a good go. The voice recognition is instantly aswell but also has a button on it if you want to turn off the mic you can. Overall a really good product and a really good entry product to the Amazon Echo series."
"This is my third Echo device and second kind of. First two, Echo Pops, were purchased for my daughter. Actually, after I got one for her, she loved it so much that I decided to get another one for stereo and better sound overall. So she is happy! But the thing is after playing with Alexa while setting up my daughters Pops, I kind of fell in love with this device myself lol. So I bought a 4th generation Echo (thank you for Amazon Prime day and better price lol) and I’m very happy now. So as you can see on one of my pics the Echo is definitely larger than Echo pop, therefore takes a bit of more room which might be Cons for someone, it’s more than twice expensive and still has a white power cord lol. Those were Cons. And other ten thousand reasons to buy it will be Pros. Well the first main advantage over the Pop for me is a noticeable sound quality improvement (which is understandable since the Echo is a way larger therefore a speaker itself is definitely larger). No, I’m not trying to say Pop isn’t good. It’s a great speaker for its size and price, I’m just talking about my preferences now. So for its size and price Echo is an amazing speaker, sound quality is more than just decent, has pretty nice bass, especially on lower volumes, excellent quality built, has a tripod thread (or wall mount or any standard mount screw hole I believe) and has different color choices. Alexa does its job exactly the same way as on Pops (no surprise lol). I’ve got the one you see on my pics (something like blue I believe) just in case, because I’m still dreaming about its larger brother/sister (whatever lol) - Echo Studio. So “just in case” means our kitchen cabinets color surprisingly matches my new Echo so I’m thinking to move this useful companion to our kitchen in the future. I still feel I’m a beginner in Alexa universe so she can’t stop surprising me with my smart devices. With my new Echo I also ordered a smart bulb to see how it works together and of course I’m pleasantly surprised - I don’t have to lift my lazy bottom out of bed anymore, my bedroom nightstand light is voice operated now. Alexa turns it on or off, Alexa dims it to my desired preferences,  Alexa turns it on in the mornings thanks to my routine group setting. Love the feature how easy to listen to my favorite music around our apartment now - I just asked Alexa to play music everywhere and my playlist started to sound on all 3 Echo devices we have (had to create an “everywhere” group before by the way). Just Amazing! I’m not talking about thousands of other features Alexa offers like weather, news, history, songs etc… etc… etc… After my little experience with both Pop and Echo and all the features Alexa offers my point of view about Echo devices changes, and not to Alexa or AI side, they are not perfect yet, but definitely improving, and Alexa works equally on both devices, so here is a matter of future software updates. It changes towards the Echo devices now. I can clearly hear the sound difference, both, in my opinion, perfect for its size as I mentioned above, and especially its price range. Sorry for comparison, but my $200+ Bose speaker sound exactly the same as my new Echo (and Bose doesn’t have Alexa living inside lol (or who knows maybe there is something I’m not aware of yet, but Bose still can’t beat the price). So after my first Echo Pop purchase, I’m impressed again, now with even better sound quality. Even now, during my finger gymnastics writing this review I’m thinking again to buy a next Echo for our bedroom and then Echo Studio for our living room. Oh, then garage, laundry………etc. So pleasant to have that amazing feeling of satisfaction of spending money the right way lol. Hope someone will find my review helpful."
"This was my first smart speaker purchase.  Initially, I only wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to move between my office and garage.  I didn’t find anything with decent sound for under $100, so I started looking at smart speakers compatible with Amazon and Google.  Per the many reviews I read, both the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest have good sound, but the Echo has better sound than the Nest.  The Echo also has a 3.5mm jack while the Nest does not, so I chose the Echo.  I wanted that jack as a way to connect my Walkman and listen to my playlists instead of using Bluetooth and draining Walkman battery.My Echo arrived a few days ago and here is my review.  Other smart speaker brands like Sonos, Bose, and Sony were way too expensive for my application and many were not fully compatible with all of the Alexa and Google features.  That was a surprise.  Plus, they were still mono speakers like the Echo and Nest.Amazon immediately sent a link so I could start the setup process before receiving the Echo.  That also gave me time to download and take a good look at the Alexa app on my Android phone.  This initial setup process only took a few minutes.  When the Echo arrived, I read the documentation, then plugged it in and finished the setup process using the app.  There are a lot of possible settings, but many didn’t apply to me because I am not using any smart devices.  This process also was easy.I plugged my Walkman into the 3.5 mm jack and didn’t hear any audio.  Later, I figured out that the jack can be configured as an output to another speaker or as an input from devices like my Walkman and the default is as an output.  Problem solved.The buttons on top of the Echo are clearly marked and are raised, so they are easy to identify and operate.  The Echo has some weight to it that makes it stable when placed on my desk or workbench.  It is light enough to make it portable.  The Echo is not considered as a portable device because it must be plugged in, so I added a power supply ($15 on Amazon) in my garage and now I do consider it portable.  The ring at the bottom turns blue when Alexa is connected.  There is a button to turn the microphone off if desired.  The sound is pretty decent; not Hi-Fi but certainly good enough for my purposes and better than the portable Bluetooth speakers I initially looked at.  The Bluetooth connection between the Echo and my Walkman took less than a minute to create.  That’s great because my Walkman has had issues trying to connect to external speakers in the past.  The Echo also recognized a Bluetooth signal from other devices in my house, but I didn’t need to connect any of them.I had not planned to use the Echo as a smart device, but found it so easy and convenient that I am using it fairly often for weather forecasts, to find out what channel a game is on, for current news, and other things.  It’s fun and Alexa answers almost immediately.  Some reviewers complained that they have to repeat requests or speak loudly to get a response from their Echo.  I have not had any issues at all, even with Amazon Music playing and the volume up.The best thing is that Amazon was selling the Echo for half price when I purchased it.  I neglected to choose a color so my order defaulted to blue.  It’s a soft blue and I like it.  The only thing I don’t like, and other reviews have commented on this, is that regardless of the Echo color the power supply and cable are white.  They should be same color as the Echo.So far, I am thrilled with my purchase.  Easy to setup, easy to use, responsive, sounds good, portable, and looks good.  I can operate the Echo either directly through the speaker and buttons or through the Alexa app on my phone.  Both work well.  I started with my phone during setup, but now only use the speaker.Update:  Amazon replaced my Echo with a new one.  The hum problem is now resolved.  It is just as responsive and sounds just as good as the original echo that I returned had has no issues.  Now that I have spent some time with the Echo I am glad I chose it over the Google Nest."
"The Echo 4 is actually beyond my expectations. It is physically fairly heavy, the quality of manufacture and finish is good. There is a standard screw thread tripod socket on the bottom of the Echo 4 and the power cable is about 2 metres long. I have two Echo 4’s which I easily paired using the Alexa app on my iPhone into a stereo group with left and right channels. I was also able to choose several streaming programs, including Amazon Music (default) and Apple Music. You can also use TuneIn, Spotify and Deezer. The amount of bass is very impressive  and a bit heavy out of the box but you can adjust the bass, treble and midrange using the app or by asking Alexa. The communication ring light on the base of each unit is easily visible, it’s very ‘Gort’ in operation, especially in a darkened room. I had seen in some influencer reviews complaints about putting the ring on the bottom but it works well in this location. Alexa, hears my voice even over fairly loud music about 90% of the time and when the music is playing at low levels all of the time."
"Replaced my decade old alarm clock with this and couldn't be happier. She hears me from the hallway. She is like having a personal assistant, which is super helpful for me while recovering from a concussion I got a month ago. I can turn music on/off, volume up/down, set verbal reminders and alarms. With buying a smart plug I can turn my A/C on/off verbally or through the app. I can ask her questions, she's very responsive and hasn't gotten confused by my voice or wording yet. I dont know how I got through the last month without one. I think my Ma needs one for Christmas, dont know what youre missing til you have one."
"It kills me to only give 3 stars for this product because I love the entire Echo/Alexa series but this Echo 4 is just nothing special compared to the other ones and can never hear me when I call it. Sometimes I call it 7-9 times before giving up and asking Google Nest or another Echo device. The ring light on the bottom is a poor design choice as well. There's just nothing new or exciting (besides colour) about Generation 4. Yes she's a bit quicker but sometimes that's a negative because she closes out before you get a chance to say anything/finish your question. Too much hassle to send back but will be last Amazon smart device until they come up with something new/exciting.I can't even find any use or even mention of the zigbee hub. The one thing I love which is probably unimportant to most is the indoor temperature feature. Love knowing the temperature in my room by asking. This is extremely hard of hearing and never wakes up when I ask it to, yet wakes up when its dead quiet. Very strange experience this purchase. Hopefully Amazon can release a fix (OTA) for the hearing issue as its a major issue and walking to control the echo 4 defeats its purpose.Update- no firmware updates have fixed anything yet, I love my echoes but I wish I had of bought another one with a screen as I find those ones 1000 times more useful. A Red ball is cool looking but that’s about it. Having a screen has spoiled me."
"I love the design, the size and feel. The sound is adequate for my night music needs.The voice recognition is poor, making me repeat Alexa often. Whisper mode works well, so I don’t understand why it does not wake when I say Alexa normal voice often.It lost my Sengle smart light just after a month of working perfectly...also a mystery why. Now it will not recognize the light at all. I will have to talk to the nice amazon techies soon."
"There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!UPDATE:  After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!ADDENDUM:After two years, these still shine as brightly as ever. But the thing that must be emphasized is that this system of two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub is designed to take full advantage of Amazon Music’s HD streaming service, since these can work together only with streamed audio. Using that enables you to get at least CD quality audio recorded in lossless FLAC files (what Amazon calls HD, 16-bit/44.1kHz) for everything in the catalog, and Ultra HD (up to 24-bit/192kHz) available on an ever-growing list of recordings. In addition, it is also capable of playing Amazon’s (admittedly still in limited quantity) so called 3D Audio recordings (Amazon Music supports Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio spatial audio formats). If you don’t get the Amazon Music HD package ($12.99 monthly with Prime / $14.99 without), then you will be missing out on what these speakers are designed to deliver. Amazon’s Ultra HD music must be heard on a system that supports it to be appreciated. It truly is something else in audio quality, significantly better sounding than any CD or LP. And Amazon Music’s catalog is growing by leaps and bounds every month. It is currently quite vast, even its Classical Music selection which has exploded in the two years since the Echo Studio was introduced.Using the Amazon Echo Link ($140), you could get this same quality streaming audio (or even better depending on your amp and speakers) for an existing Hi-Fi setup (at least I think you can- there seems to be some confusion about whether it supports the full 24-bit/192kHz Ultra HD), although you could not get 3D Audio with the Link. You could also use the Echo Link to attach any other sub-woofer to your Echo Studio pair but that would also require an additional amplifier thrown in. However, if you don’t have that Hi-Fi system already, these (2 paired Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) are the way to go to take full advantage of Amazon Music HD at a very favorable price. Just compare their cost to that of a good Hi-Fi system consisting of amplifier, pre-amp, two speakers and a sub-woofer as well as the Echo Link you’d need. The Echo speakers here are a definite bargain for getting excellent audio with minimal wires or fuss!"
"The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless.  I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine."
"This is the second Echo and it works great. The first Echo the screen would go totally off and she was hard to wake up at that point. I let Amazon know and this one arrived the next day. I still have the old one but do not trust it. Excellent Customer Service."
"The Amazon Echo Show 5 is a fantastic little device that packs a surprising punch for its size. The sound quality has noticeably improved from earlier versions, with deeper bass and clearer audio that works well for music, videos, and even alarms. The 5-inch display is sharp and bright, perfect for quick glances at weather updates, recipes, or video calls without taking up much space.The Alexa integration is seamless, as always, and I’ve been using it for everything from setting timers to controlling smart home devices. The camera shutter for privacy is a thoughtful touch, and the device is easy to set up and customize.If I had to nitpick, the screen size might feel limiting if you’re looking for a larger display for streaming or detailed visuals. Also, the speaker is great for its size but not quite room-filling if you’re expecting full stereo quality.Overall, it’s an excellent choice for someone looking for a compact, versatile smart display. Whether it’s for your nightstand, kitchen counter, or office desk, this Echo Show delivers great features and sound in a sleek, affordable package."
"This is my first foray into this technology.  I appreciate the interactive screen [always clear and readable], it has good sound for such a small unit, and was user friendly to setup. I really enjoy the 'hands-off' control of systems in and around the house. A lot neat 'accessories' to control items that I would never thought [but they know I need them]."
"Update to below original review:  Amazon tech support reached out to me to help fix this problem.  So, I have increased from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Still not 5 stars because there is a device problem somewhere.  In addition, I believe the Echo Dot (no screen) is a better device - it ""hears"" better and has better sound.  If you run into the Echo Show going into zombie mode (where it appears to be rebooting, powering off, and repeating a doom loop over and over), try the following:- Put it into factory default mode by holding Mute and Volume Down for 30 seconds until you see three dots appear on the screen.  It should enter setup at this point and if it works after setting it up, good.- If you get through the setup process and parts of it repeat over and over, cycle power for one minute and try again.  This second step was necessary for me but it works now.Thanks, Amazon support!Original review: It never did pick up voice commands a well as our other Alexa devices.  Sound is so-so; the dot is far better.  In less than a year, it recently failed.  It tries to boot up, shuts off, and the cycle continues.  Not what I was hoping for."
"It won't respond to my commands sometimesI want it play George Jones and it just stays silent."
"I've been using the Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.**Sound Quality:**One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.**Display and Design:**The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.**Privacy and Security:**Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.**Overall Performance:**The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos."
"It does what it advertises. I’m very happy with the product.!😁"
"Makes the echo easier to use and looks good."
"The stand is a no brainer as it allows the screen to be easily seen especially in the dark."
"Upgraded from a regular echo to this in kitchen. Love it, especially having visual reminders of any timers set, being able to watch movies etc. only downside is no Netflix."
"Very Happy with this product. Will recommend. Thank You"
"This is the best speaker I purchased. It is way louder than expected. Well worth the money. You will not be disappointed. Easy to use. Small and portable. Clear and functions perfectly."
"I was given this speaker as a gift and immediately wanted to share this awesome little giant with others. The ease of use and portability is wonderful. Its capability to fill a room with pure, clean, robust sound is impressive. I have Bose speakers in my auto and home to play CDs but had no way to get that wonderful sound for listening to a play list from my phone. I was surprised that something so small and inexpensive could play with such pure sound. Easily rechargeable and long duration of power. It is light weight and doesn’t take up a lot of space. Definitely recommend this product for young and old to enjoy !"
"I bought this blue tooth speaker for my show car that doesn't have a stereo. I own 2 Bose portable speakers and got this because of the good price. Wow! It does not disappoint! Music sounds great, easy to pair with my iPhone and has a fun color display. OK, the Bose speakers are little squares, smaller and a different shape than this speaker, but not a deal breaker. Also, a friend uses hers as a speaker for phone calls. I haven't tried that because I'm more interested in using it for music. It's a nice speaker."
"I recently purchased a pair of Bluetooth speakers to enhance my home viewing experience, particularly for connecting to my TV and creating a more theater-like atmosphere. While I encountered some challenges with connectivity to my Onn TV, the overall performance and quality of these speakers have left me quite satisfied. Here’s a detailed review based on my experience.Setup and ConnectivityThe initial setup of the Bluetooth speakers was straightforward and user-friendly. Connecting them to my other TV was a breeze; I simply powered on the speakers, activated Bluetooth on the TV, and they paired instantly. However, I did face issues connecting them to my Onn TV. I suspect this is due to compatibility limitations with the TV itself rather than a fault with the speakers. For anyone considering these speakers, it’s worth checking your device’s compatibility to avoid similar issues.Sound QualityOnce connected, the sound quality of these Bluetooth speakers truly impressed me. They deliver rich, clear audio that significantly enhances the viewing experience. The bass is robust without being overwhelming, providing a well-rounded sound profile that makes movies and music come alive. Whether I was watching action-packed films or listening to music, the audio clarity and depth exceeded my expectations for speakers in this price range.Design and Build QualityThe design of the speakers is sleek and modern, fitting well into any home decor. They are compact enough to not take up too much space but still powerful enough to fill a room with sound. The build quality feels solid, which gives me confidence in their durability over time.Price PointOne of the most appealing aspects of these Bluetooth speakers is their affordability. At under $10, they offer exceptional value for money compared to many other options on the market. There are certainly more expensive speakers available that boast additional features or brand prestige, but for someone looking for quality sound without breaking the bank, these speakers are an excellent choice.ConclusionIn conclusion, while I did encounter some connectivity issues with one of my TVs, the overall performance of these Bluetooth speakers has been highly satisfactory. They provide excellent sound quality, are easy to set up, and come at an unbeatable price point. With so many Bluetooth speaker options available today, finding one that balances quality and affordability can be challenging, but these speakers do just that. I would recommend them to anyone looking to enhance their audio experience at home without spending a fortune. Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase!"
"This is a terrific speaker.  It connects easily, and it sounds great.  I keep it in my shower so I can listen to music or the news.  I have quite a few small bluetooth speakers, and this one is my favorite.That being said, a few weeks after I purchased it, suddenly the speaker wouldn't power off.  It just stayed on.  When I disconnected my phone from it, it would stay in pairing mode with its blue light flashing.  This honestly didn't really bother me -- I just paired my phone to it the next day and it worked fine.  The problem came when the battery was dying.  It started beeping incessantly to alert that it needed charging, so then I had to run to plug it in to stop the beeping.  This got old REALLY fast.  I contacted the seller, and another speaker was promptly sent to me.Terrific speaker, terrific price, terrific customer service.  You can't go wrong with this speaker."
"This powerful little speaker packs a big punch! Very well made of very sturdy material. Has pretty good bass, nice mid tones, clear high tones...sounds great with jazz, classical, pop, soca, hip-hop, tribal house. Easy Bluetooth connection, light weight and extremely portable, lights up cycling different colors when playing and a long lasting battery charge."
"I have the unfortunate task of needing to clear out my parents' estate. There are a few large shop buildings on the property and they're all full of stuff that needs to be sorted through, trash tossed, and everything else readied for auction. This means long hours over several months, and I really need music to distract me while I work. I was able to get by just on my phone speaker, but when the weather turned hot, I had to employ some fans and the ambient sound was drowning out my phone. So off to Amazon I went in search of a speaker that could boost my music. I opted for this speaker by, BolaButty, and I'm really glad I did.The sound is incredible! Clarity is great, volume level caries over the droning of large fans, and I have had no issues at all with connectivity. The lights really aren't my thing, but they're neat and work well. Battery life is enough to get me through at least a twelve hour day, which is helpful. I also noticed that the speaker shuts down after several minutes of not being used, so if you forget to turn it off, it's no big deal.I can easily recommend this BolaButty speaker if you need to boost the volume of your music for whatever situation you may need."
"The Amazon Echo Show 8 strikes the perfect balance between functionality and performance. The 8-inch display is large enough for watching shows, following recipes, or making video calls, yet compact enough to fit on a kitchen counter or nightstand. The spatial audio is a standout feature, delivering rich and immersive sound that fills the room, making it ideal for music or video playback.As a smart home hub, it’s incredibly convenient. I’ve synced it with various smart devices, and Alexa makes controlling them seamless. The camera’s auto-framing feature during video calls is a thoughtful addition, keeping me centered without needing adjustments. The built-in privacy controls, like the camera shutter and microphone mute button, offer peace of mind.If there’s a downside, it’s the slightly higher price compared to smaller models like the Echo Show 5. Additionally, while the sound is impressive, audiophiles might find it falls short of dedicated speakers.Overall, this device is an excellent choice for anyone wanting a versatile smart display that handles entertainment, productivity, and home automation with ease. It’s become an essential part of my daily routine!"
"The Amazon Echo Show 8 (newest model) has completely transformed how I manage my home and stay entertained. The spatial audio is impressive—clear and immersive whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or using it for video calls. The screen size is just right for reading recipes, watching shows, or checking the weather without taking up too much counter space.The built-in smart home hub is a game-changer. I can now control my lights, thermostat, and cameras with ease, all from one device. Alexa is responsive and intuitive, making it easy to set reminders, check my schedule, or ask random questions while multitasking.The Glacier White finish blends beautifully with my kitchen decor, and the setup was straightforward. If you’re looking to upgrade your smart home or just want a reliable assistant, this is the perfect choice. Highly recommend it!"
"These are pretty cool. We use them for my kids room, our bathroom and my parents use in their kitchen. They work well in all locations. The moisture in the bathroom has not created any issues and I get it steamy a lot. The volume and sound quality are great for the price and there is no more delay than any other electronic. I am able to get it to connect to our receiver to stream to the speakers in the bathroom for improved sound. The video is what I was looking for and it’s been knocked off the counter a few times and still works great. For the cost this is a great product that I will most likely buy more of. The features are great and being able to see your answers you would normally ask Alexa on the screen is a game changer on occasions. I highly recommend buying if you are looking for an upgrade to the dots."

Riddle: What do you call an ""Echo Show 8"" when its display isn't working? -You call it simply an ""expensive Echo 8""!I've had the display on my new Show 8 (gen. 3) stop working twice in the 3 weeks I've owned and used it. Since this is not my first Echo Show (I've owned 5 of them over the last 4 years, including the 3 I still have now), and I know this display problem is not normal. A reboot (unplugging then replugging in the electrical power) restored the display the first time. This second occurrence of the problem left me concerned: how often can I expect this issue to resurface, and does it just indicate a hardware defect in my unit? So I made the accompanying video so that you could see what I'm referring to.It turns out that telling Alexa to ""Turn Off display"" while it's having this malfunction (while the display is black and the Display is non-responsive but while the device still responds audibly) And then saying ""Alexa"" (the wake word) restored the display and its responsiveness (to touch and verbal commands).But I don't think that's a permanent fix.Amazon customer support did advise toggling off the Auto Sleep setting in the device. This might be an acknowledgement of a software bug in that feature, but if it is, it's not afflicting my other Show (a current generation Show 10) that's using Auto Sleep.Except for the above, I do like my third generation Show 8 for the quality of its sound, responsiveness, overall utility (alarms, podcast-listening, news briefs, clock, timers, display of weather conditions, calendar events, home automation of smart lights and smart plugs for fans/+, hours and phone numbers of local retailers, etc.), and the display - when it's functioning properly!My Show 8 (gen. 3) did have one other problem during my first 3 weeks of using it: Increasingly, I needed to repeat the wake word (""Alexa"") to get the Show 8's attention. So I positioned my other Show 8 (gen. 1) near it on the same table and asked them both the same question - first the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8, then the ""gen 1"" Show 8 (which uses ""Echo"" as it's wake word). Then I listened to the Voice Activity in the Alexa app on my phone. There was considerable Distortion in the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8's recording, while the recording of the old (gen. 1) was remarkably clear. The short story is that Amazon customer support recommended the obligatory reboot, and that ""fixed"" it - for now, at least. (There was a theory that there may have been an external cause, but my testing has been unable to find evidence of that.)"
"I already had the Echo Show 5, but I LOVE the bigger screen size of the Show 8! Having the ability to turn it into a scrolling picture frame is also a really nice feature! It’s easy to read my notifications, easy to see things like cameras when I need to check them - on the larger screen! It’s easy to use with voice controls, physical buttons & the Alexa App. The Speakers are definitely AWESOME- this little guy packs a HUGE punch when playing music or watching a video! Definitely worth the price! It’s quick & easy to set up & links to your Amazon account & Alexa App! You won’t regret this purchase"
"I was able to connect all smart devices to it, even other brands."

Tiene buen sonido me encantó!!😍"
"Picked up the Echo Show 8 3rd generation in the US in March because it took pretty much a year to be released in Canada. Hugely better than the second generation. Significantly better sound quality for music. Responds much quicker to requests. Works great for viewing the camera for the Blink video doorbell. Love the rotating photo option. My favourite Echo ever."
"To give a bit of background I am an audiophile (a lover of music) and take my music quite seriously. I run some serious hardware from meze elite epoque headphones to legacy signature speakers. I say all this to give a bit of credit to my background on sound and knowing where a good set of transducers can take you.I recently changed my bedroom audio setup to move my floor standing speakers (old wharfedale diamond 9.5's) to acomidate my tv. This had the drawback of removing them from my echo and I needed a solution to provide the room with ""good enough"" audio that the little echo just could not muster. So I started my search for a new all in one voice assistant but did not want a second set of tower speakers in the room so I looked at the usual suspects. The echo studio, sonos, etc but none of them had what I was looking for when it came to sound quality. Enter the jbl 500 it was not on my radar at all but I stumbled across it in my searching. It had mixed reviews with an emphasis on the size of the speaker. Now for me coming from a set of tower speakers size was not the limiting factor. So I ordered one and had it at my door in no time at all. This guy was well packed and had a good presentation my only complaint is that the bass driver is exposed and you have to be cognizant not to put a finger through it as you lift it out of the box. This speaker has a good amount of weight for its size and feels well built. Physical setup is a breeze with one power cable and you are done. After that you need the app which is not the best but definitely not the worst I have used. In the app you will connect it to your wifi and then setup your voice assistants. This guy supports both google and alexa with the former being very easy to setup and the latter being a oddity. The google setup punched right in like any other google home device and setup was a breeze. The alexa app on the other hand just opened to a spinning circle with no errors. After contacting tech support I tried everything under the sun to get it to take and somewhere along the line fixed it. I am not sure if it was a wifi bug or just needed to run in for some time but after I tried the next day everything popped right in no problem.Now on to the sound... good golly this was not what I was expecting! This guy goes to show what modern tech has brought to the table vs my older diamond speakers. I started it on some tash music because I was not expecting much from this guy but what came belting out from this box was clean powerful sound. My first stop was ""the used - in love and death"" and there it was a musical tonality that I would described as playful or V shaped. The bass was plentiful but not overwhelming, solidly in the fun category but not drifting into bloated or slow territory. In short it sounded good, darn good... better than it had rights to sound given its size. So intrigued I switched from background music to my analytical music section to see if this was some kind of fluke. I popped on one of my favorites the live copy of ""Fink - troubles what you are in"" and gave this speaker my full attention. This speaker did not shirk from my critical ear as the acoustic guitar was crisp and you could distinctly pick out the difference between the sounds of his palm on the wood vs the cajon. I was gobsmacked, baffled, dare I say impressed. I tossed the kitchen sink of all the greats (steely dan, daftpunk, pinkfloyd, etc) at this box and it continued to impress. I was left wondering if I toss the diamonds in favor of picking up another one of these it is THAT GOOD. The fact that a single six inch driver could come even close to the range that four drivers of the same size is witchcraft.I love the sound profile that this uses with the heavy V shape. To me this is one of my favorites as it sets the toes a tapping and head a bobbing more than that holy grale flat profile. I would compare this to the fiio FH9 as something that I turn on and go ""that sounds right"" no tweaking or changes it just sounds like my ideal of what I want from music.If you made it this far into the review I commend you! If you just scrolled to the end for the TLDR buy it you wont be dissapointed."
"Not cheap, but a great sounding speaker for the size. Of course, you're not going to get a stereo image out of a single speaker, but it sounds good for what it is. We have it on the counter in our kitchen, and I use it while cooking and eating. More than powerful enough to be heard over the super loud downdraft exhaust fan on our stove when cooking. I'm a recording/mixing/mastering engineer, so I'm picky about sound. Sure, this is not as good sounding as my studio monitors, but it serves its purpose and is much less expensive and smaller than my studio monitors.I'm using primarily Amazon Music which it has built-in support for (among several other services), and there are no issues with that for the most part. Once in a while I have to login again to my Amazon account. Or, on rare occasions, this speaker gets disconnected from the network, but is easily fixed by simply unplugging and plugging in again. It does have a wired ethernet connection if you want a more reliable network connection, but I didn't have an ethernet port nearby and the wifi signal where the speaker is located is not great.The main reason I got this type of speaker is that it streams directly from the services via WiFi, as opposed to a cheaper Bluetooth only speaker that would use the lower quality Bluetooth audio format. So, with Amazon Music HD, you can get at least CD quality, lossless audio, which is important to me. You can set it up for Alexa to use voice commands to start streaming from Amazon music, or you can use the Amazon Music App on your phone to connect to the speaker and stream in HD (as opposed to Bluetooth), as the speaker will still do the streaming itself and the phone is just the interface. The JBL One app is nice for setting this up and for control volume and such, but it misses out on some features of the Amazon music app, such as the ability to shuffle a playlist."
"Purchased 2 on sale and use as a secondary system in the house in stereo mode. They are excellent! Great bass, mids and highs!After numerous models I have finally settled on this. The ease of use and superb sound quality as well as the retro look made the decision easy. Not cheap but well worth it if you appreciate sound quality above all. I did not want the battery model....I have others for portable use and the size is perfect.Having the wifi option was a dealer maker for me! Playback from Tidal in FLAC is much better than Bluetooth!If you are willing to spend the money, 2 in stereo mode is incredible.....don't hesitate."
"These speakers pack a punch. I only need to keep the volume at 20% and the sound fills the room. Excellent frequency range. I like how it has knobs to adjust treble & bass. I did have a bit of interruption when using the AirPlay mode from an M1 Macbook but that might be from my WiFi connection. Playing music via Bluetooth was fine. Using the AUX input was much more reliable."
"JbL has a reputation for making good subs, at least they made the best when I was in school 99-2000.  The speaker is heavy and seems well made, should be for the price.. but all in all I‚Äôm quite happy with the performance"
"These speakers produce great, deep sounds that fill the room. I recommend this model for rooms up to about 200 sqft. Rooms larger than that will require the next model in the Sonos product line.The setup was straightforward, and linking Apple Music was simple. I have three speakers (in the kitchen, living room, and dining room) and love how straightforward it is to select individual speakers and adjust the volume of each room through the Sonos app.The design is very minimalistic, making it perfect for concealing the speaker in your room. People often wonder where the music is coming from because it fills the room, but it's hard to pinpoint where the speaker is.Great product! It has high-quality sound, is easy to set up and use, and has a solid build."
"I already have 2 Era 100's and a Sub mini in my Family room. They sound fantastic.  Some times I like to sit in my Living room and read, or meditate. But I would turn the volume up in the family room so I could hear those speakers. So I decided to get a third  Era 100 for my living room. I put it on a small decorative shelf.  I must say it is everything I imagined it would be. When setting it up I didn't know I could turn off selected speakers. This was a unexpected plus for me. So if I am in my living room I could just have the one Era 100 speaker play and vice versa. Or I could have all three and the sub mini playing at the same time. After having the 2 Era 100's and Sub mini for a couple of months now, I had forgotten how good just 1 Era 100 speaker sound. I did notice the two Era 100's paired with the sub sound more clear and crisp than the single Era 100's. That's because the Sub mini is using the low that the Era 100's would had normally played. Great concept in sound and speakers.  I just turned the treble up a little bit more in the single Era 100 to get more highs. Sounds good. It's too bad Sonos doesn't allow for multiple Sub minis connected in the same group, it would be phenomenal. I had read somewhere that it wasn't cost effective for the consumer to buy 2 Sub minis when 1 Gen 3 Sub woofer has more output than two Sub minis. I say who cares Sonos? If a consumer wants to spend their money on a second Sub mini and put in in another room in the same speaker group it's their prerogative. If that's true then their business model doesn't make since to me. Set up was a breeze too. Because I didn't use a tutorial to set this up, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to select the speaker, because at first the single Era 100 didn't play although it was connected.  But the setup was a breeze. Very easy. I may get another Era 100 (this time used) and put it in my kitchen and I'll have sound throughout all of downstairs. I've been fortunate to not have problems with the app, unlike many others. I am very impressed and satisfied."
"I spent 45 minutes on hold for TWO DIFFERENT customer service calls. Each call ended up being TWO hours long. The set up is not easy. At first it was and I thought I was good to go, but with the App updates several of my speakers could not get connected/registered to my Sonos System. I am working with Sonos Era, Sonos Play, and Sonos Roam speakers. I had to start restart my router and phone multiple times and factory rest all the speakers. Some wouldn't even Factory Reset. One Customer Service Lady said that my Router was the issue and I needed to call Spectrum and have them manually reset it fromWiFE6 default bandwidth 802.11 AXN because my bandwith is not supported by Sonos.  WHAT???!!! That's a serious design issue. So I called Spectrum and of course their routers are unable to do the thing that Sonos needs. So they reccomended I buy a Dual Band Router. Now COME ON! Do I really want to do that? So I called Sonos Customer Service again, waited 45 minutes on hold. Then we were able to get all my speakers correctly set up to the system and everything was playing correctly. For one hour. Then the music stopped out of nowhere. The phone was near the router and I didn't touch anything. Now it's stuck in Glitch mode. I was able to get it to play music but the App isn't displaying that the speakers are playing anything and its giving me an Error Message saying Unable to Work. Try again. Well for a brand whose whole gimmick is ease of set up and use, this is a total Fail. Am most likely going to return them all which is unfortunate because the sound is great."
"I love Sonos speakers. I have the Sonos surround sound in my living room, but I didn't have it in my bathroom where I used to listen to the radio while getting ready in the morning. The radio didn't have the talk show that I liked so I stopped the radio part. I decided to give myself an early Christmas gift and purchase a Sonos speaker for my bathroom and listen to whatever music I wanted to by subscribing to Amazon Music. I also purchased an Echo Dot (Alexa) and just tell her what I want to listen to and I love it. The sound is absolutely wonderful. I'm a very happy 86 year old woman."
"I listen to music for a large part of the day at home.  I have had a jam box for 8-9 yrs and thought it was the best until I got the Sonos!! The quality, the bass is just a step above the jam box!  What I don’t like about it… it is not battery operated for portability and it doesn’t stay connected to my iPhone.  So every time I use it I have to connect to my phone and who knows, that could be something I’m doing wrong. Anyway, just an extra step for me to use it which it’s so worth it in my opinion.  I highly recommend this speaker if you are a music lover!"
"I run two of these with a Sonos sub-woofer electronically coupled to one of them.  I have them configured in two different connected rooms with Spotify over my phone through our WIFI network so they play simultaneously and fill the rooms with really nice sound - surprisingly good actually for such small units.I do recommend adding a  Sonos sub-woofer (I used a sub-mini) to fill out the tones and the rooms.  It isn't cheap but is well work the money.FYI - the Sonos app isn't particularly intuitive or helpful in my view but you can get around it once installed and setup on your network by working directly through Spotify by selecting the Sonos speakers as your output device."
"Loud quality sound in a small package. Simple set up with the Sonos app and fast delivery. Great value, especially at sale price"
"This USB hub is a fantastic investment! It's not only sleek and stylish with its aluminum housing, but it also performs exceptionally well. I was initially concerned about overheating issues, but this hub's design effectively dissipates heat, ensuring reliable performance.The high-speed USB ports are incredibly fast, allowing for rapid data transfers between devices. Whether you're connecting multiple peripherals or transferring large files, this hub handles it all with ease. The HDMI port delivers crystal-clear video output, making it perfect for extending your workspace."
"This USB-C hub has been an excellent addition to my workstation. Since I connected it to my laptop, I've noticed a significant improvement in port versatility and data transfer speed. It comes with multiple ports, including HDMI, USB-A ports and a USB-C charging port, allowing me to connect all my devices without worrying about running out of space.The best part is how compact and lightweight it is. I can carry it everywhere in my backpack without it taking up much space, which is perfect for those of us who are always on the go."
"This is a nice, solid piece of equipment - aluminum, not plastic. It has made my laptop usable once again."
"All the ports work well, and it is easy to use. I have only been using it for a few days, so I don't know how long it can be useful. I hope Ugreen items are always used for a long time."
"Works very well. Plugs into my Windows 11 laptop ... gives me additional USB ports for my other peripheral devices. I don't personally make use of the ethernet port on it, as I'm always on WiFi, but it is nice to know it is available if needed. Recommended!"
"Great product and faster delivery"
"Great functionality and does what is needed. It is truly plug and play and works great to hook up my tv to my laptop. Great purchase."
"I purchased this hub to replace my 1.5 years old cheap hub which was working fine. I decided to buy this one since it had 2 usb C ports, 2 usb A ports and an hdmi. My last hub only had 1x usb A  1x usb c and 1 hdmi. So I wanted to have extra ports. I recieved it a month ago and used it for 3 weeks to connect my screen, nvme ssd enclosure and my usbC headphones while working at the office. Out of the blue it stopped recognizing my enclosure and my headphones. I went ahead and tried it on different devices and different usb sticks and cables and it seems that the usb ports on the docking station seized to work. I have a couple of ugreen products and I'm disappointed that it stopped working in less than a month. Had to switch to my old Reliable hub."
"Was very excited to receive this USB-C hub as we wanted to mirror our tablets to the TV. Our previous efforts of mirroring wirelessly failed as there was too much latency/lag so the audio was out of sync.The hub was smaller than I expected, and was very solid. The metal shell was visually perfect and had an air of luxury... While the hub was small, the packaging was larger than required... this isn't a bad or good thing as the packaging seemed quite capable of protecting the item. There was an instruction manual of sorts in the box but besides looking at the diagram, I recycled everything immediately. Its a USB-C hub... it ain't rocket science.Of our 2 tablets that we use for media consumption, only the Samsung S7 FE worked. After some googling, I noted that Samsung downgraded the S9 FE to not output video through USB. Hopefully this tidbit can save some grief for others.Right as I connected the Samsung S7 FE to the hub, and the hub to the HDMI cable, the TV outputted a picture immediately. Because of the tablet's resolution, there were ever so slight black bars on both SIDES of the TV. This wasn't too much of a distraction, but food for thought for some of you.Scrolling through the desktop and apps yielded nothing out of the ordinary. I played Disney+ and Jellyfin (think Plex) on it and the picture was beautiful with no perceptible latency/lag. The only caveat was a bit of jitter - think not a perfectly smooth picture, but every few seconds not constant. I'm not sure if it is because of my 4 or 5 year old Sony TV, a handshake problem, the wrong HDMI port on the TV, an HDMI cable issue or something in between. Would it be enough to bother some people? Definitely yes. Does it bother me at all? No. For all I know, this could be a setup issue on my TV... I'll try changing some modes and other things later.I haven't tried attaching power or any storage devices, and quite frankly don't think that I ever will. We will be solely using this to watch Netflix on our TV as we borrow someone's Netflix account, so we can't play Netflix on the TV directly.From the various reviews that I have read, most people indicate this is a reputable brand. From my limited time using this specific item, I have to concur.Is this priced too high or too low? Well, if you can get this on a slight sale, then it is a solid product that does what it promises."
"I have an Asus Zenbook that's at least 7 years old (ancient by technology standards) and it has a very problematic USB hub. I love my laptop. It functions well except for the hub. I usually get OEM peripherals for my electronics. (I use PC and Android. I'm not a Mac/Apple user.)In the case of the USB hub for my Zenbook the Asus replacement hub is garbage with a 1 star review on Asus website with warnings not to buy because of how fast it stops working. The Asus hub I purchased 3 months ago stopped working after using it 3 or 4 times. That's unacceptable in my opinion. I have tried other brands including Belkin, Anker and 2 others that I do not remember. None of them would deliver power to my laptop despite claiming they would. So I decided to try this hub. I need an external hub for the multiple USB ports because the Asus has no ports on the Zenbook itself, and power delivery (in a perfect world when everything works properly) should also be able to go thru the hub to charge the laptop. On my laptop, there's only one USB-C port to connect either direct power supply or a hub. You can't have both connected at the same time unless the hub allows power transfer to laptop, which the other brand hubs that I tried wouldn't support that power transfer, much to my frustration. This hub is the first hub that I've tried that will actually power my laptop. (I also switched my power supply cable to a Thunderbolt, so the combination of the new cable with this hub works.) I use a wireless mouse with a dongle that needs to be plugged in. I have a digital voice recorder that plugs in directly via USB-A to transfer files to the laptop. I use SD cards in my camera and MP3 player that I need a hub to transfer that media onto the laptop. This hub will allow all of that. Every port works that I have tried on this Acer hub and this hub does the thing that the other hubs failed to do on my laptop. The power transfer was the big issue for me and this Acer hub solved the problem that several others including the OEM, Asus, failed to do. Because of how many months I have been dealing with the power supply problem, hubs not delivering what they promised and this being the only hub that did work, I rate this product at 5 stars. It's less expensive than the Asus hub that stops working immediately after purchasing. It has more ports than the Asus hub with the extra SD card reader that the Asus hub doesn't have. It's a heavier duty outer shell compared to the Asus. The cord is thicker and better protected compared to the Asus, so it reduces the chance for stressing or bending the cord in a way that could break the wires inside or break the connector away from the wires. It's just a better design overall, when compared to the Asus hub. I am extremely satisfied with this Acer hub and I would recommend it since it did the ""impossible"" task that no other brand could do for me. 5 stars, indeed."
"This hub does it all. Two USB A in great locations and work well. Two USB C arewell placed and I especially love the one that is able to charge a laptop (100w I think) and still work as a normal USB as well. HDMI is in a great location and easy to use. Short cord powering the hub is the perfect length to connect to everything. Love this HUB!"
"I tried it on my laptop and it does great. Card reader works but only one at the time (either the microSD/TF or the Big SD like the microSD in the SD adapter) The only con is you only get up to 30hz on my laptop when you are in 4K resolution. Others like 1080p and 720p have 60hz on my TV.But the main reason that I made the right purchase is for the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro. It charges flawlessly and HDMI out really works and I can connect my keyboard/mouse unifying reciever and/or a controller via USB. It really works! So now my handheld android gaming console can also be a home console like the switch. Worth the buy. Highly recommend."
"Device seems to work well, it's a good size, seems to be sturdy and allows multiple different connections... however I purchased this because I needed the ability to charge my device while also using my AR glasses.... but the USB-C port does not allow for that, so I will need to return it."
"Its a very practical gadget and easy to carry."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



2nd EDIT: Not only did the company offer a refund, they also generously shipped me another unit, and it works just as it should! They gave fast responses when the first unit gave me issues, and addressed it as well as you possibly could. I would use them any time!EDIT: the company quickly reached out and offered a full refund as a result of a faulty product. For me, that goes a long way. I have plenty of ACER products and normally have no issues with them. could have just been a faulty single product.Very bummed. For the first 2 hours of use it worked great. When it’s just USB-C to HDMI connected it works fine, but the second I go to plug my Mac in, while using the HDMI to stream to my monitor, the screen begins flashing every second or two on both my Mac, and the monitor. The flashing screen is happening at the same time the Mac keeps making its “chime” that the charger is connected, over and over again. Clearly something is going on that the charging is not staying active. whenever the charger is first connected it causes a quick(ish)black screen, which I could live with if it just happened right as I plugged the charger in… but when the charger KEEPS thinkings it’s just getting plugged in over and over, and keeps flashing, it kind of makes the product useless. And I’ve already thrown the box away so I guess I’m stuck with a product that doesn’t work. Super bummer."
"Convenient, with multiple ports to expand your computer use.  Works flawlessly."
"The new computer has a usb c that needs this adapter for hdmi connection. This works perfectly."
"I was skeptical of this little unit but I figured for the price, why not.  I've been pleasantly surprised. It feels solidly built and very sleek.  It worked right away as it connected automatically (as per my Dex Setting) and it's working just fine.  I'm actually typing this review with the unit right now.It works with my wireless keyboard and I plugged in an wired mouse as well.  When plugged in, it also charges my phone... slowly, but it does charge.So far I have no comlaints.  I hope it lasts. 5 stars!"
"Well made usb hub. Plug it into your computer and have all the ports of a gaming laptop.  Good value for money and it's not let me down yet. Ive only used it for my thermal printer so far,so I can't comment on heat levels. I'm happy with it."
"This is a wonderful little hub that gets the job done affordably and with a smaller footprint than other big boxes that sit on your desk. However, I learned a few things about the shortcomings of my Dell Latitude 3540 that comes with a Factory Power supply 65 W adapter: It won't work with a hub that consumes its own power for your peripherals.The problem was that the 65W Dell charger that came with my laptop is not powerful enough to power the hub AND provide sufficient power to the laptop. When i used the Anker hub with the factory supplied adapter, the hub sucks off 15 W for mouse, keyboard, etc., leaving the laptop only 40W. The laptop power manager kept complaining that it was starving. I solved this problem by buying a more powerful charging adapter. (https://a.co/d/0be3Lwti) This is a problem with my Dell, not the Anker hub. (Btw, this Dell latitude uses a PD port, which didn't work with my $300 Thinkpad lightning 4 hub, which is why i bought this less expensive Anker.)Now that it's working, it's great! It's tiny, easy to plug in and works immediately, even as i switch from conference room back to my desk. No hiccups or blurps and my computer doesn't need a moment to recognize its new reality each time i plug/unplug.Anker customer support was fantastic. I love this brand and will continue to favor it for price and reliability."
"The **Anker 332 USB-C Hub (5-in-1)** has been a fantastic addition to my tech setup! It’s compact, easy to carry, and provides all the essential ports I need for work and entertainment. The **4K HDMI display** port works flawlessly, allowing me to connect my laptop to an external monitor or TV with crystal-clear resolution and no lag.The **two 5Gbps USB-A data ports** are super fast, making file transfers quick and efficient. I’ve used them to connect my external hard drive and a USB mouse simultaneously, and both worked without any hiccups. The hub is well-built and feels durable, with solid connections that don’t feel loose or flimsy.This hub is a must-have for anyone looking to expand their laptop's connectivity options, especially if you need extra USB-A ports or HDMI output. It’s **plug-and-play**, no drivers required, and works seamlessly with both my MacBook and Windows laptop. Highly recommend this Anker hub for anyone in need of a reliable, compact solution for extra ports!"
"The Anker 5-in-1 hub is perfect to connect my phone to my monitor and keyboard, so that I can use the phone more easily when typing long text messages or other entries. It is well made, looks great, and works well. I do need to connect a USB-C power cable to the hub for using the monitor, but the side benefit is that it charges the phone while I’m using the hub.The only issue I had was that there was no User Manual included, and the QR code on the box did not take me to a location where I could download the manual. I sent an email to Anker and they responded the next day with the link to the manual. I was also impressed that the manufacturer contacted me the following day to ensure I had everything I needed. A nice follow through!I’m pleased with the product and look forward to using it with my phone."
"Handy and reliable, sticks by Anker's product quality and trust. Can be used efficiently with laptops supporting USB C ports. Works great with apple laptops like MacBook air and MacBook pro. No glitches in connection to HDMI ports. All the ports can be used simultaneously and there are no slowness or any issue observed. Good pricing too for this excellent product. Probably missing audio jack (3.5mm) other than that it is a great product that support simultaneous charging also."
"I was a bit nervous about buying this product, as it doesn't mention explicitly that it works with Samsung DEX, and USB OTG can be a bit wonky. However, I'm happy to report that it works fantastic with Samsung DEX (I paired it with a Galaxy S21 Base Model).I have a funny workstation set up where I have this attached to my phone, using passthrough charging, connected to a wireless keyboard and mouse, all attached to a portable HDMI monitor. Outside of the novelty of using my phone as a desktop, it has the added benefit of having way more battery life than my laptop, and being able to charge from a relatively slow USB connection.Overall, if you have a phone that can use USB OTG, I recommend getting this just to have a good way to connect your phone to your TV. Solid product all around."
"I am using the hub to connect a Dell XPS 13 to a 4K HDMI monitor (TV). I was having problems with the hub shutting off after a couple hours. Upon consulting with Anker Support, I discovered that the standard wall adapter for the Dell XPS 13--a 45W adapter--is not powerful enough to sustain powering the hub when connected to a 4K HDMI video monitor. From Support: ""The hub's USB-C PD port supports charging from 53W to 85W, and it's recommended to use a PD wall charger that is 12W to 15W stronger than your original one. Therefore, using a higher wattage power supply within the supported range (53W to 85W) should help keep the hub powered consistently.""It was not a problem for me to purchase a 100W wall charger from Dell to resolve the issue. Since then, the hub works fine. While I am very happy with the hub, I wish the marketing copy/product description here and on Anker's Web site would have spelled out the wall adapter requirements more explicitly. I could have saved my time and Anker Support's time troubleshooting.Otherwise, the hub is just what I need; since adding an adequate wall adapter, it works great."
"Amazing hub, transformed my MacBook into super computer. Light weight, small and solid hub."
"The Anker 332 USB-C Hub has been a revelation for my MacBook experience, providing a seamless and versatile way to connect all my peripherals and devices.This 5-in-1 hub is incredibly compact yet packed with features that have greatly enhanced my productivity and workflow.The 4K HDMI display output is stunning, allowing me to connect my laptop to a larger screen or projector with ease.The two 5Gbps USB-A data ports provide ample storage and charging capabilities, making it easy to transfer files or charge multiple devices at once. I've also appreciated the ability to connect my headphones or speakers via the hub's dedicated audio jack, freeing up my laptop's built-in port for other uses.Overall, this Anker interface has become an indispensable tool in my daily workflow, providing a reliable and convenient way to expand my MacBook's capabilities without sacrificing portability or ease of use."
"Very useful for my MacBook pro"
"needed an extra hub, everything in it works well"
"I have an Anker 4-Port USB 3.0 Data Hub to USB-C that holds my Keyboard, Mouse and Anker Ethernet adapter plugged into it. It was a hassle having to unplug this to charge my iPad Pro on a separate charging cord. . So this Anker Charging and Data Hub did the trick!  Just plug my 4 port into one of the data ports and plug my USB-C charging cord into the charging port. Voila! Works like a charm!Update: I got rid of my Anker 4 port data hub and just used usb to usb-c adapters for my usb keyboard, usb mouse and Anker usb ethernet adapter."
"I'm happy with this product. It allows me to use more usb-c on a desktop that just has type-a connectors. And I can download much faster than before."
"I purchased this adapter for my iPad Pro so that I could easily import drone photos and put them on an external drive. I had issues with the unit I received, and unfortunately I didn't test or discover them until the return window had closed.Anker stands by this product. When I described the issue to them, they offered to send a replacement, or issue me a refund. They were certain my unit was malfunctioning. Because I already found an alternative adapter, I took the refund, but nevertheless, anker is a great company with great customer service. You can purchase this adapter knowing that rest assured, in it doesn't work for you, anker will ensure your satisfaction nevertheless."
"I like that there is no extra power cord for when traveling.  I also like that it is flat and the ports are spaced out as that makes it easy to use security devices that can be a bit wider than just a cable."
"I tried another low cost hub to connect 3 ssd’s to my MacBook with no success. This hub connects 3 ssd’s with no problems. The secret is the pd port which is connected to a power supply. Even though labeled as pass through power to the Mac, this port apparently also supplies power to the ssd’s. Unplug the power, ssd’s disconnect. Plug in the power, ssd’s work consistently. Highly recommended."
"This Anker USB-C is good overall, but I had an issue where it doesn't work after waking from sleep in Windows 11. It's ""permanently"" connected to my desktop PC. My other card reader/hub does NOT have this issue, so it seems the Anker hub is to blame.The quick solution to fix this is to unplug and re-plug it in.The permanent fix is to adjust USB power settings in Windows. In Windows Search, type ""Control Panel"" and click on that result. In the Control Panel, click Hardware and Sound > Power Options > Change plan settings (for your current plan). Then click ""Change advanced power settings,"" ""USB Settings,"" and set the ""USB selective suspend setting"" to ""Disabled.""After making that change, it should work right away out of sleep."
"Ever felt like your laptop is playing hide and seek with all your devices? The Anker USB C Hub 341 has been my ultimate tech savior, transforming my MacBook Pro into a connectivity powerhouse! With seven ports, I can now connect everything from my 4K HDMI monitor to my trusty USB-A drives without juggling cables like a circus performer.The 100W Power Delivery is a game-changer, keeping my laptop charged even during marathon work sessions or intense gaming nights. The microSD and SD card readers are perfect for my photography hobby, allowing me to transfer photos at lightning speed. Plus, the sleek design fits seamlessly into my workspace, making it look as organized as a professional‚Äôs desk.However, I did notice that when all ports are in use, the hub can get a tad warm, but nothing that can‚Äôt be managed with a little ventilation. Also, while the setup is straightforward, it took me a few tries to figure out the optimal port arrangement for my needs.Overall, the Anker USB C Hub 341 is a must-have for anyone looking to expand their laptop‚Äôs capabilities. It‚Äôs versatile, reliable, and stylish, making my tech life so much easier. A solid 5-star rating for its performance and design, with a tiny star lost to its occasional warmth."
"This is a great adapter to have in your computer bag.  Works well to plug your computer into almost anything.  Works perfect."
"I purchased this HUB to use with my SteamDeck, it has worked perfectly.  I use it for when I travel and love how compact it is.  I used it along with the SteamDeck's power supply, a very skinny 12 ft HDMI cable, and a 6 FT USB-C extension to the SteamDeck so I can use the SteamDeck as the controller. I like using the SteamDeck as a controller because I use Steam controls (back triggers and trackpads shortcuts).  Sometimes I have needed a power extension cord, but that has more to do with the layout of the rooms I have used it.  It also works with my old Samsung Note 8 to get DEX on any screen.  I would like to let you know if it works with a computer, but I need to upgrade to one with USB-C ports... planning to get one soon.For what I'm using this HUB, it has way more ports than I need, but it's never bad to have extra ports if the price is acceptable. Also, the price for this was way less than the official SteamDeck dock and a good portion of the alternatives. Plus, since I prefer to use the SteamDeck as a controller, the other docks don't really work for me."
"Starting off with the Anker 7-in-1 USB C Hub, it's clear this little device is designed to offer a wide range of connectivity options in a sleek, compact design. With 4K HDMI output and 100W Power Delivery, this hub sets itself apart in a sea of adapters.The build quality is solid; it feels like it's made to last. I've purchased several of these hubs, mainly because they work great as Samsung DeX docks for my kids' phones, and they're handy to have in my bag for travel. One of the features I've found particularly useful is the SD Card slot ‚Äì it's a breeze transferring photos and videos between devices, be it my phone, camera, or laptop. I'm always on the go, and this hub simplifies that process immensely.However, there's one hiccup that I encountered. Although it boasts 100W Power Delivery, I've faced some challenges in finding a suitable power source to deliver that capacity to the hub, this was a problem with a MacBook Pro, HP Spectre 360 and a Dell XPS.  It's not a deal-breaker, but something to be mindful of if you're planning to use it more as a small ""dock"" instead of a portable travel hub.The Anker 7-in-1 USB C Hub offers fantastic value and versatility. It might have its quirks, but its positives certainly outweigh the negatives. I genuinely hope this review gives you some insights, and thanks for stopping by!"
"This works perfectly and lasts. The hub has all the connections I need to connect devices and power simultaneously with my iPad."
"I love Anker so much. They provide the best quality and fast charging. The adapter feels a bit light, giving the impression it is a bit cheap. However, the quality is great. I needed to project what was on my MacBook to quite a large TV and I didn‚Äôt notice any screen quality difference. If you are using sound for playing a video, make sure you connect the sound to the TV as well so it sinks up.1. Go to system settings2. Click on Displays3. Select your TV or Projector4. Select Mirror Your Screen if you want to see everything on your MacBookNote, it doesn‚Äôt work the other way around, you can‚Äôt receive input on MacBook like using an Xbox, Nintendo, PS5, etc. All the ports are exactly what you will ever need period. Cord length is just right too. I hate it when they give you this huge cord and you don‚Äôt know what do to with it. This also connects to iPhones if you have usb-c. Typically iPhone 15 or newer. This adapter is really great and I really recommend. If this doesn‚Äôt work for you, I would look at other Anker adapters or go Ugreen. Ugree has really good adapters too."
"Bought this to use with my MacBook. It allows me to hook up a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It seems to work fine. No complaints at this point."
"The UGREEN USB C HUB is a fantastic choice for anyone needing reliable, multi-functional connectivity. It‚Äôs compact, making it ideal for both travel and home office setups, and its versatility allows seamless integration across various devices. Featuring multiple ports, including USB-A, HDMI, SD card slots, and more, it offers everything needed to connect peripherals, transfer data, and expand screen real estate.Setup is hassle-free, with plug-and-play functionality that doesn‚Äôt require additional drivers.

Build quality feels sturdy, and the sleek design complements any setup.Overall, the UGREEN USB C HUB is perfect if you‚Äôre looking for a reliable, all-in-one solution that performs flawlessly."
"Purchased this to replace my old anker hub that died, decided to try out UGreen because it was well reviewed and it certainly did not disappoint.Pass through power works great with my 65w charger, connects to my laptop, phone, and my legion go all perfectly fine. Does get warm but never too hot to touch.The ports are exactly what I needed, usb A, hdmi, and an sd reader. There is an option above this that has ethernet as well but I did not need this for my setup.Works great with no issues across my device, size is compact and easy to carry, speeds are great with usb and sd cards.Value is certainly there, comes at a great price."
"Doesn't heat up as much as the other brand I bought in a store.  This gets a bit warm to the touch only. I feel better that this one can handle the transfers."

"This is a great addition to increase functionality. My laptop has only one USB-A type port. I like to use a trackball mouse and full size keyboard. The printer cable needs someplace to insert too. This addition allows me to use all 3 because I used USB adaptors. At the price it is a bargain. I still have HDMI and card reader ports available."
"The speed and ports are amazing. Only downside is drains batter little faster and heats up quickly."
"I have this for my macbook pro m1 and they work fantastically. Ironically, I ended up having to use this for the first time to try and retrieve dashcam footage after a crash (turns out I didn't have my dashcam pointing at the right place) but it works as intended, is just a little bulky. For the price, it's pretty hard to beat, and can plug your accessories and storage devices in as intended. Recommend as a buy, especially if it goes on sale for $16 or even less."
"Bought to use for transferring camera cards to SSD so I don't have to bring my laptop for travel jobs. I shoot 4K video on Lumix S5 and S1, and this is an absolute breeze to transfer files using the iPad as an intermediate device. I can connect my card reader, iPad, and USB-C charger to this hub all at the same time."
"The UGREEN USB C Hub 7-in-1 is a versatile and efficient addition to my tech setup.

"I’m not the most tech savvy and wanted backup on an external drive for graphics heavy work and photos.  I remember the challenge of making my last external drive compatible and especially deleting old files, so I was a little anxious trying to find a solution.In case it helps someone else, I work primarily on an iPad Pro in a design program (Affinity) and needed a backup storage solution besides the Cloud.  I didn’t really want a second cloud solution to be backup and can’t use an external drive with the iPad.  I also have a MacBook, which has massive storage, but can’t be backed up to ICloud, while the ipad can backup to iCloud.  My workaround for immediate file saving is to create shared files which are stored on iCloud (I call them Desktop) on the ipad.  Desktop is stored on the hard drive of the MacBook and gets updated via ICloud device sharing even though I can’t initiate an iCloud backup from the MacBook.Inside Desktop I have labeled files as usual and a parent file for graphic design from the Ipad, broken down into 100+ named project files and sub files.  Whenever I save from the ipad, I save to Desktop (in iCloud) and then choose the appropriate file within Desktop to save.  This way I have the folders on the hard drive of the MacBook as interim backup, and am working around not having iCloud backup storage available when I’m on the MacBook.  The T7 comes in as secure and portable physical data storage.The T7 drive is the hard copy backup of the files shared between the iPad and MacBook, I think necessary in case of some dreadful software issue, fire, or other unanticipated loss of access.  I plan to have more than one as soon as I can afford it, to rotate.Again hopefully this may help someone like me who spent some solid hours figuring out a better way to secure my data and workaround the Mac user experience.Since I am wanted to do manual backups I needed the process to be easy so I wouldn’t avoid doing them, for obvious reasons.  Though we don’t need to get into it here I don’t want to use Time Machine on my Mac to back up the disk.  So I had to figure out something else.The T7 is great, easy to use, no time at all to install, self explanatory pretty much.  I dragged folders full of work from the desktop (yes I like to see them, don’t judge) to backup.  The initial backup was very quick and painless, most files were a few seconds.  The graphics heavy files perhaps took about 10 minutes?  These are massive, not a problem, and may have been quicker than this, I expected it to take more time.  (My last iCloud backup was over 13 hours of anxiety - I kid you not and have since deleted almost all the working files from the drawing app after saving them in Desktop so they happen more quickly now, but still, I thought this was a daylong project). I experimented with dragging an old file to the trash from the T7 disk pane, and it worked as expected.  I had to read online about how to go about copying my photos library (Mac) to disk, but it wasn’t hard.  I have over 40,000 images, and it took about 20 minutes as I recall, if longer probably max 25.  I tested the backup by remaining in the open pane and opening the photo files, which worked.  Amazingly all this data barely touches the capacity of the drive, maybe 10% or less of a TB?  Minuscule, anyway.  2 TB is overkill for me, especially since old files can easily be deleted.(This may be different for a user in Time Machine because it keeps multiple versions of your backups, and maybe more settings etc. which can take up a lot of space?-  not tech savvy, as I said, but I had trouble with my older system and Time Machine and being unable to delete backups which rendered my backup disk unusable, and I didn’t want to deal with this again even though it’s less convenient to do it manually).I think the T7 drive will fail before I need more space, which is a great problem to have.  I’m planning to get another disk (with less storage) and use it as a failsafe backup- ideally storing it in a safe or out of the house just in case, and keeping a rotation to protect against loss.On the critical end, I’d love it and think it would be much safer for data if the user pane of the T7 was visibly different from the one on my desktop.  It’s the same color, font, everything, as my desktop window (maybe that’s just how these things work?), which makes me triple check when I’m deleting or updating.  Don’t do this on a Friday night after an adult beverage….I’d also love it if there was a simple tutorial available when you opened the disk up, just for ease of first use, a how to  (experimented with a throwaway file deleting because it wasn’t obvious that dragging files to the trash would work) for most, and as a reminder for others.  I hesitate getting one for my parents because of this.  But I’m happy and will buy another, looking forward to the peace of mind it gives me."
"Great, quick upload and read speeds. Very small, comes with wires for both USB types, and tons of storage for a super cheap price."
"The Samsung T7 500GB Portable SSD in Grey is an absolute powerhouse, earning a solid five stars from me. Its lightning-fast speeds of up to 1050MB/s make transferring files a breeze, whether you're a student, professional, or avid gamer. Personally, I use it to store virtual machines, and let me tell you, it handles the task with ease. The sleek design and compact size make it highly portable, perfect for on-the-go use. Overall, if you're in need of speed, reliability, and ample storage capacity, this product is an excellent choice that won't disappoint."
"I got these to go into a couple of old, struggling laptops that I am using for Linux. I ended up using a USB SATA adapter to play around... and wow! They blew away my USB flash drives. I did put them in the laptops and they fit, work well and are faster than my old SATA SSDs. The 1TB is more than plenty for playing with Linux. The cost is very reasonable and they work well."
"Installed in an Acer Nitro 5 laptop as D drive for storage.  Excellent ssd, fast and easy install.  Highly recommended 👌"
"Worked perfect. I used two to add as cache drives in a mirrored setup. Easy setup and they are fast enough for this purpose. My only complaint as with all of the drives on the market...would it kill them to include screws?? Either way I would buy again."
"I bought this drive to replace a very old HDD which had all of my music, photos and documents as a secondary drive on my computer.  I was going to get a Samsung, which is the brand I use for my primary drive, but it was significantly more expensive than this drive for the same size.  The comparable Samsung SSD is a bit faster, but for my secondary drive the difference in price made this a no-brainer for the large 2 Tb size.  Works just fine for my purpose and plenty fast enough compared to my old spinning hard drive."
"Cost effective and from a trusted and reliable American brand. Micron is  a great company and though this is one of their lower end products I have no doubts it will last a long time.Performance is good but since this unit lacks DRAM it isn’t quite as fast as many of the higher end models but this is good basic drive"
"Easy to clone old drive over to new SSD with free Acronis software you get online. Did have to get a SSD to usb cable to make the transfer happen.  Copying took about an hour to do. Once completed shut everything down opened up back of laptop. Mine had a removable panel over the hard drive and memory which made this pretty easy. Take out Two screws and gently pop the lid off. Old drive was right there.  Remove a couple of screws,  pulled old drive out. Had to remove the frame around old drive to install on new SSD.  Did this then mounted new SSD in frame put screws back for that then put the lid back on. This snaps in. You have to push pretty hard on some areas to get it to click in. Don’t forget the two screws that go with the lid.  My laptop was a Dell Inspiron with AMD 4 core processor and 8 gigs of memory.  Used to take forever to boot up and chrome felt like it would never open. Now this is not an issue anymore. Boots up fast and chrome almost pops right up when clicked on.  I think this is good investment to revive an old laptop to get more years out of it. Oh also upgraded OS to Win 11 although it was compatible. This seems to be working good as well. You can find videos on how to upgrade non compatible systems to windows 11 on you tube."
"This Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD is fantastic. I had a smaller Crucial external SSD that I used to store pictures and files, but I recently purchased a mini computer to travel with and wanted to increase the storage space and have 2 drives instead of just 1, so I purchased this product.  It was very easy to install (it just hooked right in once I removed the cover), and I was able to image my laptop easily using the EaseUS software and a SATA to USB cable adapter. It was the first time I ever tried doing anything like that and it worked perfectly. I have had had no issues with the new computer finding the drive, or moving things to or from it.  Everything that was copied onto it worked perfectly once I booted up the system. It doesn't get hot and the majority of the storage was available.  My other Crucial products have lasted for years so I'm hoping the same can be said for this.  If I encounter any issues later on I will update this review."
"A Timely Upgrade from Traditional Hard Drives:The Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA SSD is a stellar choice for those looking to upgrade from older SSDs or move away from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). As a user who has experienced the disappointment of a HDD failure, the switch to this SSD was not just an upgrade, but a necessity.Rapid Performance and Vast Storage:One of the most noticeable improvements is the boot time.

The peace of mind that comes from using a more reliable and efficient storage solution is invaluable, especially for those who have endured the frustration of HDD failures."
"The product arrived well packed and protected in its box.The installation was supposed to be quick, but since it comes with a built-in heatsink, I had to remove the one that comes by default with the Gigabyte Z790M AX ICE motherboard and I was missing the screw to secure it. So, you know, get one.I just installed it as the main operating system disk in the slot closest to the processor and it works very well. I recommend downloading the Samsung Magician program to control the LED light and monitor it.I also took the opportunity to do some reading and writing tests and I think they are within expectations.So far, this product is going very well for me. I recommend it."
"The Samsung 990 Pro with Heatsink is a game-changer. As a demanding PC user, I needed a drive that could keep up with my intense workloads, and this SSD delivers.Pros: * Lightning-Fast Speeds: The read and write speeds are absolutely insane. Boot times are nearly instantaneous, and large file transfers are a breeze. * Robust Performance: The included heatsink ensures optimal performance, even under heavy load. No more worrying about thermal throttling. * Sleek Design: The sleek design and RGB lighting add a touch of style to my build. * Reliable Storage: Samsung's reputation for quality and reliability is well-deserved. I have complete confidence in this drive.Cons: * Pricey: While it's a premium product, the performance justifies the cost for serious users.If you're looking for the best performance and reliability, the Samsung 990 Pro with Heatsink is the way to go. It's a worthy investment that will future-proof your PC."
"23 June 20241) SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen4 MZ-V9P2T0B/AMSold by: Amazon.com Services, Inc $169.992) Thermalright HR09 2280 PROSold by: Thermalright Direct $8.993) Noctua NF-A6x25Sold by: Noctua Cooling Solutions $14.95TLDR: Good M.2I decided to go ahead and put a heatsink on this. Heat has been, is and shall always be the #1 enemy to electronics. Unfortunately, heat dissipation engineering is often underrated, overlooked and badly done, if done at all. With this setup, it never gets above 30c during Samsung Magician performance test. Base mobo temp is 29C.Before attaching the HR09 I removed the sticker form the M.2, the silicone pad from the HR09 and applied Prolimatech PK-3 to the HR09. The picture shows TF-7 but I found that stuff way too thick and didn’t spread well. I used Acetone and q-tips to get the sticker gum off the chip tops. The bottom of the HR09 is steel and really needs to be aluminum but the chips are on top of the M.2 so that is where the most heat can be dissipated. I then attached an NF-A6x25 to the HR09 using some nickel wire. I also needed to augment the foam pad between the M.2 and the mobo. Without doing these mods, it was as if the HR09 wasn't there.My tried and true method of applying heatsink paste that works perfect every single time, no fuss, no worry, and gives visible indication it worked and that the paste isn't old dried out beyond it's shelf life: Every heatsink is always a mm or two wider than the object it is sinking. Simply run tape down the sides a mm or two in from the sides and spread paste on with a single edged razor blade. The narrow thin tape on the edges act like runners for the razor blade to skate on. Hold blade at an angle, it isn't critical, between 10 and 60 degrees doesnt matter. Then peel the tape off. Apparently I didn't take a picture of the HR09 when I did that so I am including a picture of the CPU heatsink done in the exact same manner to give you the idea. They really should include some narrow, thin cellophane tape and a single sided razor blade instead of a uselss spatula.Great drive for a reasonable price. Very fast."
"I recently installed the SAMSUNG 990 PRO Heatsink SSD 4TB in my gaming machine, and I’m blown away by the performance. The installation was straightforward, and the heatsink is a nice touch – it keeps the drive cool during long gaming sessions. As for speed, this thing is insanely quick. Load times in games are almost non-existent, and transferring large files is a breeze.The 4TB storage is more than enough for all my games, videos, and other files. I noticed a big boost in overall system performance, from faster boot times to smoother gameplay. If you're looking for a high-performance SSD that’s built to handle gaming demands, the SAMSUNG 990 PRO is a great choice. Definitely worth the investment!"
"Easy and fast to install and transfers data even faster.  Great quality and value for the money. Designed to fit into small spaces and no noise. Very good quality."
"For those of you that were wondering if you can use this with your XBOX Series X/S - YOU CAN!  I put this in a SABRENT Rocket RGB USB C 20Gbps M.2 SATA/NVMe SSD Enclosure (EC-RGBG).  Two things that you need to be aware of.  First, you need to use your computer/Laptop to allocate/initialize this hard drive (under Computer Management/Disk Management) and then you can format as NTFS.  Second, since my XBOX does not have a USB C input for external hard drives you cannot use the cable that comes with the Sabrent above (USB C to USB C), you will need to use a quality high speed USB A to USB C cable (3.1 Gen 2 capable of 7500Mbs or higher).  After doing all of this, you can then connect to your XBOX and it will recognize it as an external hard drive and prompt you to format it for XBOX.  One final thing is that if you are writing a lot of files to this, it will get hot which may cause the transfer rate to slow down.  Just don't forget to remove the plastic protective film over the built-in thermal padding for heat dissipation in your Sabrent enclosure before putting it back together.  Since this does get hot on the exterior with use, the aluminum body must be doing its job to dissipate the internal heat!"
"Amazing and fast can't get any better and the software from samsung monitoring is easy and simple"
"These SSDs are fast and are always cheaper than the non-heatsink versions. I am happy with performance and qualityI have 1 TB 980 version and 2 TB 990 version. Very easy to install and set up"

"SanDisk 2TB Portable SSDThis is a nice little external hard drive. Read and Write Speed is very fast, which is great for downloading my wildlife photos quickly. I will regularly come back with 20+ gigabytes of photos from a single day shooting action shots in burst, and it only takes around 10-15 minutes to transfer onto the drive, where I can begin to purge my photos in lightroom. It is extremely compact, and able to easily fit in your pocket. The casing feels durable.

Whether you're upgrading an old system or looking for additional storage, I highly recommend the SP A55 SSD. It’s reliable, fast, and gives a noticeable boost in performance!"
"1TB for under $50 is a fair price for such a decently spec’d SATA SSD. I used this drive in my user upgradable MacBook Pro with very solid results. It installed without a hiccup and formatted without issues. It is a noticeable improvement over the standard rotating storage included as standard. I don’t know how long this drive will last but I have purchased other SSD’s from the same brand and they are still going strong 4-years and 7-years later. That doesn’t always translate into like performance and/or longevity but based on my previous experiences with this brand and the price of the drive I wasn’t concerned. Fast with plenty of storage space available at a relative bargain."
"Performance was as advertised."
"I bought this Silicon Power solid state hard drive to use in an old HP TouchSmart 600 all-in-one that I bought back in 2011. The short story is that I was able to get it work. However, it was not a straightforward as will other brands.As I mentioned, I bought this computer in 2011. It had Windows 7 on it. In 2021, the hard drive was about to die, so I replaced it with a modern solid state hard drive (Samsung brand). Because the newer drives are smaller than the one that came with the computer, I used a 2.5"" to 3.5"" caddy to hold it. I installed Windows 10. I just followed the install wizard and everything went smoothly.Last week, the power went out and my computer wouldn't boot up. Everything (including the hard drive) passed the checks, but it was super, super slow. I tried to run restores from USB and DVD. They would kind of run, but so so slow, I was unable to troubleshoot. I also tried to install Windows again, but it failed each time. I decided to buy the same Samsung HDD thinking it would be cheaper now (3 years later) but it was actually $10 more. There was a suggestion for the Silicon Power brand (same size and everything) and it was half the price. I have 5 or 6 USB sticks from Silicon Power and I like them, so I bought this one instead.It was just as easy to install into the computer, but the Windows installation did not work. The wizard would not allow me to choose any partition. They were all GPT (and needed to be MBR). I googled and read about some fixes and then watched a couple videos. Basically I had to pull up the command prompt (shift F10) then enter disk partition mode (diskpart), list, then select the disk, clean it, and then convert to mbr. Once this was done, then I refreshed the wizard and it allowed me to choose a partition. And then Windows 10 installed without an issue.I did not have to do any of this when installing Windows 10 on the Samsung hard drive (same computer) three years ago. The issue for this Silicon Power hard drive is that it came as GPT (not MBR) and it was already partitioned (4 partitions). I don't know if this is how all of them come. Maybe this was a used hard drive, returned, and then resold (without reformatting it). I am not sure. But it seems odd that it would come with 4 partitions.The drive is working fine. I am typing this on that computer right now. So  I would give the hard drive 5 stars, if not for the way it came (which required extra time to research and stuff). I believe that could be an issue for many people.note: I wrote this review a long time ago, but it appear I never clicked the submit button, so submitting it now."
"Put these in two older laptops a Toshiba P775 and a DEll Inspiron 7720 both are going on 13yrs old they needed updated to Windows 10. Windows 7 and 8 are in the history books. No more support. Good laptops to do this upgrade with. These SSD drives are very good for this purpose to get more life out them. I did notice a couple of good things after install both laptops run much cooler over the older HDD drives. The overall performance of the laptops was a 100% better for both. I'm holding off for now on  getting new laptops that would well you know cost a lot more than two ssd drives. Will update if anything changes in the future. Also I want thank SP for the great product can't forget about that!!!"
"Worked as it should and the speed is also fine."
"These are not a well known brand, nor are they the most or least expensive. Many years ago I began testing different SSD's to find some balance between the high end expensive drives and the cheaper less well known products. I do custom builds, repairs and computer upgrades for friends, neighbors and people in my church, so cost and reliability are both factors. A few people don't have tight budgets, so I run with Crucial, Intel or Western Digital drives. But most of the people I do this for are very budget conscious and I needed something i could support and they could afford. Out of 8 different less expensive drives, the SP drive has provided the value, speed and most of all, the reliability I need. With the newer m2 drives I really love, there is still a use for these 2.5"" SP SSD's for older upgrades."
"All is ok"
"Have had this for a few years now working very hard & is still working well would buy this again"
"This mouse is replacing an older wired mouse that I really liked, but after two of those old ones failed within a year, I figured I'd pull the trigger on this one.  I was not disappointed.  It feels good in the hand, has a great DPI adjustment, and ALL the buttons are programmable (including the stock DPI settings button by the scroll wheel).  The included weight disk to put in the bottom is a nice feature, too.  I like a heavier mouse.I leave the ""bling"" (the RGB lights) turned off to extend battery life between charges, and it lasts me days without getting low doing it that way.  If you MUST have the RGB switched on, it will drain the battery faster, but it comes with a handy charger/dongle adapter which you could even use as a wired mouse if you really wanted to.  All in all, one of the better mice Logitech has made in recent years."
"I originally purchased a G305 Mouse.  It replaces the Microsoft 4000 mouse that I had been purchasing for years.  The G305 had a bad dongle, so I purchased the G703 as a replacement.The G703 is a great mouse.  I like where the charging port it and the guides it uses to secure the cable to the mouse.  So far I have been charging it once a week and have never run out of battery power.  If you download the G Hub app, it will let you know the battery level and charging progress.  It's pretty much required if you like a higher sensitivity for your mouse setting.The one beef....  Logitech... could you have a socket for the dongle to be placed in.  I travel a lot and take it with me.  I am always worried about loosing the dongle."
"UPDTAE: JAN 6, 2022. ive had this mouse for a month now and till now I have 0 double clicking issues. I use a double click detector on google site, everyday since I've got this mouse I test 200 clicks on left and right click. I get 0 double clicks error.Also the logitech software on PC has been updated and I have 0 issues with it as mentioned on some of the reviews on here. Also the range and disconnecting issue I have not encountered them ( PRO TIP: USE the cable extension that it came with as this acts as an antenna extender and place the USB dongle away from your PC, metal, or any electronics that can cause interference. Also make sure to separate from other wireless dongles IE: Logitech G915 Wreless).As for its size and ergonomics, it is very comfortable to use.  I have very small hands and it's comfortable for me. It's works great for palm gripper of ypu have small hands.Old review:I was very skeptical about purchasing this but It's been 3 weeks and NO double click issue that people are reporting on other reviews. Very light and premium build. It uses the same Hero sensor as the more expensive G pro  for a lot cheaper price. It's ergonomic and it's perfect for palm grip. Other grip style works well IF YOU HAVE BIG HANDS. For smaller hands palm grip works well. RGB is nice without over doing it. The material they use are premium and there is rubber pad grips on the sides to help slippage. The left/right and side button clicks are one of the best feeling in the market. The wheel scroll is also very good. Unfortunately there is no infinite scroll but it's NOT deal breaker what so ever. ONE of the best gaming mouse I've used and it's very sleek looking. Other gaming mouse looks over done with a transformer look to it, which I hate. Lots of good review on YT"
"This is a review for the Logitech G703 wireless mouse. I have had two in a three year time span.I am generally a fan of this mouse.I won't speak to the shape of it too much because that is very subjective per each individual. I will note, though this may be obvious, that the G703 is definitely designed to be a right-handed mouse. I personally find it ergonomic to use - I am right-handed, hand size is 10cm wide by 17cm long, and use this mouse mostly in a claw grip.The long-standing gripe with the G703 is that the scroll wheel tends to flake out, and my first purchase of the G703 was no exception to this. For me, the scroll wheel issues started to occur three years after purchase. The issue is that the scroll wheel would sort of chatter and spaz out on screen - the physical scroll wheel works fine mechanically, but the scroll wheel input is wildly inconsistent. For example, if you scroll down the same exact way three times, you may scroll down normally on the PC the first time, then the second time it actually scrolls up (even though you physically scrolled down) and the third time it will scroll down but at a very different rate than before.I worked with customer service to diagnose the issue and they could not find a mechanical problem. I eventually took the mouse apart and can confirm that there is no mechanically broken component or debris in the mouse to cause this at a mechanical level - there is likely something wrong with the actual electric or software components of the mouse.Other than that one big, glaring issue, I really like this mouse! I use it mostly for office work and internet browsing, though I have also used it for gaming. I am not a pro FPS player and cannot comment on the super fine details like latency and pixel/DPS accuracy, but I use this mostly on wireless and see 0 issues on my end."
"This is, in my opinion, the most ergonomic mouse that there is. I've used the full lineup of the g series mice and this one takes the cake. Only complaint is the bulkier side buttons, just like the 903. I would prefer them to be more like the g-pro or the 305. I don't mind the side buttons, I just know they could be better. Even with that minor setback, the way this mouse feels in my hand is nothing short of amazing. Buttons are all super satifying and responsive. I will absolutely be buying this product again. I would say this is my forever mouse."
"My favorite mouse by miles. Went from a Mamba Elite to this and will never go back! Great performance and battery life, comes with an extra weight too if you prefer a little heavier feel. All in all it's an incredible mouse and I love it!"
"I recently upgraded to the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed Wireless Optical Mouse, after having the same $15.00 mouse for over 7 years. and I’m thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Its lightweight, has a long battery life, ability to change DPI on the fly, and simply looks clean.Performance:The LIGHTSPEED wireless technology is a game-changer. I’ve experienced zero lag or connectivity issues, which is crucial for any game, rather it be Stardew Valley, or high precision requirements such as CS2. The HERO 25K sensor is incredibly accurate, offering pinpoint precision that has noticeably improved my in-game performance. The adjustable DPI settings are a huge plus, allowing me to switch between high and low sensitivity effortlessly.Features:The mouse has 13 customizable controls for you to assign shortcuts/hotkeys too for MMORPG gaming, or MOBA gaming. Changing these hotkeys is simply one program away, downloadable on the Logitech Website. Use of this application also allows the user to change the RGB patterning that is displayed along the mouse. The G502X does also feature the ability to use PowerPlay and charge your mouse, wirelessly, with an additional purchase of course.Cons:With anything the cost can be pretty high for this peripheral, especially if you purchase the additional PowerPlay ability, this Mouse + Pad could be fairly expensive.Overall, after 1 month I am highly satisfied with my purchase, the mouse is just so comfortable to use for 8+ hours of desk work, or gaming activities."
"Easy to connect and use right away. The battery life is incredible, so you don't have to worry about running out unless you forget to charge it multiple nights in a row. Though its slightly heavy, the pads on the bottom are very nice, so it glides across mousepads easily, and feels agile. The buttons feel nice, and the RGB is good. The only issue is that the Logitech Hub app is somewhat unreliable, but otherwise the mouse is excellent."
"I've been a long time user of the G602 and G604, but both were heavy, and the 604 replaced the 602, and has since been discontinued and not replaced.  So after searching for mice with extra buttons near the thumb but also comfortable with a lot of the features I've loved in the 604.  While the G502 X didn't fill all those needs, it's been a great choice.Pros:- Ergonomic - It just fits my (rather large) hand well in a few different positions, and is so light I've found my wrist fatigue has been reduced significantly. Unlike the 604, I can press every button easily without looking for them, particularly the scroll wheel, DPI adjustments, and 3 easy to find thumb buttons is great. It also feels comfortable, which is hard to describe, but the material feel is what I want in a mouse.- Light - I mentioned this in the ergonomic part, but its super light.  Apparently it's around 105 grams, which can be heavy for an ultra-competitive mouse, but for most gamers or folks just looking for a light wireless mouse, it's great.- Great button feel - The older Logitech mice used to have a weird mushy click and my old 602 and 604 both had issues where the button would stop working well.  The new G502 X models have a new mechanical click that feels amazing. Very much like a mechanical keyboard as far as consistancy and feedback.  Not every button has the same feel, but they all feel very tactile and reliable.- Great battery life - I can get 3 weeks on a full charge at 1000 hz poling rate.  Don't bother with smaller polling rates, as when the mouse isn't being used it's not a power issue, and when it is in use, it's still not a huge power issue.  You might get a few extra days at best, but if 3 weeks isn't enough charge time for you, I'd be shocked.- USB-C charging - Sad that this is still a plus, but USB-C cables are so much better.  Glad we're finally starting to no longer see Micro-USB cables.- Works Wired  - Forgot to charge it?  You can use it wired, or use it while charging (Either works).- Great sensitivity - The mouse is so adjustable, I found I could turn it down from my usual DPI and get both great responsiveness and accuracy with a near default config.- Customizable - Logitech G software has flaws, but it does allow some pretty good versatile configurations. Every button can be remapped and remapping can be done on a per-app basis.- Logitech Support - I've had multiple issues with Logitech mice long into their service but under warranty, and Logitech has always been easy to work with to get a replacement or help.  This sounds like I'm saying Logitech has a quality issue, and I'm not, I know stuff happens, particularly with high use products, so it's good they stand by them.Cons:- Large - It's not a small mouse, so if you have small hands, it could be a little large for you.  It also means it's not easily portable, though honestly mice aren't that large in general, so portability isn't a major concern, and you can always get a mouse case if you travel a lot and want to protect it.- Logitech G Software sucks - I mean, it does OK, it can auto-sense games, you can copy profiles, but it has several general flaws, including if it detects a new game it generates that game's default setting that you CAN NOT CUSTOMIZE ahead of time.  If I have a known default mapping/DPI setting I know I like in most games, why can't I make that the default? Also, making button changes and navigation of the US is very unintuitive.  Like one of the worst UIs I've worked with on a major brand's software.  It also by default likes to spam notifications that is harder to turn off than I would have liked (Otherwise, every time the mouse gets touched, you get a windows notification or 3 about the mouse and DPI changes).  Their old software (pre 2015) was easy to use, and worked in the UI was nearly the exact opposite of this.  Fix your software Logitech!- No backup gliders - Not a deal breaker, as I know I've not had a mouse with glider issues in the past 10-15 years, but it would be nice, particularly on a gaming mouse where if the pads wear it could be noticeable for some. I don't need stickers Logitech, I'd rather have a replacement pad set.- No pinkie rest - Some mice have a nice pinkie rest that helps you relax your hand a bit.  This mouse does not. That's definitely a personal thing, and honestly most gaming mice have moved away from this due to weight, but with a large hand, I like mice with them.Overall, it's a great mouse with a lot going for it. I'm enjoying using it, have found my hand/arm feel better after a day of using it vs my old mouse, and love all the features it offers that I can look past any small shortcomings.Who do I recommend this mouse for?  Artists who need finite DPI control.  Office workers who want a bigger mouse (there are cheaper options, but it's a solid productivity mouse).  People who use their computer for a significant time.  Casual gamers. Competitive gamers who want an all in one mouse.  It's a good mouse for a lot of use cases, which is why I'm giving it a 5 star review.  It's not perfect, but very few products are, and it's strong where it needs to be."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



they get what you pay for scenario, and you get a lot for your money with this bad boy. It is feature packed I could go on forever talking about it, but you can find all those features listed elsewhere. Ergonomically is very comfortable to use for long periods of time and has excellent battery life in real world usage As well as being fully programmable/customizable.  I've had some pretty high-end mouses in my day from Razor and other companies and not much if anything can out compete this, if so it's by such a slim margin you would never notice. The coolness factor is off the charts as that's the first thing people notice in my entire set up full of the coolest gadgets like a Divoom Time Gate and stuff like that everywhere so much that my media room/man cave Is a tech gadget Wonderland of tasteful items and almost 20 sets of Almost everything Govee lighting has to offer to top it off.  just keep an eye out for sale as it's obviously not the most affordable mouse on the market, but nobody ever regrets purchasing the best quality product, you'll never sit there months later thinking, boy I wished I had a lower quality mouse, as you will forget about the price pretty quickly, but you will be stuck with whatever most you buy, So depending on the application get the right mouse for the job so you have no regrets.."
"Have been using Uhuru mice for almost 4 years now.  Typically have to replace them annually, and have had to utilize the warranty a few times.  Replacing the mouse by warranty, if defective, is not an issue.  Customer service is prompt and ships a new mouse out free of charge.  As for life span, most gaming mice I've trialed typically don't last more than a year, so that isn't an issue.  The mouse has multiple DPI settings that can be preprogrammed, is comfortable for hours of continued use, has sensitive click buttons, and is pleasant to look at.  As for cons, there is only one DPI button that has to be used to cycle through all settings, rather than the WM-07 that had a forward and backward button.  Also don't advise packing the mouse for travel frequently if you need something for the office and at home, as the components tend to be a bit fragile.  However, with the mouse being cost effective, it wouldn't be difficult to keep one at the office and one at home.  Overall, I have no desire to stray from the brand and plan to remain a Uhuru customer for the foreseeable future."
"I chose this mouse because of its unique appearance. I love that it changes colors and has a fun and sleek design. It's responsive, colorful and I really enjoy it so far."
"Update:So, after my first review, I was contacted by the seller and they offered to send me a new mouse because they determined the lagging could be due to a sensor issue. Their customer service was top-notch and surprising because no other seller has contacted me to give their product a second chance. This mouse also has a 12-month warranty which I didn't know about.I'm really glad that I gave this mouse another shot! There is no lagging issue like the last one had. The previous mouse started lagging on the first day but I have been testing this mouse out for a few days now and there has been no sign of it.The battery life has lasted me a little over 24 hours. The scrolling wheel is smoother than the last one I had and it doesn't feel as cheaply made, like I can crush it in my hand. It actually feels like I got a completely different mouse than the one I purchased.All in all, I'm liking it so far.Original Review:The UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse has several issues that make it a difficult product to recommend. First and foremost, it has serious lagging issues that make it frustrating to use. It can be unresponsive and sluggish, which can be a significant problem for gamers who need precision and quick reflexes.The build quality of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse feels cheap and flimsy. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up over time, and it could easily break if not handled delicately. The buttons and scroll wheel don't have a satisfying tactile feel, which further contributes to the impression of a low-quality product.The battery life of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse is subpar, lasting only 3-4 hours on a single charge. This means that you'll need to keep it plugged in frequently, which can be inconvenient and frustrating.Despite these issues, it's worth noting that the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse does have one positive aspect: the changing colors are beautiful. If you prioritize aesthetics and want a mouse that looks good, then this mouse is for you.Overall, while the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse may look nice, it falls short in several important areas and may not be the best choice for most users. If you're in the market for a gaming mouse, there are better options available that provide better performance, build quality, and battery life."
"Mouse linked and worked well right away. Smooth, light and has some great button options on it especially for gaming. The battery doesn’t last real long but for a cheap rechargeable item that’s expected. Takes an old style charger that you don’t get a cord for, so hopefully you have one in the junk drawer or somewhere. Overall it’s great for the price."
"Third review:This is my third review of this mouse in six years. I am now on my fourth UHURU gaming mouse, with an order placed for a fifth as a backup. Like clockwork, these mice seem to last just over two years for me, with heavy every day use (12+ hours per day). This time, my third UHURU gaming mouse had one of the side buttons cave in, similar to my first one. I again could not be happier with my experience. For $20, you're getting an incredibly durable wireless mouse that has a very smooth feel, fits perfectly in the hand for someone with average or above average hand sizes, and looks amazing with that LED lighting and matte black casing.I can't give enough praise to UHURU for this mouse. Unless something drastically changes, I don't see myself ever using a different mouse at any point in the future. I don't think I've ever had this consistently positive of an experience with any other product on Amazon, this mouse is seriously incredible. I will be sure to come back in another two years with an update after I use my fourth UHURU gaming mouse to death.Second review:I reviewed this mouse two years ago, and had purchased it again to replace the original one I had because after two years of extensive use it finally had enough. Couldn’t have been happier with it. The replacement one I received also lasted two years for me, with extensive every day heavy gaming use. I literally use it actively for 12 hours a day or so, every day. Everything I do in life is from my computer, and this mouse has weathered that storm for two years on two separate occasions now. Last time one of the thumb buttons finally had caved in, this time it’s just slowly dying, randomly turning off while plugged in. Again, couldn’t be happier with how long it has lasted and how much it has endured. I cannot recommend this mouse enough for anyone out there, regardless of your situation. I have now ordered another one, and will update again in another two years!First review:This mouse is amazing, regardless of the price, but the price just makes it that much better. I purchased this mouse in January of 2018 and today, in April of 2020, it finally had its first problem. One of the side/thumb buttons caved in, basically, which is the result of heavy use over a long period of time. I have already placed an order for a new one, and my girlfriend is excited to use my old one since she doesn't use the side buttons and it still functions perfectly otherwise.It's hard for me to find wireless and comfortable gaming mice that have acceptable performance, but this one had it all. I can't tell the difference in delay between this wireless mouse and other wired mice. On top of it, it's very comfortable. I have a slightly above average hand size and with most mice it's hard for me to find a comfortable way to grip it and use it, but this mouse is the perfect size and I'm not having to stretch my fingers to reach any of the buttons, they're all in the perfect place. It's very responsive to movement, and unlike other wireless mice when it goes into power-save mode and you have to click to wake it up, it doesn't send a ""click"" command to the computer, so if it went into power-save mode while the cursor was over a button, it wouldn't click the button when I wake up the mouse, which brings me to its incredible battery life and charging speed. I thought for sure with the LED lights and low price the battery wouldn't last very long, but it lasts me multiple days on one charge before I need to recharge it. Then, when I need to charge it, I just plug it into my computer and it becomes a wired mouse for about 20 minutes and then it'll last me a couple more days with heavy use.The bottom line is that if you're looking for a great wireless gaming mouse at an affordable price, stop looking, you've found it. There's no reason not to get this mouse if you're a gamer. If you're not a gamer, there's probably cheaper mice out there that'll do what you need it to, but for gamers this is the perfect wireless mouse."
"It came with the mouse, a charger and a chip. The battery lasts about a couple hours (3-4). works well and clicky mouse. The cable is quite long and it takes about 30 minutes to charge from 0% battery to 100% battery. fits nicely on my hand and comfortable. I would recommend this mouse."
"Great price. Fast shipping. The product works as intended, only problem is the battery doesn't last long but it's rechargeable so it doesn't matter"
"I’m really happy with this webcam. I use it for Zoom work meetings, and it’s been fantastic. The picture quality is sharp and clear, and the microphone picks up my voice well, so I never have to worry about audio issues. Setup was a breeze—just plug it in, and you’re good to go. I also appreciate the added privacy cover. It’s a great value for a reliable webcam."
"My laptop camera all the sudden was not working correctly and became very blurry so I purchased this webcam. It is easy to use and install and works great (better than my laptop camera)."
"This is an affordable, high-functioning little camera. The picture is very clear, sound quality excellent. The best feature of this camera is the adjustable viewing square that allows the user to zoom in or out to create the meeting room that is best for the call or video. This is a rare find at this price point! My only complaint is that the camera does not stay on my laptop as securely as I'd like. It has fallen off during meetings at just a little nudge of the desk. Wish the mounting brace had padding on it to make a more snug fit."
"Have had this for a few months and it still works great. Pretty solid 1080p picture quality for such an inexpensive camera, perfect for regular Zoom meetings or something similar."
"I purchased this camera as a replacement for my old one in which the microphone went on the fritz. The picture quality is good and the microphone is nice and clean. Hook up was easy and I like the camera lens cover. I am satisfied with this product."
"Great webcam. I use this daily instead of my laptop camera for teams meetings. Today I even used the speaker (instead of my headset) and everyone said they could hear me loud and clear. This has a nice picture when I’m on teams meetings and works great."
"I was about to buy the latest and greatest from NexiGo but after watching a Youtube review of it, the reviewer actually liked an older version better as the picture quality and lighting was much better, more natural, less overexposed spots/bright spots, and crisper image.The reviewer was right. I bought a cheaper NexiGo for my wife's setup but the colors and lighting wasn't good. But this model is really good, especially if you download the NexiGo App and tweak your settings for your particular lighting conditions.The only thing that's annoying is that every time I use the camera, it reverts to the default settings and I have to open the app, select my saved presets, and load them. Not a big deal but would be nice if there was a setting to make a certain preset the ""default.""As for the microphone, it produces a slightly too crisp sound. I had to cover both microphone openings on the unit with some magic eraser sponge pieces taped in place. Adding a small LED ring light to the top of my monitor really helped with the lighting/color. I didn't need a fancy, big lighting setup to get a nice, natural daytime look to my video image.Overall a great product for the price."
"I have weekly zoom meetings with my employer & team, so a working camera is crucial.  The built-in camera on my laptop started behaving like a 1980s TV with foil-covered rabbit-ear antennas on that one iffy channel (yep, I'm that old).  My boss was irritated with this situation, and she's not one to suffer irritants very long (No, she's not mean, just expects & provides high-quality).So I ordered this the second time my camera caused enough distortion to merit comment & it was here before the next meeting. It clipped & connected easily to my laptop, stayed put throughout the meeting, and the image was so clear that my boss asked if I'd gotten a new camera, stating that it was the cleanest picture ever.  It's performance hasn't decreased in the weeks I've been using it, so I'm very pleased."
"I set this web cam up at the office for meetings. No it no drivers to install. Just had to plug it in. Was very clear.and came with a cap to cover the lens if not in use. Very good buy for the price."
"bought this to replace the 30fps model of this camera as it died after 1 year of use. so far its been worrking fine. I have had it for around 6 months and use it weekly. good quality for Zoom and Youtube streaming. Auto focus is ok could be faster but good the the price. hope it last longer then the 30fps verson. do not recommend using it to record video for youtube just seems to be a little off on the colors, but is good for streaming"
"Love it."
"Works great, always wanted a webcam however… I don’t think I actually needed it. I’m not a streamer either. I don’t do anything that actually requires me to have a webcam. I really wasted money on something I didn’t actually need sadly.BUT, if you’re a streamer or your work requires a webcam, I think this would be worth for the money. I already have the Logitech app for my headset so all I did was plugged in the usb and it connected so it was easy.The picture quality is decent but in the app, you’re able to adjust settings to your liking. I think the microphone quality might be terrible but it’s fine because it’s 2024, why are we using webcam microphones lol.Anyways, I could’ve gotten other webcams like the ones trending via TikTok but I didn’t want to risk it and since this brand is known to be good, I spent the money."
"I recently purchased the Logitech C920x HD Pro Webcam, and it has exceeded my expectations! The video quality is outstanding, delivering full HD 1080p at 30fps, which makes a noticeable difference during video calls. Whether I’m on Skype, Zoom, or FaceTime, the clarity is fantastic, and my colleagues and friends have commented on how crisp and vibrant my image looks.The stereo audio is also impressive; the sound is clear and captures my voice without distortion, making it perfect for meetings and streaming. The HD light correction feature ensures I look great even in low-light conditions.Setting it up was a breeze—just plug and play, and it works seamlessly with my laptop. The adjustable clip allows me to mount it easily on my monitor."
"I purchased this camera on Prime Day Deals, and it is working with no issues. I updated my drivers before installing and it has a clear picture and sound. I use it for Zoom meeting mostly. Great for the money. It doesn't have any of the fancy features that the other Logitech cameras have but t fits my needs. The reviews were great on this camera as well by people that have used other brand cameras with all the features. I highly recommend."
"I was an upgrade to my previous Logitech Webcam.  Works well, easy set up, few problems.  A good value."
"I had an old Logitech camera that I have been using for many years on my Mac Mini.  Lately it either wouldn't work or it would stop working in the middle of a call.  I borrowed my wife's camera and it worked fine.  So I decided to get the C-920x and so far I'm very happy with it.  It works on the Mac with Discord which is what we often use to video chat with family members.  The camera worked as soon as I plugged it in without me doing anything. The video is so good I'll have to hire a makeup man!  This is a big improvement in both audio and video quality!"
"I've used two different webcams now. One was an Emeet which was complete rubbish. The other was an older Logitech variant. This C920 is VERY impressive. GHUB recognized it instantly! No fuss what so ever. Allows me to adjust all of my image settings like brightness, contrast, etc. I was able to turn off auto focus which was a huge benefit! I play a lot of edh and I can't recommend this camera enough."
"I had an old Logitech webcam that stopped working after a recent Microsoft Windows update. There was no driver update available, so I decided to get a new webcam. I plugged in this webcam and it just worked. No software installation was needed. It has excellent video and sound quality."
"I purchased this when my job allowed me to work remotely 3 days per week. It fits right on top of my curved monitor at the perfect height. The microphone is clear from what others have told me and the camera picture looks great. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good working web cam. For the record, I'm running Windows 11 and have had no issues with the camera being detected and working."
"I recently purchased the EMEET 1080P Webcam with Microphone, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The setup was incredibly easy with its plug-and-play functionality, and it was recognized by my computer instantly. The video quality is outstanding, offering crisp and clear Full HD 1080p resolution that makes my video calls look professional.One of the standout features is the dual omnidirectional microphones with noise reduction. They capture my voice clearly, even in a noisy environment, ensuring that I am heard perfectly during meetings. The wide 90-degree field of view is also a great addition, allowing more of my workspace to be visible without any distortion.The webcam performs exceptionally well in various lighting conditions, thanks to its low-light correction feature. Whether I’m in a brightly lit room or a dimly lit space, the image quality remains sharp and vibrant. The built-in tripod thread is a thoughtful touch, providing flexibility in positioning the camera exactly where I need it.Overall, the EMEET 1080P Webcam with Microphone is an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their video conferencing experience. It’s a great value for the price, and I highly recommend it for both personal and professional use."
"I bought the EMeet 1080P Webcam to improve video quality for Zoom and Teams calls, and it’s been excellent. Setup is simple, and for the price, both the video and audio quality are impressive. I recommend downloading Logitech’s G-Hub software, which makes optimizing picture and sound a breeze. I’ve used it for three years now without a single issue—highly recommend for anyone looking to enhance their video call experience!"
"I purchased this camera for an online class. It works well, was plug and play, super affordable. All in all the product is great for what it is. I really like that is came with a privacy cover. No issues with the picture when inside the focus range, or the mic both are super clear. I will say that I only use this camera for testing. I have never attempted to use this camera for anything else because I have no desire to stream or make video calls.The only ""issue"" I have is the listing. I really wish it had been in the product name that this is a fixed focus camera. There is another model of this camera on this listing for an Auto-focus camera for only 5 dollars more and I miss took the AF to mean Air Force (all thanks to growing up in a military community,) thinking it was just for a special color so I never even clicked on it. It is now the next quarter at my school and my new instructor is super picky about being able to read my name on my photo ID which this camera can't clearly provide. The auto-focus model can provide a clearer picture from slightly closer then the fixed focus camera can. I definitely learned my lesson and will be reading the full product description going forward.This is not the camera for you if you need to be able to show small print in a recorded video."
"Pic is good, mic sound good, wide angle view, easy use, would buy again"
"Really clear picture, well made, and no muss setup as well as affordable."
"For what this is... it is fine.  This is a great example of ""you get what you pay for"".  If you are looking for a quick replacement for your pc webcam, this might be okay.  I know youre not going to get incredible quality for 30 bucks, but my expectations were still a bit higher for this item, due to the product description and photos.  Otherwise, I would rate it higher and just accept that I bought a cheaper webcam.My main issues -The angle is super wide and not adjustable. I would've had to edit each video in post to ""zoom in"", which is just extra work.You can only make basic picture adjustments, even with the software that auto-installs upon plugging in the device. I could not ever get the exposure to look anything but overexposed.The picture is not super clear, maybe unless you have perfect lighting.  Just with regular warm room lighting, I had serious white glare on my face.The picture can be a little... ""jumpy""(?) lol - hopefully you kinda know what I mean.  Nothing drastic, but just enough to notice the lower quality.I never tested the mic.  The video quality was bad enough that I didn't ever actually try the mic.If you want to use this for streaming, or recording for youtube, etc.. and you are not a lighting/camera expert, just spend the extra money on a better cam.  I ended up getting the Logitech streamcam.  That one was great out of the box, before I even turned on my recording lighting.But again, if this is just for zoom calls, and you just need a quick and easy cam, maybe you can try this one.I should have returned it, but I waited too long. Oops lol."
"Had a zoom call and no camera - ordered it and it came fast and flawless.  Great picture and worked perfectly"
"As someone who streams and was looking to update my camera this was definitely a great purchase without breaking the bank. Works well and has a great mic. Additive features to also make you look better and crisp."
"Great camera! , plug and play no config required , perfect price"

"This 1080p webcam is outstanding and exceeded all my expectations! The video quality is crystal-clear, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make video calls and streaming look incredibly professional. The built-in microphone captures sound perfectly, eliminating the need for an external mic, and the noise-cancellation feature ensures clear audio even in busy environments. The webcam is easy to set up, with a plug-and-play design that works seamlessly with my computer and software. Its adjustable mount and wide-angle lens provide versatility, making it ideal for any setup. Highly recommend this webcam for anyone looking for excellent quality at an affordable price!"
"Before buy this little one, I used my laptop camera for chatting which would give a poor image, when my face comes up in the display, it looks like I get some kind of illness, my face has a uncomfortable color.Well, this little camera has much better image defination and light control to keep things looking as they should be. The camera can be mounted on my laptop and is easy to adjust the field of view. It was very simple to install. it has USB cable carried, just plug in my laptop. Also no app needed when I connected the camera, just went into my settings and chose the camera as the video source and either the camera's speakers or my headphones as the audio source depending on what I feel like that day. The built in speakers are fine, and it have 2, as they say, it can make the sound more stereo, what I feel is that the sound is clear than my laptop's. Overall, a quality purchase for the cost and as long as you're okay with a relatively large camera on top on your monitor, this is a good choice."
"I like the black outlet and the special design, I can put it on the table or clip on top of my laptop, Well listed some featuers of it, Easy installation, solid picture quality, good light sensitivity, good price, and good quality build, texture is also not bad, have to say, a great value for my money"
"This camera was truly just plug and play.  Plugged into my PC and was up an running with it in zoom.  The image quality is decent for a sub $100 1080p webcam and has a good field of view.  The clip easily supports it on top of the monitor."
"The camera was easy to connect and install. I use it for meeting so far and it seemed to work well. The picture quality is very good and the sound works well too, it is true FHD as they said. The view angel is pretty large for me and match with the movable clip, a bigger view!!!"
"I recently bought this webcam, and I have to say it's awsome! The clarity is impressive, and it’s incredibly quick in terms of performance. the focus is pretty good, image is clear and shows more details, even in different lighting conditions. I’ve been using it with a complementary light, and the results are amazing—crisp, clear video every time. Overall, this webcam has exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, reliable option."
"The camera has good quality and no need much time to set up. just plug it into a USB port on my computer and good to go. I like to put it on top of my monitor, also you can just place it on your table, when I get meetings on teams, just pick up, the vioce and sounds transimission are great, it has 1080P fhd and dual microphone inside as they described, which makes my meeting enjoyable and relaxing."
"I needed a camera for video calls. Plugged in and it just worked. Focus tracks well. I clipped it on the monitor, the design is great and steady. Worked perfectly without setup on both Zoom and Google Meet. just plug it in and those programs recognize it, the drives might be free to install. The image is fhd as advertised, and the microphone is good and clear too. If you're looking for one for your work, it is."
"Easy to assemble and portable! The material wasn‚Äôt flimsy and it‚Äôs easy to store. The clamps were a life saver to keep the sheets from swaying. Also great length coverage! The gold was an 8 feet by 8 feet"
"Awesome stand, light weight, easy to assemble and move around. üëå and"
"Giving this a 5 star for the easy set up.  I think with the little black sandbags given it is more for indoor use.  I used this stand outside to take school pictures for two days.  Both days were not that windy however the first day we got just a little breeze every now and then. The stand FELL OVER multiple times with the little breezes of wind. Nothing gusty! Light gently breezes really. Very frustrating.  Second day as you can see in my picture here I used my friends much bigger and heavier sandbags.  They worked much better! I still like this set up and the title does say studio, so for indoor you should have no problems with it falling over at all. I just wanted to let you know if you use it outdoors make sure you get yourself some larger heavier sandbags to use. I do really like it though."
"I‚Äôm a photographer who lives somewhere that experiences winter 9 months of the year. I needed a way to continue my business without the great outdoors on extremely cold days. This backdrop helped me so much with that! Easy to set up. Quality is okay. Sheet is fairly thin, think cheap bedsheet. Fairly stable and it comes with weighted bags to help support it if you feel it‚Äôs not sturdy enough. Here‚Äôs are some of my first shoots I did after purchasing. (Valentines minis)"
"easy to assemble, sturdy, and you can adjust the height and width. Simple and just what you need!!"
"Overall, a backdrop stand is a wise investment for anyone involved in photography or event planning. It combines functionality with ease of use, allowing both seasoned professionals and novices to elevate their projects. While it has minor stability issues outdoors, the benefits vastly outweigh this concern. I highly recommend adding a backdrop stand to your toolkit it's a game changer for creating stunning visual scenes. Whether for personal pleasure or professional service, you won't regret having this versatile piece of equipment on hand."
"Worked great- disassembled easily and comes with a storage bag, it was great for my purposes at a good price."
"I bought this backdrop stand to use as a stand for my projector to cut out patterns. While it holds the projector, and can support that weight, It is definitely not super sturdy without the sandbags. And unfortunately one of my sand bags has major holes in boths sides making it a major mess and difficult to repair. I'm using tape for now as I need to get to sewing. I would say the stitching on the bags leaves something to be desired. Hence my lower star review.  I'll update my review after I've used it a few times."
"I needed a way to show some large artwork and the Emart Photo Backdrop worked perfectly. Mind you, this was indoors. It came with sandbags (but no sand) that I yet have to test outdoors. It's not a heavy construction, which makes it light to carry, but it remains to be seen how it will fare outdoors. However, it was simple to assemble and looks professional. This product also comes with sandbags, but some other products don't, which is great. It also has some extra caps (to secure the cross bar) in case we lose the original ones. This product is worth it."
"Review of the 10' X 12' backdropCovered floor to ceiling on an entire wall.So VERY HAPPY with this purchase.Great for Birthdays, Anniversaries, Graduations, New Years most any celebration you can think of.Could also be used as a more permanent room decor.It makes a beautiful backdrop for photos, but what was most impressive (and unexpected) was how it changed the look of the room. It sets the ambiance in a room far better than balloons, banners and other smaller decor items. Best bang for the buck of any decor item I've ever purchased. It was perfect for our New Years Eve party.Obviously looks great in photos and since we purchased a very large backdrop there were no visible edges in photos and no one is standing beyond the backdrop, like what happens with smaller backdrops. Worked easily for groups of 10-12 people but would readily accommodate larger groups since it covered ceiling to floor and wall to wall.It is sturdy fabric, had no wrinkles when hung and we used 4 - 20lb command strips to secure it in place. I was afraid it would fall halfway through the evening but it was still hanging the next morning. I imagine it would stay there as long was we wanted with just 4 command strips. That means you can put it up days in advance.It's sturdy enough to use time and again for years to come. I don't see why it wouldn't last 10 or more years if taken care of.It's not sheer or see through. But, when we placed ours on a wall that had  alcove lights behind the backdrop, it did lighten it up a bit. While nothing too noticeable, it does add potential for a different feel to the backdrop. That may be something to try to see if you like it.Highly recommend."
"I used this for a 1920s Great Gatsby themed party, but this is such a versatile backdrop it could be used for many occasions. I plan to save it for other uses like new years eve, any celebration, etc. One thing I noticed about this backdrop is how easy it was to steam the creases out. I've bought other kinds that were really hard to steam.. but this one I was so pleasantly surprised how much I was able to flatten out. I almost wish I went for the full 8x8 size so that it touched the ground better on my backdrop stand. So check your sizing for your needs. All the pictures looked so nice with the backdrop. Classy and vibrant."
"The product is study and great quality. It is not as vibrant as the photo but I still thought it looked good."
"Bought for a grad party photo backdrop. Very nice quality. Reusable. Looks great in photos. Wish it had come in a bigger size. Our almost 6' tall people were too tall."
"Worked out great with the Decorations and Balloons"
"This is nice and heavy and can be folded and reused and doesn't show fold marks."
"The SJOLOON Black and Gold Backdrop is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to elevate their party or family gathering. Whether you’re planning a birthday party, family event, or special occasion, this vintage-inspired vinyl backdrop brings an elegant touch with its black and gold design accented with gold spots. The backdrop is both eye-catching and versatile, offering a sophisticated background for photographs.The material is sturdy vinyl, which makes it easy to hang and wrinkle-resistant, ensuring your photos look professional without much hassle. The color contrast between black and gold creates a luxurious and timeless look that fits a variety of themes—be it a classy birthday bash or a chic celebration.The quality of the print is sharp, and it’s large enough to work as a statement piece behind your photo area or stage setup. However, depending on your setup, it might need some extra care with proper lighting to avoid shadows and ensure that the gold spots shine.If you’re looking for a backdrop that stands out and adds a touch of elegance, this one’s a great option that delivers both in style and practicality."
"Ordered and received within 3 days...perfect for photo backdrop"
"Got this for the fiancé’s Birthday, looked awesome and I can use it again in the future if needed.Would totally recommend!"
"This made such a cute backdrop for New Years Eve photos and celebrations. It was large enough to not see the ends in photos and I'd definitely recommend for any glitzy celebration!"
"Bought as a backdrop for my kids Birthday party. Held up well! Looked nice. No wrinkles.easy to use and great length"
"Affordable and durable. Great price and great fabric for backdrop. Wrinkle resistant"
"Wanted inexpensive white curtains to use as swags for barn wedding. These were perfect. Not too flimsy, not cheap looking. Good size. Was able to cover stalls and doors for a nicer aesthetic."
"Bought it for my daughter's 15th birthday party. Worked great! It's medium thickness, not see-thru, great flow; falls nice for a backdrop. Also, easy to maintain, regular wash and it still looks great."
"I loved these curtains.  Really good quality.  Prefect for a wedding back drop"
"Heavy, not sheer at all - which we wanted, but not all do.  Used for a wedding reception photo backdrop, keeping to reuse - possibly as window curtains. Heavy weight, but draped well! True, “bright” white."
"I bought these for a backdrop for my Aunt’s wedding.  They were perfect.  Very nice material"
"I got this for a bridal shower to use as a Photo Booth area. The set up was so easy! It’s extremely affordable and durable! This is great for photo booths or photographers! I plan on using it to take photos of my son to save someMoney and will be using it at any event I host for a Photo Booth!"
"Bought to take photos of my artwork and I love the outcome! The photos are amazing and require minimal editing. Also works great for taking blacklight photos of my blacklight-reactive art. (I bought battery operated blacklights that are easy to set up in the lightbox).I don't have room to keep a lightbox set up at all times so I needed something that was easy to put up and take down. This one fits the bill and I'm excited to start using it more."
"I am thrilled with everything about this light box!This light box is compact for easy storage or portability (it collapses flat and stores nicely in the included tote) it is very quick easy to set up, has three different light modes (warm, white and soft) with adjustable brightness levels for each and also has a diffuser screen to soften the light,12 different background colors, and best of all it allows for multi-angle shooting (over head/overlook and straight on/tile).Such a great value for so much versatility!!"
"Great and easy to store, size as promised, lots of colors bg. Fast to fold or install."
"My only negatives so far, 1.  It would be nice to know what the light settings are.  2. Maybe there's no fix for this, but when taking pictures of custom paints, it doesn't show the color flips like the sun does.  Other than that, I love it.  A nice carry/storage case, a bunch of different background sheets that don't bleed through and fit in nice.  Way better light than most rooms have for taking pictures.  I'm always making things and I like to take pics of them, and this is going to make this a lot easier and give me nicer pictures."
"Easy to use and great quality"
"This box allows my husband to do the kind of photography he likes. It is light weight, collapses for easy storage and came with a pack of backgrounds that he likes.  A very good purchase for the price."
"I make small leather goods (wallets, lighter cases etcetera) this is exactly what I needed for my product photography. Very easy to set up and put away. The lighting is adjustable and meets my needs. A number of different colored backgrounds came with it. The one recommendation I have would be maybe to wear gloves when handling the backgrounds. Specifcially the black one seems to pick up any oils that might be on your skin. 10 out of 10 would recommend for anyone needing to do product photography for smaller items."
"I bought this to take photos of jewelry I sell. The diffuser doesn't work that great. Still too much glare even at different angles. So I can't use the top section to take pictures because then the glare is way too much. I take pictures of fine jewelry with gemstones and glass cabachons with art work in the bezel. The reflection of the glass at any angle is do bad it distorts the actual art work.  It is nice quality, and may work well for certain items just not what I need it for."
"The PULUZ Mini Photo Studio Light Box is a great choice for capturing professional-quality product photos. Its foldable design is convenient, and the CRI >95 LED lights ensure vibrant, accurate colors. With six double-sided color backgrounds, it offers flexibility for various photo styles. Easy to assemble and portable, it‚Äôs perfect for small businesses or hobbyists looking for high-quality results at a great price."
"The PULUZ Mini Photo Studio Light Box is a fantastic tool for small product photography. The portable and folding design makes it easy to set up anywhere, and it‚Äôs compact enough to take on the go. With 96 LED lights and a CRI >95, it provides excellent lighting that brings out true colors in photos. The kit comes with 6 double-sided color backgrounds, which add versatility and let you create various looks for different products. Perfect for capturing high-quality images of small items. Highly recommend for hobbyists or small business owners!"
"I just received my Poluz 16 x 16 photo box. I have not had a chance to use it consistently or on a regular basis, so this review is based off my first impression.It seems like my package had been torn open or possibly opened before, or perhaps a return judging from the box. The blue and salmon colored backgrounds were dirty; the salmon colored one definitely has been used!The pro‚Äôs are that it‚Äôs extremely easy to use, does the job and is a good value for the money. The diffuser cloth helps with reflections from the led lights. The many different backgrounds are a huge plus, there‚Äôs a great variety. Easy set up and break down.The cons are that it arrived possibly used/2 backdrops are dirty. Because I don‚Äôt plan to use those particular back drops that much, and I want to hurry up and start using this‚ÄîI will probably just hold on to itüôÑüòë but I‚Äôd like to return or exchange for a new one. I also wish the LED lights lit up brighter, but it will do the job. I also wanted to be able to shoot objects with a consistent light source or consistent look ‚Äîso it will do that. Doesn‚Äôt come with USB power adapter.Overall, would recommend but hopefully you will get one that is new new, clean and perfect. Good choice for a grinding artist, photographer or seller that just needs to get it done."
"First and foremost, the size of the lightbox is perfect for smaller photography needs. At 12""x12"", it strikes the ideal balance between portability and functionality. Whether I'm capturing small products for my online store or snapping creative shots for social media, this lightbox provides ample space to work with while remaining compact enough to set up anywhere.The quality of illumination is outstanding. Equipped with built-in LED lights, this light box delivers consistent, flicker-free lighting that ensures my subjects are perfectly illuminated from every angle. The adjustable brightness settings allow for precise control over the lighting intensity, enabling me to achieve the desired mood and ambiance for each shot.One of the standout features of this lightbox is its versatility. The front and top openings provide multiple shooting angles, allowing for endless creative possibilities. Whether I'm shooting from above, below, or through the front opening, I can easily experiment with different perspectives to capture stunning images from every angle.Setup is a breeze thanks to the collapsible design. The lightbox can be effortlessly folded and unfolded in seconds, making it convenient to transport and store when not in use. Plus, the included carrying case ensures that I can take my photography studio on the go without any hassle.Furthermore, the durability of this lightbox is impressive. Constructed from high-quality materials, it feels sturdy and well-built, able to withstand the rigors of regular use without any signs of wear or tear.In conclusion, the Light Box Photography 12""x12"" is a game-changer for photographers of all skill levels. Its compact size, impeccable lighting, versatility, and durability make it an invaluable tool for capturing professional-quality images with ease. Whether you're a hobbyist, a content creator, or a small business owner, this light box is sure to take your photography to the next level. I highly recommend it without hesitation!"
"The Mini Photo Studio Light Box has been perfect for taking product shots. It‚Äôs easy to set up, and the built-in lights provide even, bright illumination, which really enhances photo quality. The multiple backgrounds are a nice touch for adding variety. It‚Äôs compact but gives a professional feel to my photos. Great value for a portable mini studio!"
"I love my picture box! It‚Äôs taken my staging game up a notch and makes my advertising look so professional and clear.I do wish they‚Äôd sell their backgrounds Separately and maybe come up with some new colours and schemes."
"* Easy to assemble* Incredibly good lighting* Very user-friendly with the control to adjust lighting* Incredibly nice result (with the right camera equipment)* The size is right for my products (grocery products)Recommend the product for every penny, absolutely nothing to complain about.I drive with my iPhone and am happy with the results"
"Came well packaged with nice storage bags and love the backgrounds. Easy to assemble and came with all working parts."
"We used this for my church directory photos and it was so easy to set up and take down. Great product."
"I really like the stand. It’s very easy to use and set up. It stayed put and the extras. The only thing I didn’t like are the backdrops. They are literally bedsheets with a pocket for the poles. Will be buying better backdrops."
"I liked it a lot, and I loved the quality, I know it will be a blessing and very useful for my business. 100/10"
"I was fortunate enough to get this on a flash deal and I’m so glad I did! Everything is superb quality and comes securely packed. Everything fits in the case it comes with and that makes it easy to travel! Everything has its own bag or box and that also makes everything a lot more safe and organized. The lighting quality is also really great! I would definitely recommend this to any content creator or any kind! I’ve been able to do product shoots, portrait photography, videos, and stop motion animation with this bundle!"
"i love this light kit. it’s easy to set up, the lights stay cool and consistent and it’s super easy to set up and tear down."
"Great for start up booth. Have taken photo shoots & headshots with this booth. Need to iron cloths"
"The media could not be loaded."
"I was concerned about purchasing this set due to reviews about how flimsy the set was but I was pleasantly surprised.Granted, the set is of not top quality but you are not paying for it either.  People complaining about tripods falling is because they do not know how to work with tripods.  I used the set to take picture of heavy hoists and never had an issue if you know how to move around a photographic set.Pros: Easy to setup.  Nice tripod and bars.  4 sets of lights.Cons: lights too weak.  45w are not enough for us.  Quality of the white backdrop is not good as good as the one we already had.  Reflector bag came ripped but we can live with it.Overall, we are very satisfied with the product."
"Everything was complete and neatly packaged in the shipping boxes.  Yes, the backdrop stand allows the green screen to sag a bit, and the material is a bit sheer,  but we mounted the green screen to the wall and will use the stand when we need to travel with the equipment.  We purchased this for our son's birthday and he loves it.  Best part is that all this equipment, when set up, fits into the small space of his room and allows his bedroom to become a production studio.  Absolutely the perfect gift for YouTubers."
"If your getting into Photography, great set to start with"
"I set up the equipment and backdrop last night and I am quite happy with it so far! It seems a little unstable for the back drop if you put all 4 bars in it but I used it with 3 bars and it's more sturdy! I am quite happy with my purchase so far. I am going to use it on a newborn photoshoot in a couple days!"
"Seems to be a great product, first time buyer and beginner, easy to assemble, straightforward, came with all parts, took maybe 15 minutes to assemble."
"After comparing several lighting options I selected this one for the price and hoped the quality would be good. It arrived on time and was everything I expected. Easy set up and great quality items. I was able to set up everything myself for an indoor shoot and it exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend!"
"You get a lot of items for the price. I dropped a bulb and broke it right off the bat. Sigh. At least, there was still enough bulbs to fit into the two boxes I‚Äôll use most of the time.  I‚Äôm pretty happy with my purchase. So many different photography items in one box"
"Pros: Love the kit , definitely worth buying the kit for the price it is selling for. It‚Äôs definitely worth it for someone who is trying to start off in photography! Stands and poles are sturdy, light bulbs included, sand bag included, 3 soft boxes, 2 silver umbrellas, 1 gold umbrella & 2 white umbrellas, backdrop stand, 3 backdrops (white, black & green) & a case to hold everything. Unfortunately my kit was missing the clamps and the reflectors but overall for the price - it was a good purchase.Cons: light bulbs are not bright enough (a lot of comments saying they changed to LED lights bulbs which made a huge difference), wires are not long enough so you‚Äôll need multiple extension cords, the backdrops are super thin so they are see-through so I‚Äôd suggest putting the black one behind the white backdrop if you're going to use the white one or green to block out the back lighting."
"For this price, you get a lot more than what you needed and paid for! The box was super heavy, I could lift it up myself that my husband has to help me. I set everything up and see which or what kind of lighting works better for me. Light works very great for indoor. I would love to try outdoor maybe in the future. I used it to take photos of my kids and portrait for my business cards. It is very easy to use and comes with bags for every items and a big bag to put everything in."
"This came sooo quickly and so far so good! Everything looks great ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"One of my lights came broken, Great setup and Still worth it, but send me a new bulb please?"
"Easy set up for beginners, or people with basic to moderate photography knowledge. Great selection of things for when you‚Äôre on a budget or in between jobs. It was perfect for my headshot session. The cloth backgrounds are the only complaint I have, they never look good to me personally. I would‚Äôve loved this set more if it had a paper background option instead. All around, really quality set!"
"You get a lot of useful stuff to control the lighting for photo or even video projects. I personally switched out the CFLs for color changing LED bulbs which made the system even more versatile but did increase the cost. I highly recommend this kit for anyone getting started in photography or videography."
"These softbox lights are excellent! The quality is great, they are easy to set up, and the lighting is perfect for photography or video projects. The set includes everything you need, and the carrying bag is a nice bonus for portability."
"10/10.Only 1 light type, make sure you know that! it works perfectly for our content wall though for sure. Great, great lights. Super easy set up. really nice packaging. really nice usage."
"I received the dual kit today which I bought with a $10.50 discount.  Which means for $65.38 I got two lights with stand, the hood and the cover to make it a softbox light.I agree this is not professional equipment.  However, for $65.00 I wouldn't be able to buy one complete professional softbox.  In fact, I would probably need to spend at minimum another $100 just to get the cheapest professional gear.All that being said.  I am not a professional but an amateur and I do this mostly as a hobby.  I am very happy to have two of these lights and I am happy to say that mine came packed expertly and everything came in full working order.  I love that it all has a carrying case and that the light bulbs came inside a box with molded Styrofoam.I am very satisfied and I have to say after testing it on some self portraits today, I am very satisfied.  What I really like about this is that I can remove the cover of the softbox and almost use it as an umbrella light.I uploaded some self-portraits and a view of the setup.  The first photo with the softer tones it's the softbox with the cover and the second without the cover.  I also show the setup with the light off and on.If you are looking for a sturdy, professional equipment which will stand the test of time.  This is probably not the equipment you want.  If you are an amateur or beginning and have a limited budget then this will probably serve you well, provided you take care of it.A note of caution.  When extending the legs there is a sweet spot where the legs have the most spread.  Below or above that spot the area the legs spread is smaller and may cause the equipment to fall over.  See the images for what I mean.  The way the stand works is almost like how an umbrella opens and so you'll have to take care to make sure leave about 3 to 4 inches from the bottom of the pole to the junction of the legs (see images for visual)."
"I recently purchased two softboxes for improving my video lighting setup as a full-time remote worker. Overall, I found them to be easy to assemble and effective for the price point.The assembly process was straightforward, and I appreciated the simplicity of putting them together. They provide excellent lighting for my video calls and work well for my needs.While the included bag adds convenience for storage and transportation, I found the kickstands to be somewhat flimsy. To prevent them from easily tipping over, I would recommend weighting them down. However, despite this minor issue, they haven’t fallen over on their own, which is reassuring.In conclusion, these softboxes have successfully fulfilled their purpose for me, and I would consider purchasing them again. Despite the slight inconvenience with the kickstands, they offer good value for the price and I recommend them for anyone looking to enhance their WFH video lighting setup."
"Overall this is an amazing set of lights. The quality of photos and videos is much better. Perception of depth is good as well once you start using these lights.Setup: All the items comes very well boxed and packaged by the manufacturer. The setup process was fairly easy and took less than 10 minutes to unpack and setup for the first useQuality: The box comes with a pair of bulbs, nicely boxed in. Once set up the light was adequate enough for some great shots. This is very good for a home studio or vlogging setup.Stand: The stand itself was a bit tricky to assemble for the first time. However, once I got used to the first one setting up the second one was a breeze. The only issue I saw was that above 5 feet, the stand being top heavy becomes a bit unstable. i had to adjust the legs again to give the unit some stability. Once you are aware of this, you will be able to take care of ensuring the legs are supporting the unit well and stable.The wires are also heavy and when the stand is farther way from a power source, extending the wires can make the stand unstable as well. This is the same for most other softbox kits as well. So not restricted to the Neewer ones alone.Highly recommend this gear for amateur or professional setup."
"Far from “premium quality”, but they work fine and I’m sure they will last a long time if they aren’t abused or put up/down all of the time."
"Good cost affordable solution for office lighting."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



It shipped really fast. It was easy to assemble, took me less than 3 minutes to get it working.  This was a micro milestone for my small business. My product photo quality has been drastically improved. Getting professional product photos is everything nowadays for online retail. If you are starting an online retail business or needing professional photos, i’d highly recommend getting one of these."
"First off, everything arrived in good condition and I set them up very easily on my own. I'm a webcam model so I needed some good lighting for my videos and streaming online at a good price. I had looked around on amazon.com and amazon.ca for a while for something available that suited my needs. I ended up going for this one and was worried the lighting may not be warm enough but I have just tried them and filmed a short 30 sec video to test them out and WOW!!! They are pretty amazing. The room I am in is small and has no window and a very dim ceiling light and yet I look so clear and well lit. If you wanted it to be a bit brighter then I would suggest a using a window, or just some extra lights would do the trick but I like the amount of light they provide and for my needs they are perfect!"
"There are no instructions to put this together, although not hard, it is possible to be a little bit confusing.So far the lights are going great!  I am a amateur and just starting out in taking pictures and making youtube videos so these lights work great for me so far. I was worried even though all the online reviews and videos show that it goes very bright even in basements and it does a fairly good job. I live in a condo and all the lights emit a bright orange colour so all my videos and pictures are always orange when I take them. But with this I noticed an immediate difference and no longer is there any orange in my pictures or vids.Overall, I thought this was a decent deal and a good product so far."
"I used it for a couple shoots and it works pretty good. not a crazy brightness but it does the job. however if you are taking pictures of a group of people it's harder to bring the lights close enough to illuminate the subject and not have them in the frame. For a one subject shoot it's perfect for a beginner. I recommend this product for beginners. Pretty good price for what you get."
"Didn't have to wait long for it to arrive . Other reviews talked about not having instructions to put it together but it was super easy to do. Had it assembled very quickly. The stands are a little flimsy but if you are careful not to bump into it there should be no problem. Lights are huge (and bright). I am very pleased with the quality for the price and would recommend this product."
"I gotta say, for how much I spent, it's appreciated whenever I buy appliances that require light bulbs come packaged WITH lightbulbs!The softboxes provide even and diffused light, ensuring professional-quality results for both photography and video shoots. With 3 color background screens included, this kit offers versatility for various shooting scenarios, allowing for creativity and flexibility.The backdrop stands and tripod stands are robustly constructed, providing stability during shoots. Additionally, the setup is straightforward, saving time and effort, and with easy-to-carry tote bags included, I can setup and disassemble in less than 10 minutes.Considering the comprehensive kit with backdrop stands, softboxes, tripod stands, and color background screens, this product offers exceptional value for both amateur and professional photographers and videographers."
"This set has everything you need for a setup to take pictures or videos! The stands adjust easily and to many different positions. It all feels well built and like it will hold up to use for a long time. I love the options for the lighting to get different effects. It stores easily in the storage bag. There is plenty of room for everything, so I don‚Äôt have to fight to fit it in the bag. This is a great set and definitely worth the price! To buy everything separately, it would cost A LOT more!"
"I have had my camera for a year now and I have wanted to see if k can buy something like this, when it came it had everything, nothing broken or missing and it all worked perfectly. It‚Äôs great for starters or anyone who loves photography and wants to do photo shootsI have done only one photo shoot and it was before I bough this, I was nervous but getting paid good money and the person wasn‚Äôt very happy since I didn‚Äôt bring equipment like lights, background, tripods, etc‚Ä¶So with the money she gave me I bough this, thinking it wasn‚Äôt gonna work out it came in and I posted it online and everyone is now interested in photo shoots with payNot only that, you can also use this as an advantage for other types of stuff like videos, movies, auditions, etc‚Ä¶The instruction manuals are very clear and shows you what the box is supposed to bring, the cool thing is that you can put EVERYTHING in one bag, it will be heavy but at least you can carry it around and not have it hang out in the way.I have a friend who has been a photographer for many years and this is the same setup she bought the first year she started and to this day she hasn‚Äôt changed from it100% Worth It!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I liked the configuration of this set. I can't wait to make creative videos at home. There are very powerful lamps, remote controls, there are several changeable backgrounds, all tripod mounts are of good quality, thank you."
"I really like this kit. The entire kit is lightweight. I am able to set it up under 10 minutes. I did not know that there were going to be three backdrops which is so cool. The lights aren‚Äôt the best but they do just great for the quality of photoshoot I wanted. I also like how there are options for different kind of shoots."
"Haven‚Äôt used yet, but set it up, and that was easy"
"I needed some black background for video and white for photography, these are lightweight yet sturdy, I may use the lights for backlighting but not as main lights,  I love that everything comes in a bag and some things are separated into their own bags inside the main bag, would have liked for the actual backdrops to be a little bigger but it's decent enough for my current needs."
"At first, when I opened the box, I was afraid there were no instructions. But they were at the bottom. Very clear pictures of how to assemble. Which was needed because since this is such a comprehensive kit, there are lots of different poles to connect to the lighting and some to hang the green screen on. The green screen was quite wrinkly, and I needed to wash and dry it to get the wrinkles out before being able to use it. It was surprisingly great value for how much it cost. They are all very sturdy and definitely is a great starter kit for podcasting."
"The frame was sturdy but I could not figure out how to put it together.  The boxing was not good.  Wrapped around middle was a box in an oversized box.  I supposed it broke or was opened in transit by postal for inspection.  One light did not work.  Check lighting recommendations on YouTube by coaches... One suggested a light set with 40 watts and around$100,... then read the reviews of those light fixtures.  I did not keep this, but returned it."
"Easy to assemble and portable! The material wasn‚Äôt flimsy and it‚Äôs easy to store. The clamps were a life saver to keep the sheets from swaying. Also great length coverage! The gold was an 8 feet by 8 feet"
"Awesome stand, light weight, easy to assemble and move around. üëå and"
"Giving this a 5 star for the easy set up.  I think with the little black sandbags given it is more for indoor use.  I used this stand outside to take school pictures for two days.  Both days were not that windy however the first day we got just a little breeze every now and then. The stand FELL OVER multiple times with the little breezes of wind. Nothing gusty! Light gently breezes really. Very frustrating.  Second day as you can see in my picture here I used my friends much bigger and heavier sandbags.  They worked much better! I still like this set up and the title does say studio, so for indoor you should have no problems with it falling over at all. I just wanted to let you know if you use it outdoors make sure you get yourself some larger heavier sandbags to use. I do really like it though."
"I‚Äôm a photographer who lives somewhere that experiences winter 9 months of the year. I needed a way to continue my business without the great outdoors on extremely cold days. This backdrop helped me so much with that! Easy to set up. Quality is okay. Sheet is fairly thin, think cheap bedsheet. Fairly stable and it comes with weighted bags to help support it if you feel it‚Äôs not sturdy enough. Here‚Äôs are some of my first shoots I did after purchasing. (Valentines minis)"
"easy to assemble, sturdy, and you can adjust the height and width. Simple and just what you need!!"
"Overall, a backdrop stand is a wise investment for anyone involved in photography or event planning. It combines functionality with ease of use, allowing both seasoned professionals and novices to elevate their projects. While it has minor stability issues outdoors, the benefits vastly outweigh this concern. I highly recommend adding a backdrop stand to your toolkit it's a game changer for creating stunning visual scenes. Whether for personal pleasure or professional service, you won't regret having this versatile piece of equipment on hand."
"Worked great- disassembled easily and comes with a storage bag, it was great for my purposes at a good price."
"I bought this backdrop stand to use as a stand for my projector to cut out patterns. While it holds the projector, and can support that weight, It is definitely not super sturdy without the sandbags. And unfortunately one of my sand bags has major holes in boths sides making it a major mess and difficult to repair. I'm using tape for now as I need to get to sewing. I would say the stitching on the bags leaves something to be desired. Hence my lower star review.  I'll update my review after I've used it a few times."
"I needed a way to show some large artwork and the Emart Photo Backdrop worked perfectly. Mind you, this was indoors. It came with sandbags (but no sand) that I yet have to test outdoors. It's not a heavy construction, which makes it light to carry, but it remains to be seen how it will fare outdoors. However, it was simple to assemble and looks professional. This product also comes with sandbags, but some other products don't, which is great. It also has some extra caps (to secure the cross bar) in case we lose the original ones. This product is worth it."
"After reading some of the Reviews I was hoping for the best, and although there were some that were slightly Negative, all of my thoughts on this are now Positive.I was actually pretty happy with just the one light after I set it up, but when I set up the other, I was more than happy!Here's what I found when I got them both going...REMOTE:  You CAN use ONE remote for both and they will STILL work independently of each other. So, one remote can make the opposite, make one gradually change from Low Brightness to High Brightness, and using that same remote you can then aim at the other and change that one from High Brightness to Low Brightness, if you wanted.So, the Brightness of each is controlled easily however you want to use them, On, off, color-shift, or brightness.The REMOTE is the cheapest made part in this set-up, it is VERY lightweight and it's very cheaply made, and very thin. I am only going to be using one at a time anyway, so if one breaks, I can use the other. Not just that, but they come with new bulbs, see more below.I had read that this was not the case, but, I tested it more than a few times, it does work. I do not know why some people said that it didn't.This is a BIGGY for me, I do product style photography and I placed an object on 'center stage' and watched as the shadows grew and shrank as I played with the remote's Brightness.Before I got this I had to use paper towels for a soft filter, I would also use the supplied light filters, but using them alone is usually not enough to get the amount of light one might need.(I am not referring to color filters, that is different)This is set-up as a professional lighting system, it just works!SET-UP:  It all went together REALLY easy, and FAST too!These are not the best made light stands etc., that there is out there, but they are made well, and there's not much to screw up on these, and if you did break something, I am pretty sure it can be fixed easily, or, there may be parts out there that would fit, these appear to me to be very standard/generic stands, and of course, the light socket is standard stuff.MATERIAL:  The soft box itself is made well enough, if you take care of it, there's no reason that you would need to replace it, there is no stretching of it when erecting the set-up, so no stress, no problems.The same goes for what they call the white ""nylon cover"", it creates a very soft shadow when used, and although you are 'supposed to' remove it when placing back into the bag, you don't necessarily have to, and if you did every time, I can't see where that will ever wear out either. It's made well enough and it should serve you for many years to come.STAND:  The stand itself is sturdy enough, I don't foresee any problems at all, moving it up and down doesn't make it wear really, so this also should last for many, many sessions.Tightening and loosening the knobs are the only place that I can see that could create a problem when used over and over, it is the only place that might wear throughout time. Again though, these should be standard replacement parts from reputable online or brick and mortar stores. These are not the best, but for what you pay, they are worth every bit of it.If one broke during a shoot, just use gaffers tape until you get a new part.LIGHT:  Now, for the light itself, that is where my confidence dwindles, not yet, I just received it, but that will more than likely be where your first problem will arise. I have zero knowledge of this type of bulb, although it accepts the standard sizes bulbs used in your home, the dimming and color-shift parts of the bulb is what sets it apart from the rest.These are not super expensive, but they aren't that cheap either. They are sold by themselves, or in pairs  on Amazon and elsewhere, so finding them is not hard, or, that expensive.I believe that when you buy a new bulb (from what I saw on Amazon) you will also get a new remote, so that would mean that to get all of the bulb's features, you will need to buy one either exactly the same, or a similar one that would have its own remote, by a different brand.You could use ANY light bulb in this if you had to, you can use the on-off (only) switch on the electrical cord between the lamp and the wall plug. That would just be for an emergency type scenario.Buy a back-up set of lights, that would be my suggestion.One more thing on the lamp itself, they are 'soft lamps', not harsh, which is good most of the time. If you do end up needing a harsher light, it will not be what you want. As it happens, only yesterday on my first try I found that I needed a more harsh shadow, so I ended up using my old smaller LED lights.I'm sure that somewhere there are some lamps that are harsh, but these are not them.DOUBTS:  I did have doubts, but as of now, I am extremely impressed with this set-up, and if it continues to work like it is now I am a really happy customers, of course, time is the big factor here, time will tell.Aside from that, buy this, and if it works like mine, you will not be sorry."
"got this to do monthly milestone photos for my daughter. I have had no previous experience with lights like the but it was so so easy to set up and take down. the light is so bright and has a few color settings."
"The Orjim Softbox Photography Lighting Kit is a solid choice for anyone starting out in photography or looking for an affordable lighting solution. The 16” x 16” softboxes are lightweight, easy to set up, and provide nice, diffused lighting for portraits and product photography.My only wish is that they were a bit brighter for larger setups or when shooting in low-light conditions. That said, they work well for smaller projects and are a great value for the price. Overall, I’m happy with the purchase and would recommend it for light-duty photography needs."
"It's worth to buy this product.  The light is bright and has different modes. I found its extremely useful for taking pictures and videos.  The price is not expensive comparing to its service."
"These lights are amazing, they make my skin look so good. I always get insecure of my skin on videos, but these are fantastic. So worth the money. Buy them !! I got the premium ones."
"The lights are easy to set up and have different modes of operation.They work great and improves the picture quality.Would buy again"
"I use these everytime i do a photoshoot! Really easy to setup and use. Super bright, adjustable. Just plain great ❤️"
"The light works okay, but when you want to release the canopy, it is very difficult.  I am mechanically inclined, but cannot see how to release it.  I was able to magically get one box to release, but cannot release the second one.  There are NO INSTRUCTIONS at all for this product."
"I had originally gone with a cheaper set from another seller but that set of lights had a really bad strong metal smell that was giving me a headache. So I returned them and went with these lights instead. Let me just say, no metal smell. (Thank goodness)Overall, these lights have been everything I needed. The hexagon shape from the light reflectors give a more natural ""lighting"" to your photos and videos. Bright and clear on camera, easy to set up, seems more durable that the last set I tried out. Only time will tell with the longevity of these lights but for the most part, it seems like they will last if you take care of them. Also, they come with a storage bag to put everything up nice and neat when your done!Absolutely perfect for anyone who's trying to get that ""perfect lighting setup"" without breaking the bank!"
"Ordered this product and it was delivered next day. East set up. Came with instruction manual. Everything is in working condition including bulbs. Light weight. The only small complaint I had was the stains on one of the head covers. Not visible when light is used. Still, this will get the job done for a quick shoot. Word of advise… get some sand bags to weigh down the stands."
"Works good for the purpose I bought them."
"These are great economical lights. I use them for senior and hone portrait sessions and they move and fold up nice. Great lights for the money."
"I’m truly amazed at how much comes in this setup. This kit comes with a full lighting system and multiple backdrops, and even has a travel bag that every thing fits in perfectly (just remember how it was originally packed and you’ll be golden). I was elated that the kit is all inclusive, so everything from clamps to lightbulbs were included and I didn’t have to run out and get anything to complete set up. The portability of this product and ease with which I can assemble and disassemble everything is unbeatable. No additional tools are needed and on top of that I’m 5’7” and can easily extend the backdrop to its full height without needing any assistance or a stepping stool. I completely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a photography setup that they can take anywhere and everywhere. Do yourself a favor and get this kit!"
"Overall this is a good light set.  The stands for the lights are a little weak and you need to be careful with the cords pulling them over.  The package also was missing one of the light diffusing screens.  I e-mailed the vendor but haven't heard from them yet.  I'd be happy and would add more stars of they could just mail me one."
"This is a great starter kit for anyone needing lights for photography or video.  The stand is lightweight, but sturdy and is best suited for indoor work (though I used it on an outdoor shoot and it worked just fine and was stable).  The stand expands to full height at approx 6’ and has a diffuser to soften."
"We are avid game players and this is one of my top favorites! We have played with our family and new extended family. Everyone loves this game! It is easy and fun and helps break the ice with new people."
"Summary:  Herd Mentality is a game for 4+ players, ages 10+, from Big Potato Games.(Please see the enclosed pictures.)I highly recommend this game for any group game setting.Each round, a player draws a question, asks the crowd, and everyone (including the reader) writes down an answer.  Then, tally up the number of players with the same answer. The players who wrote the most common answer each get a point.The first player to eight points wins. If there is a tie for that round getting to eight points, the winning total goes to nine points and so on until there is a clear winner.One additional rule is important, if you give an answer that is the least popular then you win the ""pink cow."" You cannot get rid of the pink cow until someone else wins it. You cannot win the game until you get rid of the pink cow.Here are some examples, if four people are playing, and the question is ""what is the best flavor of ice cream?"" then you could have the following situations:Players A & B say vanilla, and players C & D say chocolate. There are no clear winners and no one gets the pink cow.Players A & B say vanilla, player C says chocolate, and player D says strawberry.Players A & B get one point each.Players A, B & C say vanilla, and player D says chocolate. Players A, B & C get one point, and player D gets the pink cow.On to the Dr Games‚Äô Criteria ‚Ä¶GO/NO GO Criterion‚Ä¢ Complexity: (GO)  This is a relatively easy game.‚Ä¢ Balanced: (GO)  The game is completely balanced.‚Ä¢ Chance: (GO)  There is an element of chance in which cards you are drawn and read.‚Ä¢ Clarity: (GO)  The rules are completely clear.‚Ä¢ Reasonable Time: (GO)  It generally takes 10-20 minutes.Bonus Criteria‚Ä¢ Social:  The game is very social, fun, and you learn a lot about the other players.‚Ä¢ Unique/Interesting Mechanics:  The awarding of the pink cow makes the game much more interesting.‚Ä¢ Informed:  You potentially learn a lot about the other players.‚Ä¢ Rewards Throughout:  Yes, once you get a point, it is yours forever."
"We saw this game while on vacation last summer.  I checked Amazon and found it and the expansion pack.  What a hoot to play with a crowd!  This is fun for all ages and I purchased two sets.  I am keeping one on hand here for when everyone is over and the other is for a family that LOVES to play games.  This brings many laughs.  The excitement when we get this out is contagious. I am looking forward to Christmas when everyone is home this year to play as a large group!  Fun game.  You won't be sorry you bought this for groups of people to play.  The ages of those who have played it are 8+ to 68.  Fun was had by all."
"Good game but not for a family of 4.  I‚Äôm thinking 6 people would make the game enjoyable. Cute game pieces. Can be played with a wide age range with general knowledge."
"Easy to play and lots of fun great for all ages"
"This game is great!  Always laughing and fun discussions at each person's turn.  I don't think I will ever get tired of playing.  It's fun to ""moo"" when someone is taking a long time to answer.  Glad I bought this game."
"Simple to learn and fun. Unlike Blank Slate, where the goal is matching your answer to just one other person‚Äôs answer, earning points in Herd Mentality is done by providing the most common answer. So your answers aren't necessarily your true opinion regarding the question; they are what you think everyone else will answer. For example, a question is ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to make eggs?‚Äù I like hard boiled eggs the best but wrote scrambled because I didn‚Äôt think anyone would even think about hard boiled (and I was right!). Anyone whose answer is in the majority gets a point, and the game ends when someone reaches 8 points, so it‚Äôs a quick little game. If only one person answers outside the majority, they get the pink cow. Play continues and points can still be collected when you have the pink cow, but you can‚Äôt win the game if the pink cow is in your possession. The only way to get rid of the pink cow is if another sole player answers outside of the majority. If more than one player gets to 8 points at the same time, play continues until one player has the most points."
"We play a lot of games and this one is definitely a really fun one to play!! I would recommend this game! The extra bonus cards help keep the fun going. Best part is looking at people."
"Cute game and easy to play. Great for younger kids since the rules are simple and can be quicker if needed."
"Such a great game to play with multiple people! Shines with a group of 6+, perfect for all ages!"
"We have grown to enjoy a few rounds of this game after dinner, right at the dinner table. Simple to set up, simple to play, easy to store. Lots of fun."
"I love playing this with my 5 y/o son. It’s easy enough, but also challenging for all ages. The magnets are very powerful and satisfying to play with. Good quality."
"Extremely strong magnets make this game so fun! Comes with a small bag for storage. I like that it can be a quick game or an ice breaker.  I always crack up as magnets decide to move and click together very quickly.  Fun game for all ages!"
"I had seen these advertised so I bought one.  It's a fun, simple game that both old and young can play.  Simple yet still challenging"
"I have played this with three year olds to 70 year olds.  Great fun!  Easy play easy to store and easy to take with you (just remember this has STRONG magnets in it so be careful where you set it!  ). Even teenagers like it. No batteries no moving parts. Perfect gift"
"Fun game for all ages.  The magnet strength is great and it’s easy to play.  Maybe too easy though.  Even our grandkids figured out early on how and where to place the magnets so they didn’t stick together.  Maybe having more magnetic stones would make it more challenging."
"Really like this game. It’s quick and fun. Plus different every time since the string can be set down any which way."
"My grandkids 6-19 loved it & even adults joined in.  Fun!"
"Perfect game for young people or us older people ! Good family time together!  Value was awesome! Love the family time we can share !"
"My kiddo loves this game! He just stared to read and spell and he finds this game fun"
"We are a family that is always looking for a new game to introduce to the youngest generation. Family game night is always filled with fun!!"
"This game is great for kids who want to learn new words and improve their spelling. It's like playing Scrabble, but designed specifically for children. It helps them build their vocabulary while having fun. They can practice spelling different words and learn how to use them in sentences. Overall, it's an excellent tool for young learners to develop their language skills in an enjoyable way."
"Fun—even for adults, but most exciting is that my son is learning to read in a fun way! Cannot recommend enough!"
"I am giving this game as a gift and haven't done so yet so I can't say if they will like it, but it seems to be of good quality."
"This is a great gift for younger kids. I would say it’s too easy for my 8 and 10 year old now.  However when they were younger it was a great intro to scrabble for them."
"Christmas gift so I won't know more until then if my grandson liked it or not"
"Purchased fir gufts forgrandchildren. Great to help with spelling."
"Good that the game can be used from a young age and grow to a more advanced level with the child."
"I have a 3 and a 7 year old... it's a dual sided game, so the first side is easy enough for my 3 year old to use. You basically just have to place letters on a board with letter spots already, so there's not a lot of thinking or planning.Flip over the board and it's more of a traditional scrabble, and my 7 year old loves it!It's a great learning tool too, especially when stuck at home with covid. Beats watching tv, ipad, movies, video games, etc.Price is right, shipping is fast, highly recommended!!"
"This board game is not of the same quality when my grandma bought the game to play with us (in the 60s-70s!) but it isn't flimsy.  Grandma played her game with all us children for over 20 years, I'd guess, with the same deck of cards.  I don't think these cards will last that long so I'm already planning to find out if I can get a replacement deck.  However, SORRY! is a terrific game and easy for children to learn to play by themselves.  I played 3-4 games with the grandchildren, teaching them the rules, and I found them playing the game by themselves when I was busy one afternoon.  It's a fun game, easy for kids to ""get"" and the cards play no favorites!  My kids are 7 and 8 but I think ones as young as six could play the game well."
"Sorry! offers the perfect blend of simplicity and strategic depth, making it an ideal choice for our family game nights. The rules are easy to grasp, ensuring that both my younger and older kids can actively participate and enjoy the fun.Apologies in Motion:Witnessing the joy on my kids' faces as they strategically played the coveted ""Sorry!"" card to send each other's pawns back to the start added an extra layer of excitement to the game. The playful rivalry and unexpected twists kept us all entertained.Family-Friendly Fun:What sets Sorry! apart is its ability to cater to a diverse age range. My two kids, with their varying interests and ages, found common ground in the thrill of racing to the finish line and hindering each other strategically. It has become a game that strengthens our family bond.Quality Components:Hasbro's commitment to quality is evident in the durable and visually appealing components of Sorry! The vibrant board, sturdy cards, and well-crafted pawns not only enhance the gaming experience but also withstand the enthusiasm of my energetic duo.Endless Replay Value:Despite its simplicity, Sorry! continues to offer endless replay value in our household. The unpredictable nature of the game and the element of chance ensure that every round brings new surprises and keeps my two kids eagerly asking for more.In conclusion, Sorry! has become a cherished classic in our family game nights, weaving together the joy of apologies, laughter, and the thrill of sweet victory. It's more than just a game; it's a shared experience that has become a treasured part of our family story. If you're looking for a timeless and engaging game to enjoy with your kids, Sorry! is a must-have for those memorable moments filled with fun and connection."
"Good family fun and a more colorful, simplified version of Parcheesi. We still play for a quick game with laughs. So I’m passing the game on as a donation that helps kids have fun with colors, counting, rule following and sportsmanship. Game boards folding into quarters makes this easy to store."
"Exactly as described. Age appropriate. Fun for the whole family. Crush proof box. Great price value for the money."
"Sorry it is a good educational game even starting at two years of age because they need to learn to count there is a little bit of popping with noise but it’s enjoyable with a child.. It’s very durable lightweight, and the speed of the dice being pushed is what you would expect."
"This is a fun game for the entire family."
"As someone who is a sucker for board games, this is and has always been my all time favorite game! Unfortunately, I lost my original copy of this game, so I was forced to buy another copy from Amazon and it came as expected - in brand new condition! Every piece, card and game board was there and untouched. If you're into ruthless, action packed, back and forth games - then this is the game for you! The max players is four, but it can be enjoyed with two players. This game never gets old!"
"I recently introduced the Hasbro Gaming Sorry! Game to my grandkids.  The rules are simple enough for the little ones to grasp, yet there’s still plenty of strategy involved, which keeps it exciting for the adults too. We love the thrill of sending each other back to start—there are always plenty of laughs and friendly competition!"
"When my niece is come over, they like to play this, so I got it for them for Christmas"
"Fantastic.  Bought it for my great grandson age 5.  My boys used to play it and their dad before them.  It was grandma's favourite game.  I used to always look out for second hand because for some reason I couldn't buy it new.  I bought second hand for both my boys.  then for my granddaughter when she was 5. So now we all have the game.  What fun and I have recommended it to others."
"Purchase on March 10, 2020Just before lockdown and really our family and friends played it throughout the lockdown without even getting bored for a moment at that we played atleast 10-12 turns daily"
"This game is easy to carry, easy to play - and very fun.Great for family trips and friends!!"
"So fun! My 5 yo great niece and 6 yo Granddaughter loved playing this at Thanksgiving! Brought lots of laughs, especially when the force of the magnets take over..lol Thinking about buying some for Christmas gifts! Easy to set up and super easy to play!"
"I saw an ad for this on social media and it looked interesting.  I found it in Amazon for less than half the price offered on social media.  Anyone of any age can play and win this game.  The pieces are highly polished and pleasant to the touch.  It is impossible to tell by appearance or shape which magnets are stronger than others so it is truly a game of chance.  A game can be very quick and entertaining with 2 or more players.  I would buy these as stocking stuffers, Hanukkah or Easter basket gifts.  The magnets and the string are easy to transport and could lend themselves easily to a child friendly game or a social drinking game and much in between!"
"I originally saw this on Instagram and  checked if Amazon had the item.  I always compare to see if price is better.  Which it was, plus I trust Amazon delivery alot more than anything on Instagram.  Anyhow,  it's  an easy game, anyone can play it and it would be great to take along on vacation or any type of trip"
"Strong magnets make it a super fun game. Great price and comes with draw string bag making it very portable."
"Bought this for my grandson to take on a trip so we’d have something to play during downtime. Great little game. Simple pieces and satisfying sounds when the magnets connect!"
"This game is really fun! The magnetic strength is just enough and fun for kids or adults needing to pass some time! Quality is great!"
"All ages enjoy this game. It’s quick. Challenging, fun and brings laughter."
"Perfect toy for a family get together. Easy to play and understand,  bright colors."
"When we go outside and go to the park we use this a lot and we're trying to play catch and learn how to throw that's why I like this it was totally worth the money."
"These are small and very cheaply made.  I would not purchase them again.  Velcro comes off and the plastic ring/rim does not stay on.  The ring/rim looks to clip on around the perimeter of the paddles."
"Does the job! Not super durable but works for what we needed it for. Can’t beat the price."
"These items literally fell apart during use! The balls started coming apart at the seams when my kids would pull it off the Velcro, then the Velcro completely pulled off of all the “mitts”!For $15 I am completely disappointed and would never buy these again!"
"My grandchildren loved them safe and great for their small hands"
"Cheap product"
"Product received in timely fashion and true to description."
"Great set to help teach little ones to throw and catch. My toddler granddaughter loves it and we've had hours of fun. Well made and durable."
"Good quality, can be used by younger children"
"The paddles are flimsy and fall apart quite quickly. Luckily you get a lot in the package so the fun will last a while. Would recommend for a bit of beach/garden fun but just treat them with respect"
"Great set for a fun game with a group of people. However the set didn't come with a bag which was a bit of a shame. I already had one here and was grateful it wasn't a gift. Brilliant game for hours of fun."
"The paddles broke after first use with the velcro ripping off when the tennis was removed."
"Excellent game and quality. As a teacher, I love how this promotes turn taking, patience, hand eye coordination, and stacking."
"Thanksgiving games…great product p,  well made, sturdy and a ton of fun for the grown up children. Lol easy take along game."
"Love it, very durable and fun to play"
"Genga is a fantastic game! It's easy to learn, fun, and full of excitement. The fast-paced gameplay keeps me coming back for more. Perfect for all ages and great for playing with friends or family. Highly recommend!"
"I had no idea that this game would make me laugh so much!  It's pure fun!  I would caution about playing with people who are high-strung as the tension can get pretty high as the pile gets wobblier.  At 72, I'm glad I got this game.  Livens things up!"
"Very fun game. Great for games night. 10/10"
"The product was light weight and durable. the game itself was engaging. Overall its a well crafted product that offers great value for price, making it must- have for any game enthusiast."
"We love to play Jenga with my grandchild. He is 5 now, so is getting better at understanding the concept, and he learns from this - which is the best part. A lot of fun, even on adult game night!"

"We did an early Christmas exchange at our Thanksgiving gather.  With 12 people with ages ranging from 13 to 75, this game was amazing.  We laughed with and at each others knowledge and mistakes.  What a wonder game to keep the family together.  Four teens actually put their phones down and asked to join the fun.I am very pleased that we selected this game to give as a gift this year."
"Bought this for a road trip over the summer. Lots of different questions, but a lot of random questions that I didn't even know the answers to.Was still fun learning new random facts."
"I got this for a trip and decided to play it once with a friend before the trip. We had a lot of fun playing this and a lot of laughs."
"Questions are great for multigenerational family fun."
"I took this to a recent family dinner. The directions are flexible - we played in teams and awarded points for each correct answer. Each team had a card and asked questions - one at a time - to the team on their left, The problem was the discrepancy in the challenge level of individual questions and cards. There are four questions on each card and we assumed they got harder from top to bottom. This was true with the first card since the last answer was a French term none of the players had ever heard before. The thought, “I should know this.” did not surface. However, the next card had no difficult questions and the following one had multiple difficult questions. It was just luck of the draw with no indication of a card’s difficulty level. This game is demoted to road trip trivia."
"fun game, family and friends enjoyed it. There’s some really funny answers as well as those answers that you say oh that’s right they must buy for family game night.!"
"Outstanding game and great for young teenagers and up.  With this game you can play by the game rules or make up your own!"
"Great little game for a weekend games day with the kids"
"It’s a fun game that made us say “I should have known that!” more times than we can count 😂Would definitely recommend buying and playing it!"
"I bought this classic version of Battleship because in the past, the electronic version always breaks too easily. This version is simple and straight forward with no electronic sounds. That way you can just sit down and play and there nothing much to break. It' also build solid, so it could last for many years!"
"Great classic game. Teaches strategy, comes with a durable case to keep everything organized. Great value for money."
"fun and packaged well"
"Our family loves this game. It’s a great travel size. The cases are durable. The numbers and letters on bottom are not very readable. The pegs sometimes fall out when the cases are bumped. They came in good condition. Over all our kids love this game with us and we really enjoy how easy it is to pack up on trips."
"Great game, both sets lock together which saves space and helps you from losing one half or the other"
"This a fine version of the classic Battleship game. It is well packaged and easy to manipulate the parts. So I can recommend this version of the game. Of course one big benefit is that there are no screens with this game. The game itself has always appealed, and fortunately it still does. Our 8 year-old grandson loves playing it- he gets so excited when he ""blows"" something up."
"This was a great gift for my grandson. We have spent hours playing this game and it comes package very well. I would definitely recommend this. Makes family night so much fun!"
"Love battleship and can’t wait to play it with my son."
"The fun, straightforward childhood game I missed so much.This updated set is better functionally than the old ones too. Being able to sit further apart and be comfortable is so nice. The way it packs up and clips together makes it very convenient for transport. All the pieces feel of decent quality and looks cool too. Still have a lot of fun playing this game and it's so easy to teach those who haven't played before.Got it for $17.09 and it's so worth it."
"Well packaged and fast delivery thanks"
"I used to play battleships when they had those black squarish boxes and the pins would fall into a crevice if not placed properly.This box set is a nice upgrade from the past, a lot slimmer with great fit for the pins and the ships. They won’t fall out easily and hold secure if you’re playing on a moving vehicle.Naturally though, I wouldn’t recommend playing on a moving vehicle because if the unsecured pins spill, good luck picking them up."
"Such a great classic game!!"
"The images on the board need to be a much higher resolution because they're a bit blurry. As for the missed opportunity for the jail (Azkaban) I understand why they didn't do it, even still would have been nice. The house points probably should've been plastic instead of cardboard since they will be handled a lot as the currency. Otherwise everything else is well made and really nice. Overall, it's a good game and definitely worth getting!"
"It did justice to the movies. Even the box is awesome. Great for play or for the collection."
"This was the best birthday gift ever for my little Harry Potter fan. It combines our love for Monopoly with our love for Hogwarts in a game that’s winnable in less than 2 hrs! Super funI played with a 5 and 8yr old. Great for the 8 yr old."
"It’s very similar to the original game. The few differences help the game move along a little quicker and actually end without hours and hours of playing. The Harry Potter theme and game pieces are a really nice touch. I will definitely play this game again without hesitation of wondering if I have the time and patience. Definitely a good buy."
"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. It came in great condition and at a  decent time. I can't wait to see her face when she opens it on Christmas. We both love harry potter. Can't wait to play it with her and the family."
"Makes it fun for a fan of Harry Potter"
"I had this in my cart for about 6 months and when it was finally available for prime delivery I ordered immediately. We collect basically every version of Monopoly in our house. Being a Potterhead made this even more special. The gold tokens must be made out of galleons! Their so fancy! Great selection of famous HP staples turned tokens, that every Potter head would appreciate! I call dibs on the Firebolt and and Buckbeak usually! The Headwig chance (owl mail) card holder is beautiful and well made! My daughter thinks it's a toy and tries to play with it when we're not playing the game! The money coins (house points) are ok. I like how they call it house points, however, it could have been made from better material. The cardboard won't last long and/or will go missing if your not mindful of them. I suggest a ziplock bag for safe keeping. The best part of the game is...the BOARD!! It feels like your actually in Hogwarts! Or maybe it's just my vivid childlike imagination taking me on a ride!! The photos are so vivid and accurate! Makes you want to buy every property!Overall, the game was worth its price tag. The game premise, tokens, board, ""free ""Headwig toy (lol) and the fact that it's Harry Potter makes it a great addition for Monopoly collectors!  I would buy this for any age HP fan!After reading this, I will point my wand at you and say""Oblivate"". Now you won't know what the game is about until you read the instructions! Enjoy!"
"The box looks Awesome!!It arrived in excellent condition!I haven’t opened it to explore more quality because it is a gift but I have an excellent feeling about this one!I highly recommend!"
"I have been waiting for a Harry Potter themed Monopoly forever and was so excited when I discovered this one! I was expecting it to be exactly like the original Monopoly with just updated property names, etc. but there are actually a few brand new features, which did not spoil the integrity of the Monopoly game as I’d feared, but turned out to enhance the game in a Harry Potter-appropriate way.There are two major things that I have found different with this version of the game. The first is that it is a much quicker game than other traditional Monopoly games. This is, I think, due to the fact that properties are purchased with House Points instead of money, and the points only come in 10s and 50s.Secondly, the Chance and Community Chest cards are now combined and are called Owl Post (including some Howlers!). With the exception of Go to Jail and Get Out of Jail Free cards, all the instructions on the Owl Post cards are different from traditional Chance and Community Chest cards but they are AWESOME and very Harry Pottery!I love this game, and highly recommend it for any Harry Potter fan!"
"Fun board game for kids who love Harry Potter.."
"We stopped playing the original monopoly after this!! Love the harry potter version.."
"My kids collect special addition Monopolies and I am so excited to play this one.  Good price and quick delivery."
"How can you go wrong with this classic masterpiece!? I love the case it comes with! Helps to keep the cards in order, not bent, easy to travel with. Fun to have the wild cards you can write your own rules on! Definitely makes for an interesting fun fmaily game night!Worth the buy I promise!"
"Great game classic for every family. Easy enough for school age kids and elderly. Cards are colorful and durable. Easy to shuffle. Great gift for the price. Highly recommend!"
"Remember when families and friends actually played board games, and card games? Instead of a living room with no conversation, just a bunch of people tapping and swiping their phones? Well getting this UNO set can help you relive some of the magic from the good old days. When everyone actually had fun and interacted with each other.Believe it or not, I forgot how to play UNO. Which is weird, considering how much I played it when I was younger. Even as a young adult. But just like riding a bike, you never really lose it. Open the tin, break out the cards and the rule sheet. And in a minute, it all came back. So easy to play, that even toddlers can participate.BONUS TIP: HOW TO GET EVEN THE SMALLEST KIDS INVOLVEDSo Mattel recommends that kids ages 7 and up can play. But any kid 4-6 can most likely grasp the basic rules, as long as they can recognize numbers. The catch is that it may not hold the attention of a five year old all that great. But there's a way that you can still put the UNO cards to good use, while enjoying some bonding time with your little ones. Here's what I figured out, after a couple of games of UNO with our Little Girl....Make it a memory game. What I did was go through the cards, and picked out two identical ones for different numbers/colors. So two green 5 cards. Two red 4 cards. Two blue 2 cards. Two yellow 7 cards. I tried to avoid sixes and nines. Basically take eight to twelve cards in total. Then place them in two to three rows, face down (UNO side up). I'd ask our Daughter to flip a card over. Yellow 7. Okay, now try to find the other Yellow 7. And she gets to flip over another card. If it's not the right one, I let her know that was a really good try. Now let's flip the cards over, and try it again. If she gets it right, I congratulate her, and she gets so excited. This way, she can play a simple game that also helps her work on her memory skills. So she can remember where certain cards were, and match them up. When she does well with six cards, I bump it up to eight cards. Then ten cards. It's simple, but fun for the smaller kids that may lose interest in actually playing UNO. And she still gets to have fun with the rest of us.There are no negatives about this set. The only thing that could have possibly been improved, is to have made the tin a tiny bit more travel-friendly. The two stacks of cards are held in plastic, inside of the tin. But it seems like they could have simply made the tin much smaller, and still fit the cards in. Making it a bit easier to just stick in your pocket. That's not a dealbreaker, just thinking out loud. Otherwise, the quality of the cards and tin are both great.Look. It's ten bucks. That's it. People spend more than that on two iced coffees, or a drive-through at a fast food place. But those are things you only get to enjoy once. Whereas you could use these cards in this tin for well over a decade. Plus you can make it a family tradition, or have fun when friends come over. It's advertised as a kid's game. But truth be told, we played it more in our dorm's game room than I ever did as a child. UNO never gets old. Why put it off? Add it to your shopping cart. You've got the ten bucks to spare, right now. Check out. It will show up at your home in as soon as a day, if you have Prime free shipping. And you can take that ten dollars, and turn it into million dollar memories with your family. But you can't do that, if you don't order it. So buy a set today, you'll be thankful you did."
"I work with children and am always engaging them with a game of Uno.  They love this new variety of Uno game.  Thank you UNO>5 Stars.  Love the tin it came in.  Fun game. I would buy this again.  Looking forward to trying a few more of the new Uno Varietys."
"Good game, easy to play"
"Always a fun game! Played by kiddos (ages 4 and 7). Great game!"
"The Mattel Games UNO Card Game has become a staple in our family game nights, and for good reason! This classic card game never fails to entertain both kids and adults alike with its simple rules and endless possibilities. Whether we're at home or traveling, UNO is our go-to game for making memories and sharing laughs.The beauty of UNO lies in its versatility. It's easy enough for young children to grasp, yet strategic and exciting for older players. The deck includes a variety of action cards that add an extra layer of excitement, keeping everyone on their toes until the very end.Additionally, the compact size of the UNO deck makes it perfect for taking on the go. Whether it's a road trip, a plane ride, or a weekend getaway, UNO is always packed and ready to entertain. Plus, it makes for a fantastic gift for kids of all ages, ensuring hours of fun for the whole family."
"Hands down the best version of UNO we have played to date.. I Highly recommend. This makes the version changes the strategy & makes the game significantly more fun. Only possible improvement would be to make a waterproof version for poolside usage."
"I bought these for Father's Day for my dad (75). He's not colourblind, but both of my parents have trouble distinguishing colour in low-light, which we often have if we play during the evenings at the lake. It's also nice for them to have the tin, as it's a lot easier for them to put away compared to the cardboard case we have at home.The only complaint, and it's minor, is the 6 and 9 are a little more difficult to distinguish compared to the other deck we have at home. Still takes dad a bit of getting used to. But again, a very minor issue, and I would still fully recommend."
"I already owned this version of Uno, so I bought this one for someone else, who had liked mine.  Mine is in a regular box, but I wish all card games would be released in tins, as they are more durable.  The tin wasnâ€™t available when I bought my own game.My friend is happy with the game and it being in a tin is a bonus to him!ðŸŽ‰"
"Combining dodgeball with a card game is a brilliant idea, and it’s a lot of fun to play with friends and family. The rules are easy to understand, and the game is highly engaging. Highly recommend for game nights."
"Exploding kittens makes the best games! This one is super active and so much fun!"
"Fun active game. Our children love the action of throwing the soft burritos. Even when thrown what would seem hard, still doesn't cause any physical discomfort. With adults its the same and you can make it a drinking game to add to the adult fun if you choose to. Great for family/friends game night."
"I didn’t know I’d be scrubbing blood out of the living room carpet on Christmas Day at 10:30p.m., but there I was, having to decide whether I pull out cleaning solution or if I just call it a night and go to bed. It’s all still a bit of a blur, but for proper context, allow me to start from the beginning.My teenage sister loves family board games, and Exploding Kittens is a favorite of hers. She’s mentioned a few times this year that she really, really wanted to try Throw Throw Burrito. Being the amazing older sister that I am, I added this to my Amazon cart and had it shipped to me to wrap for her to open Christmas morning. Did I do my research? No, this is where I made a grave mistake, but more on that later. When my sister tore the paper on Christmas morning to find this long-awaited game, thrilled shouts rang out around the room from fellow family members who looked forward to playing. The pride of a great gift given washed over me in this moment, and I took another sip of hot coffee, happy with the successful purchase. Looking back to that moment, I now see just how naive I was.After Christmas dinner had been eaten and the rest of dessert polished off, 6 of us gathered in the living room and sat down in a big circle on the floor to play Throw Throw Burrito. As I was reading the instructions, I grew concerned. Even though the name is “Throw Throw Burrito,” somehow I thought it would be more like “Toss Toss Burrito.” I swallowed my concern and we dealt everyone in. The game starts and we’re getting the hang of it and it’s a little aggressive...and then someone called a duel. I don’t remember who or how I ended up standing back-to-back with my younger brother who is a head taller and twice my size, but next thing I knew someone yelled “3...2...1... Burrito!” and I was no longer in the living room. Adrenaline surged through my veins and I was on a battlefield. I tried to dodge a burrito and chuck one all at the same time, and we both missed. Glass bulbs clanged on the Christmas tree, other players shouted from the sidelines, and I scrambled to find a burrito on the floor before my brother could get the other and hit me with it. Only thing is—I couldn’t find it. It was lost to me forever, so I had one option: run. I ran faster than I’ve ever run in my adult life as this grown, built-like-bull beast of a man chased me around the living room, nearly causing an earthquake to rupture across the American Midwest. I had nowhere to turn but to keep running around the room before he could hit me. This is where things start to get fuzzy, because my heart is racing and I’m running for my EVER. LOVING. LIFE. Suddenly, my foot slides against a game card and I fly, falling face-down into the carpet. I lie there for a second trying to process all that just transpired when I feel the harrowing finality of a burrito hitting me in the back. The competitive screams turn to silence, and someone says, “Uh, you ok?”I carefully pick myself—and my pride—up off the floor. We all make our way back into the circle, the game we once played long gone, scattered in a disarray across the room. Some announced how this was the most fun they’d ever had during a card game, and still reconciling in my mind what just occurred, I let them know that no one could ever convince me to play this awful game again.My sister rolled her eyes and we straightened the cards best we could to get back to the round at hand. I feel my foot throbbing and I look down, only to see blood running down the side of it. I’m not sure at what point I was injured during my burrito civil war, but there was a gash on my foot. “I’m bleeding!” I exclaim, and my fellow players just start laughing. We finished the game around 10:30 in the evening, and I left to properly bandage my foot. I come back and as we’re putting the game away I see a blood stain in the white carpet where I had fallen just minutes prior. The big question now was, do I scrub the blood out of my mother’s white carpet, or just call it a night? Who knew this is how the Christmas of 2020 would draw to a close?All that being said, buyer beware: this is no game of “Toss Toss Burrito.” This, indeed, is “Throw Throw Burrito,” and may bring out a new side you’ve never seen before of the people you play with. And, bad mood and wounded pride aside, it was actually pretty fun. We played it again last night and while bulbs clanged against the Christmas tree again, no one was majorly injured. The burritos are already cracked and one is missing a chunk, so I don’t think they’ll last very long, but Throw Throw Burrito is quite the entertaining game nonetheless.All I can say now, fellow potential purchaser, is good luck."
"Very fun and chaotic for the whole family."
"Really nothing wrong with a game that involves dueling burritos. Just fun and easy to understand."
"The game is fun, it is fast-paced, and it was a really good therapy tool for my kid with selective mutism as it encourages verbal interaction in a fun setting. Younger kids can play alongside older kids and adults. Great game!"
"We're hosting an extended family game night next week and I wanted something new & different to play that everyone would enjoy. Our family loves rummy, PIT! and other card games so I figured I'd give 'Throw Throw Burrito' a try, even though we've never played or purchased 'Exploding Kittens' or any other of their games. And also even though someone in my family tends to injure themselves every single time we all get together.Yesterday when this arrived, my husband and I sat down to learn how to play so that we can teach everyone else on game night. It is easy to learn and appropriate for all ages. It was great fun playing this, even with just two people, and it'd be a lot more fun with a bigger group.So I matched the 'Burrito War' cards which means everyone grabs for a burrito and throw it at another player. I whipped a burrito at my husband's chest except it accidentally hit him in the face because 1) I have terrible (or great?) aim and 2) we were sitting at very close range to each other.Consequently, he informed me that 'we' are not allowed to play this game anymore. When he said 'we' I knew he meant me. I am not allowed to play because I cannot be trusted to not hit him in the face with a squishy burrito. He hid the box but I know where and I am totally breaking this out on family game night!"
"My son is 9 and this is the game he always wants to play on game night.  It's an easy game to learn and lots of kids/people can play at the same time.  Only thing is, play somewhere where you won't be afraid something may be knocked over by a flying burrito!  Good game for birthday parties too."
"This is basically the card game Spoons, but more extravagant and crazy and we love it! Takes a while to inflate and deflate and the burritos are pretty big, but we'll worth it! Easy for young children to learn and play."
"This board game is alot of fun, all parts came intact and it's very vibrant!"
"My son is turning 8 and we tried playing Monopoly for a few hours before he completely lost interest. I bought this game in hopes of a lighter experience and it was everything I remembered. It took about an hour and a half to get through to the end but it was eventful and kept his attention. I like the updated career cards. We have already played it twice!"
"I bought this game for my daughter for her birthday and our family had a fun time playing together. There are some rules I don't remember having when I played this back in the 90's, and those changes actually make the game more fun.  We enjoyed the updates and got a lot of good laughs out of how ""Life"" turned out for each of us.I do wish it had a couple more cars, so that more people could play. We are a family of 5, so we opted to have one family member just do the ""bank"" job while we played together, but it would be even better if I could purchase extra cars and ""people"" for the game."
"Tried to duplicate the old game of life. It’s a good game with modern twist but wish it was just like the original I remember!"
"Was really impressed with the packaging. Game arrived in perfect condition. This is a favorite game and we love to gift it to friends."
"Love it"
"the game is easy for the kids to pickup and learn, best part is all the features allow for quick setup and allow them to learn about the purpose of life. It allows us to have lots of family time and with the roles they can explore different career paths. One of the more purposeful games that never gets old. Also a great gift for anybody 5 or above."
"Easy to play"
"Just what my nephew wanted. He loves it. Fast delivery, product is great too. Thank you"
"The right amount of learning curve to just have fun and not get bored or frustrated.  The art is beautiful, and it was interesting reading information on all of the parks."
"I LOVE this game.  It is well made, fun and different than your typical board game.  I even learned a few things about our national parks.  The game tokens are nicely made and worth the money.  It took a little time to run through all the rules, which my teenage niece read through them for us, but once that is done, it's fun and challenging!"
"Received Trekking The National Parks board game as a Christmas gift from my husband, and it has been a lot of fun.As National Park lovers, this board game has quickly become a favorite in our household. The combination of fast-paced gameplay, strategic elements, and the educational aspect of learning about national parks resonates well with us, as we are real-life park fans ourselves. Also, cool to see the inspiration behind the game.We've played it with adult family members (ages 20 to 54) and it has been a blast. The game is easy to learn, ensuring everyone can dive into the adventure without unnecessary complexities. The fact that it's suitable for kids aged 10 and up makes it a versatile choice for family game nights.What's truly impressive is that despite its simplicity, the game doesn't lose its charm. We haven't grown tired of it, and each playthrough offers a unique experience as we explore different national parks.Highly recommended for those who enjoy a quick, engaging, and educational board game experience. It has been a great addition to the game collection and a good substitute for Catan if you like that game and want to switch things up!"
"This game is fun for adults and kids.  It does take about an hour to play, it depends on the strategy you use.  It was given as a gift, and was enjoyed by everyone.  I would recommend this game, and would buy it again as a gift or for myself."
"My wife likes it but there is just too many way to gain points and it's kinda annoying at the end who won but overall game design is great and fun to learn about all national parks."
"I gave this to my parents because they love traveling to national parks. They love it! It's so fun, we love that there are so many ways you can try to play it, like methods to win - you can focus on beads, parks, campsites, blocking people XD The best way is typically a mix of all the things, you have to really multitask and be flexible based on what everyone else is doing.It's a high quality game, fun and beautiful board and cards and pieces, and I love the information! The cards have details about the different parks. It really makes you want to go visit them! Gives my parents ideas for which they want to see next, or again! So fun to play it with them, really good for people who are outdoorsy and enjoy going to places like that."
"This was fun to play and learned a lot along the trails."
"Love this game! Fun for the whole family and very high quality workmanship."
"Nice quality board and accessories, and an engaging, educational array of national park information on the cards.  Our first game took longer than usual as we were learning.  We plan to watch the video on game play to make sure we have interpreted the instructions correctly, but it's a good game.  I think many board games are too expensive though, including this one, but the quality is there."
"This game is really fun for 2 people (probably for more as well but so far just me and my partner). It's easy to get a hold of the rules and it's fun competition. The game ends quite quickly when people collect 5 National parks, so to make it more fun me and my partner remove this rule and play until all stones are collected."
"Fantastic service and great product."
"My kids all love Pictionary and it‚Äôs such a great family time game! Easy enough for my 12 yo to know what most of the items are and fun for the adults too!"
"Fun classic for the family. Can be tough to find a pop topic card relevant enough for younger players but still great fun."
"I love the game, but find the boards that come with it too tiny - would prefer a bigger board and an easel, as it used to be"
"Like many reviews say, the game is great, easy and fun to play for my 10 and 7 year olds, but the markers are an absolute mess. We had wet baby wipes with us and we still all ended up with dark stains in our hands that won‚Äôt go away after washing and scrubbing. I‚Äôm just hoping it won‚Äôt transfer to the bedsheets at the night due to body heat. I‚Äôm getting regular whit board markers with a dry eraser next time we play. Or paper and pencil. Whichever."
"This is a great game"
"Made of good quality, and a fun game"
"Loved this game as a kid had friends over they were reluctant at first then had so much fun the insist on us bringing it to our next dinner!"
"Great game. Quality of markers and board are not great.Like many reviews say, the game is great, easy and fun to play with kids, but the markers are an absolute mess. We had wet baby wipes with us and we still all ended up with dark stains in our hands that won‚Äôt go away after washing and scrubbing.  I‚Äôm getting regular whit board markers with a dry eraser next time we play. Or paper and pencil. The marker is tough to come off skin."
"Bought it as a game to play with my elderly grandpa and we have so much fun."
"Good quality"
"I'd forgotten how much fun this game is. We played with an 8 year old, 11 year old, 41 year old and a 68 year old and everyone had a great time! üòÅ The reusable cards and markers are a good idea, but very clumsy to actually use, particularly cleaning them each time. Many of the clues are unnecessarily abstract, but we just skipped those."
"ALL IS GOOD"
"I shopped  around and this was well priced! Came in less than 24 hours!!"
"Very quick to learn and quick to play, but takes some serious observation of what you can do and what your opponents have done to develop a (flexible) winning strategy. Good for both beginners and experienced gamers, and shouldn't take more than 30-40 minutes to play.I recommend getting sleeves for the cards (2.5""x3.5"" ""poker"" sized) because they will get used a lot. I'm not a big fan of the chips, but most people seem to like them and they are certainly much better than the cardboard chits you would have expected to get with most boardgames.The artwork is nice, but the theme feels pasted on. They could have made this with no artwork at all and it would have played exactly the same (and been just as much fun).The mechanics are relatively simple: you have a tableau of cards laid out, 4 each from 3 different decks. The cards from the I deck are the cheapest to buy and the least valuable, worth 0 or 1 point for victory; the cards from the II deck cost more and are worth 1-3 points; and the cards from the III deck are the most expensive to buy and the most valuable, worth 3-5 points each. Cards you purchase are played face up in front of you and give you a permanent discount thereafter, so purchasing a white diamond card (for example) gives you a permanent discount of 1 white for all future purchases. The price of a card is in the lower left, and cards are purchased with any combination of the right color cards and gem tokens. Thus, if a card costs 5 green to purchase, you could purchase it with 5 green tokens, the discount from 5 previously purchased green cards, 3 tokens and the discount from 2 previously purchased cards, etc. A gold joker token is ""wild"" and can be used in place of any color in the price on a one-to-one basis, so in the above example you could buy the card with 2 green gem tokens, discount from 2 previously purchased green cards, and a gold joker token.Purchased cards are replaced immediately from the appropriate deck, and gem tokens used to purchase a card are returned immediately to the supply/bank.If you purchase cards of the appropriate colors, either 4 each of 2 specific colors or 3 each of 3 specific colors, you get a ""visit"" from a ""noble."" This simply means you collect the appropriate noble tile. Nobles are worth 3 points each.On each turn, you take one of three actions: purchase a card that is face up or that you have previously reserved; reserve a card to your hand so that only you may purchase it on a later turn; or collect gem tokens. You may only reserve a card up to a total of 3 in hand, and the only way to clear a reserved card out of your hand is to purchase it on a later turn. If there are any gold jokers available, you get one when you reserve a card; this is the only way to get a gold joker token. To collect gem tokens, you may take 2 of a same color if at least 2 of that color would be left in the supply after you take yours (at least 4 present before you take your 2), or you can take 1 each of 3 different colors. If you have more than 10 tokens (gems and jokers) at the end of your turn, you must immediately discard down to 10 total. (There are a few edge cases to read up on, but that's the basic gameplay.)The game is played until at least 1 player reaches 15 points. When that happens, the current round is finished out so that everyone has had an equal number of turns, then the player with the most points wins. In a tie, whomever purchased the fewest cards wins the tiebreaker.The strategy lies in planning out how to get the cards and/or tokens you need for future purchases, identifying the cards your opponent is hoping to purchase, and controlling the very limited supply of tokens and visible cards by buying/collecting/reserving what your opponent wants or needs. You cannot directly attack an opponent; once a card is purchased, she has it permanently; once she collects gem tokens, she has them until she chooses to spend them. It is all a matter of forward thinking, preparing for your future card purchases and impeding or obstructing your opponent's intended future card purchases.The deck III cards have a uniform distribution of costs and values among the 5 card colors; the deck II and I cards do not.It's simple to understand, quick to set up, quick to play, fun to look at, fun to handle the tokens (chips), and most importantly, fun to play. The only random element is shuffling the 3 decks and the nobles before set up; it's basically all decisions after that.Bottom line: does it play well? Yes it does. Can you teach and play quickly? Yes you can. Will it still be as fun on the 50th play? Yes it will (is). Does it give good value for your entertainment dollar? Yes it does. Some people have called it a ""filler"" game, which is a special term among gamers meaning you can set up and play fairly quickly, without major strategy time/planning required, and still have fun. I also like to describe it as a ""gateway"" game, which means it can draw people who who usually don't think of themselves as gamers into the scene. It hits that sweet spot of affordable, quick, fun, non-cutthroat, with meaningful decisions, for many people.Edit: I personally don't like the tokens. They are better than the cardboard you would usually expect in a boardgame, but I find it's a little more fun for us to use ""pirate"" coins Pirate Dubloons, Set of 5 Replica Coins for the gold joker tokens, and acrylic ""pirate"" gems Jumbo Adhesive Jewels (100 pc) for the gem tokens. I am not 100% satisfied with the acrylic gems for this purpose, but the coins are perfect."
"splendor is a fun easy to learn family game.  The game time is about 30 to 45 minutes.  This is an engine builder game where each player increases their wealth in a strategy to purchase cards that win the game.  Everything about this game is high-quality, including the game board the texture feel and density of the tokens the cards have amazing art and durable, as well as the box and storage compartments that come with it.  We played this game with people ranging from nine years old to 50 years old and all have an equal chance of winning played right.  The game is easy to set up. The instructions are clearly labeled and easy to follow."
"We know this game is very highly recommended game in the world, still this is very fantastic game more than we thought.It needs strategy but not so difficult - so we think we can enjoy this game for a long time.We also ordered 2 more games, and all products came to us without any harms.Thank you!"
"My kids love this game and I don't hate playing it with them! Game takes about half hour, pieces are good quality. It says for ages 10 and up but my smart 7 year old plays perfectly well and wins also. Great game, enjoyed by all."
"This game is so fun and simple to learn and play. It can be set up in about a minute or less and has everything you need to play. A 2 player game can go as quick as 10-15 minutes. For 3 and 4 player games I would add at least 5-7 minutes per player. The game is easy to play but there's enough strategy to make it very interesting. You need to pay attention to what the other players are buying and what they possess, as all items and values must be shown at all times. There's no interaction between players, but you can try to reserve or buy cards that will restrict other players' options.There are 5 different gem tokens that are used, which have printed graphics on a thick plastic chip, and a 6th, a ""joker"" that is a wildcard that can substitute for the other 5 colors of gems. On your turn you can select a certain number of gems to take, reserve a card from the table to buy later (which also gives you 1 joker token), or buy a card using the gems in your possession. The cards give you bonuses to your gem counts, so if you buy a card with a ruby bonus, you can add that to your total of ruby gem tokens you have. This makes buying future cards that require rubies easier to buy. Some of the cards have prestige (victory) points, which are needed to win the game. There are also 3 nobles who will visit you if you have the required gem bonuses in your collection, which will give you more prestige points. When a player reaches 15 prestige points, the current round is completed so that every player gets an equal number of turns. At the end of this final round, the player with the most prestige points wins.The plastic insert keeps everything in it's place and neatly stored. The 3 levels of development cards and the tokens have their own slots to help with organization and setup. There are suggested rules for 2 players and 3-4 players. The art is on each piece is excellent, and helps with the theme. The box, cards, gem tokens, and noble tiles are all high quality. The noble tiles are printed on thick cardboard and the development cards aren't very textured but not flimsy.This game can also appeal to non-gamers due to the simple rules and quick play time."
"Great game, Quick to learn, sturdy component construction."
"This is the best game we've found in years. We've given it to several other families and they all love it too. It's just really flexible and accessible.It's easy and fairly quick to set up. Each game is not super long. It works well with 2, 3 or 4 players. It's not overly complicated so it's fun for casual game players but it has enough strategy to keep more focused people entertained."
"We love this game. The playing tokens have some weight to them, they're nice."
"arrived good condition, but it is the old version, not 2024 version.  ordered as gift in South Africa"
"Terrible quality of materials, the cards and chips are made of cheap and thin paper.But it's enough to play neatly"
"We love this game!  The game takes about 30 minutes to play, which is perfect for maintaining interest. It is a game of luck and strategy. Our grandchildren (aged 9 to 11) can play - and win - so it can be enjoyed by the whole family. It is easy to play but once you have played it a few times, you begin to develop diabolical strategies to beat your opponents.  Beware, as it can become addictive and it can leave you seething with resentment when your opponent snatches victory just as you thought you had it in the bag!"
"At first I was scared if it would be a good product or duplicate but then I ordered and now I m well satisfied and its really so much fun to play with frnds,and it can be played up to 4 from two to players!totally recommend it"
"Great game and well made for the price. Fun for family and teens! Easily stored."
"We did played this for family game night with a group of friends and boy did it become competitive!  And hilarious!  Also played it with coworkers during our annual onsite meeting.  Great game to get people involved!"
"Very fun game! Definitely need to be somewhat sober to play otherwise it gets confusing!Easy to understand the rules tho!"
"This was a hit at game night! Instructions were quick and we were able to play immediately. Games go pretty fast. Using two teams was perfect. One team does the challenge while the other team listens for rules being broken. It was just as fun being the listening team. The phrases in game play ranged from easy to impossible so there was a good blend. Lots of laughs throughout!"
"Such a fun game.  Played it for our girl’s night, eight of us.  Had a blast."
"Lots of good laughs"
"We LOVE this game!! We played it for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was so much fun!! We are all very competitive and this game got pretty intense so it was perfect for us!! The instructions were clear and we were able to get to playing pretty quickly. I highly recommend this game for any family looking for a good laugh!!"
"We had fun playing this game!!"
"Delivered efficiently and in good condition."
"It’s a great and funny game. I love it and best for family gatherings"
"This game is SO MUCH FUN.  Family favorite by far.  Only down side is you run out of your guessing cards very quickly then it just becomes repetitive which can take the fun out of it.  So far I  can’t find any refills for the game, but it’s not hard to make up your own words either."
"Got the game, it was previously opened though. Hope all the pieces are here"
"We bought it for our granddaughter and it's been non-stop giggles ever since. The way it mimics your voice in that silly high-pitched tone is just hilarious, and the dancing? Forget about it. It's got some seriously groovy moves. The built-in songs are a cute touch, though I admit we mostly use the recording feature to make it repeat our own silly phrases. The LED lights add a fun, party vibe, especially in the dark. It's a bit loud, but hey, that's part of the charm!Honestly, this thing is worth every penny for the entertainment value alone. It's sturdy, the battery life is decent, and it's held up well to some enthusiastic toddler play. If you're looking for a fun, interactive toy that'll keep your little one (and let's be honest, the adults too) entertained, look no further than this dancing, talking cactus. It's a guaranteed hit!"
"This is a really fun toy for my 6 month old, it is a cute green color, the music quality on it is really good, easy to use, and it stands up on its own pretty well. Would make a great gift."
"What a great toy.  It listens and repeats whatever you're saying.  Kids will love it!  Heck, I love it.  It's easy to use & operate.  Great value.  Great for kids under 3 years old!!"
"Anyone else find it hilarious that the pre-programmed songs are obviously all stolen? Like it plays current and past pop hits, and some are remixed, but you can tell what the original is haha also, I will not be leaving my child unattended with this‚Äîit‚Äôs jerky and the fabric twists weird when it‚Äôs in use, so probably some hazards there. Otherwise, fun/gimicky toy to play with."
"But the sound is very bad quality and it speaks spanish???"
"This is good for young children. It helps the learn and hear themselves talk. They are fascinated by it. My son talks to it every second, my daughter follows too. Good buy. No regrets"
"She loves it now and laughs. It is way too loud and annoying"
"It worked for a couple hours and then stopped. With brand new batteries. It would turn on but I couldn‚Äôt even get it to play the music it came with. It could barely pick up my voice when it did work, unless I was practically yelling 6 inches from it. I regret buying it. It wasn‚Äôt working nearly as well as videos portrayed it to, even when it was actually ‚Äúworking‚Äù.Update: After I had posted my original review, the seller reached out to me and offered to replace it. I figured why not? I‚Äôd give it one more chance, and if the second one didn‚Äôt work I was completely done. Well, they replaced it and it showed up pretty quickly. The new one works perfectly! The kids absolutely love this thing. I would say it‚Äôs definitely worth it when it works properly!"
"And SO darn annoying lol. Good thing it was a gift and I don't have to live with it. Works very well and picks up everything and repeats so careful if you're a grandma with a trucker mouth. Grandson loved it!"
"My daughter loved it when she opened it up for Christmas but after 1 week it stopped working.Thank you for sending a new one, it's perfect no issues. Excellent customer service."
"Was a hit at the Birthday Party all the kids/adults loved it. But annoying after a while."
"I find the music too loud and it cannot be adjusted."
"The kid loves it! Very entertaining and good quality. I only wish the toy sound was a bit louder."
"This is a really cute toy. My one year old got it for his birthday and he loves it. He has spent a lot of time playing with it and continues to go back for more playtime. It’s great quality and a great value. I was worried it would be noisy but the noises it makes are easy to listen to without making you want to turn it right back off! Great for motor skills. Easy for a baby to use and seems like a safe toy. The drumsticks have been chewed on and the tops don’t come off and seem to help with gum/teething pain as well"
"We bought this drum set as a gift for a friend’s 1-year-old, and it was an instant success! He absolutely loves it and can’t stop drumming. It’s the perfect size for little hands, and the bright colors and fun sounds keep him entertained.The set is sturdy and well-made, perfect for a curious and active toddler. It’s also a great way to encourage creativity and motor skills. Seeing how much he enjoys it has been so rewarding—this was definitely a great gift choice! Highly recommend for any little music lover!"
"This is smaller than I expected but it’s a nice toy."
"I bought this drum set for my 3-year-old godson and he loves it! He plays with it every day and enjoys making different sounds and rhythms. The drum set is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It comes with four modes: free play, letters, numbers, and follow along. The free play mode lets him bang on the drums as he likes, the letters and numbers mode teaches him the basics of music and math, and the follow along mode challenges him to copy the patterns of lights and sounds. The drum set is also very colorful and attractive. It has three drum pads, a cymbal, and two drumsticks. The volume is adjustable and the sound quality is good. I think this is a great toy for kids who love music and want to develop their motor skills and creativity. I highly recommend it!"
"Good size for lil hand"
"I bought this for my child's first birthday, he's madly in love with these drums.  The noise adjustes for higher or lower sounds, the durability is amazing also. I would recommend this for younger kids. 😄"
"My 2 year old daughter loves this. Makes a ton of noice and keeps her busy."
"Bought this for my 1 year old daughter, and it was easily her favourite Christmas gift, and is probably the toy she has taken to the best so far of anything we've tried.The sticks are padded at the head, so their relentless banging shouldn't worry you about anything breaking.It's simple to set up, simple to use, and you'll love watching your kid rock out on this. It is quite small, so I really would only suggest it for kids up to 2 or 3.Also, as far as I can tell, there is no volume control option on the toy, but the default volume is a very reasonable level, so I couldn't see it bothering even those with noise sensitivities."
"This is great for a 2 year old"
"Kids love it. Not too loud so it doesn’t annoy anyone!"
"I recommend this toy for a few reasons. One it’s fun, plain and simple, easy to use, figure out, and assemble. Two it’s a good price and the colors for the hair are neat. Last, I bought this for the classroom I work in (elementary K-3 students on the spectrum) and they love it. Each student has their own way they like to use it but it is fun, easy to show how to use and it has helped really well with hand eye coordination when using the scissors to cut the hair or putting playdoh in the hairdryer and using the push tool, making the Mohawks or glasses. All around not only do the kids enjoy it but it’s a neat toy and does not take up a lot of space. Makes a clicking noise when the playdoh is pushed all the way to the top so you know when to add more or cut. The center piece where you put the playdoh will come out when it is fully extended up and that helps cleaning the extra playdoh on the sides and underneath off. I recommend."
"The commercial for this kept coming up during paw patrol and I caved and got it. No regrets, it's super cute and fun. My 10 and 4 year old boys fight over it. The scissors are a little flimsy but the other accessories are a great. Just read the instructions before loading play doh or it's a pain to get out from the head."
"This is the cutest little play doh set for my toddler. She has been trying to learn how to use scissors and this is a safe way to help teach her. We have had lots of fun at an affordable price, which is great for these cold indoor days."
"I bought this for my girlfriend’s granddaughter.  She is 3 and her mother is a hairdresser.  She loved this, played with it for hours on Thanksgiving and took it home and continued playing with it.  It did not clean easily, as I kept trying to scrape the plastic pieces off.  It was a real mess that got in the carpet.  But the little girl loved it!"
"Cute set. My granddaughter will love it"
"exactly what I was looking for. Can't go wrong with play doh ever kids always love it."
"Christmas gift"
"The instructions were practically non-existent. Just a bunch of numbered pictures that didn't show the plunger until the end. The turn crank was very difficult to get on. Very disappointing. My granddaughter did like it, once it was put together. I would not buy this again, and don't recommend it."
"Very cute little set however way too expensive. My granddaughter does love it though so she’s happy."
"Bought this for my granddaughters Christmas present. She loves playdo. Lots of uses. Great size. Good price."
"A lot of fun!"
"My grandsons play with these things for hours, creating new paths and layouts. The size of this set allows for so many configurations that they keep their mind active without getting bored. Their only disappointment is when we tell them it's time to stop! We knew they'd love this set, but didn't realize how much. Well made, colorful and just plain fun! I even enjoy coming up with ideas."
"Someone gave us a flimsy plastic marble maze. It didn’t work. Marbles kept getting stuck. Our 3 year old daughter was so disappointed. I ordered this. The fun hasn’t stopped. I ordered the smaller set not knowing how interested she’d be. We’ve played with it every day in both a dark bedroom with the shades drawn and out in a well lit room. We are all obsessed. The small set works for us now, but I see us ordering more in the future. The glow marbles work well. Completely worth it!"
"Congratulations!  You’ve arrived at the Cadillac of marble runs. After buying some other difficult to assemble and component limited competitors, I’ve decided this kit is tons of fun and way better for kids’ attention span.After opening this set up my daughter and I got to work making towers of exciting marble runs.No need for instructions, most pieces you’ll figure out, and then for the pieces that look weird your wife will read the instructions and explain it to you later! The pieces are simple and connect easily, and you’ll fight your children for the “cool” pieces.There are lots of support pieces and several unique pinwheel, looping, spiraling pieces. Some pieces branch in different directions so you can build multipath runs that go in different directions.Yeah some of the connections maybe get a little unstable (there’s actually descent support bases) but we’re talking about building a marble run towers taller than my 6 year old.  If it falls and crashes who cares, just rebuild a new one! They’ll only cry temporarily and you can re-acquire the “cool” pieces your kids wouldn’t share after the crash and barter them back for promises of baths and chores.The marbles are glow in the dark.  My wife informed me of this on day 2.  So build your tower at dusk and then prepare for the spectacular marble light show extravaganza.In all honesty, this is a great set.  Lots of pieces, peak interest in creativity, and I especially appreciate there were no published designs.  It forced us to be creative and design our own runs."
"Fun, but the marbles are just clear glass and are extremely easy to lose for kids."
"*Updated: The more we play, the more frustrating this set is because the pieces like to fall apart very easily if you’re not great at creating a stable creation which results in a frustrated mom and boy. Keep that in mind if you’re child wants to do it independently and is also new to marble runs.That aside, it’s fun. I just wish the small set had more pieces, especially bases to keep it stable to be able to create different designs.*_______So I gave this a 5 star because although it didn’t make me feel like it’s amazing, it’s great for the price and quality.Our son loved it this morning during Christmas. My husband and him built a few drops.Pros: easy to use, marbles are pretty, the light and glow in the dark feature was a hit, and you can achieve a few different drops with the amount you have.Cons:This isn’t the most sturdiest set, seems to be easy to snap if you have an energetic child like ours so be careful, and wish they have come out with an expansion by now.Over all this is fun and the kid loves it!"
"Closest thing I could find to classic MARBLEWORKS quality wise. Nephew loves them! A little pricey for number of pieces, but all the ones I found cheaper were horrible quality."
"I have purchased this item twice as a gift for children aged 7 to 9 years old. It’s been a hit each time! It is sturdy and well-made of quality material. It encourages creativity and thinking outside of the box and provides hours of entertainment for either one child or multiple children at one time. I like that it is available in a few different sizes so that you can purchase according to size availability in the home, which is a plus. I enjoy giving gifts that fall into the STEM categories for children, and this one qualifies!"
"I bought this fur my 8 year old son. He loves to build things. He loves it and plays with it for hours. I wish I came with a few more marbles. It's sturdy and can be made into so many different configurations."
"Sturdy, easy to build, and lots of fun for the kiddos. Happy with our purchase."
"Ever since I bought this item for my child, he never stopped playing with it. We designed dozens of labyrinths and he really likes experimenting with the different possibilities of the marbles sliding down through the maze."
"I chose this over cheaper ones that did look very similar and really feel like it was worth the money. I bought the bigger 250 one for my 9 year old's birthday. My 12 year old daughter loves it just as much, so does my husband. Huge hit!"
"My five year old daughter loved this makeup kit!  It was adorable and you get a lot for the price. Will purchase again!"
"My niece LOVED this! Definitely her FAVORITE gift! Goes everywhere she goes! It's so adorable and the accessories were definitely age appropriate!"
"Everything seems to be good quality from what I have examined The unicorn is adorable and everything comes nicely wrapped inside of the unicorn makeup bag. This would be a great gift for a young kid that likes makeup and unicorns."
"Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Enjoys the items inside the bag. The bag is cute but not that big."
"I panicked after I ordered thinking I made mistake getting it because of the clean up or staining but it came off super easy. Even off wallsðŸ¥²"
"This is perfect for a little girl that wants to play dress up. Much better quality than I expected for the price. A great value and gift"
"This arrived just as advertised. Great quality bag with lots of make up. Our three year old granddaughter is going to love it!"
"My four year old daughter loves the makeup and the purse is durable. The brushes are soft and itâ€™s overall cute."
"Cute simple set that makes it perfect for younger kids. It doesn't have a ton of accessories so perfect for imaginative kiddos who don't need all of that. Good quality and decent value. Since it's small it's easy to put together and play."
"Cutest little beginner Lego set! Interactive which is so fun for the kiddos!"
"4 year old loved this gift.  Easy to put together and actually fires."
"This is a reasonably priced Spiderman toy that is perfect for his little fans. My 3 yr old grandson was thrilled to see this when he opened the gift bag."
"It's cheap and cute. I got this for my boyfriend and he was happy with it. easy to build and it's cute and tiny"
"Fun to build. Love the finished piece"
"My son loves superhero‚Äôs but mostly Spider-Man. He recently has gotten into legos. So these were perfect! I have to build them because he is three and doesn‚Äôt understand that part yet. But if you know anything about legos brand they have amazing instructions. Easy to understand and amazing quality! I really enjoy building any legos. I have flower sets of my own. These hold up even to my son dropping them and smashing them. Every now and then I have to fix a piece but this is a sturdy set."
"Lego doesn't disappointment.  This age appropriate spiderman Lego kit provided accurate directions to assemble the vehicle.  The pieces were easy to sort and snapped in with ease.  This item allows for time together with your child or grandchild boosting self esteem and confidence in learning.  Learning, life skills and fun were combined for the best results.  Loved it!  Would purchase additional like items."
"As advertised. Nice set"
"I got this for my 10 year old.You get what you pay for. In the end, was worth the money for my kids.The instructions ARE NOT HELPFUL! So if you need clear instructions, don‚Äôt get it. We literally just went based off of the picture on the box. Took a couple pieces apart and retried a few times. However, all in all it took probably about 20ish minutes. No tools needed. It is a little flimsy. So if you are buying this for a toddler who climbs.. well don‚Äôt.Note: this is too small for my 4‚Äô11 10 year old. However, we got it because we live in an apartment and it‚Äôs just not reasonable for him to be dunking on his door all day (so less noise). He likes it though. His 4 year old sister LOVES it, and it‚Äôs the perfect height for her. So I would say this is more so for 4-6 years old. If you‚Äôre looking for a cheaper , temporary, small space verified or kinda toddler friendly version then this is your best bet."
"my 5-year-old got this for a Birthday present, and he loves it! very easy to set up, he even got to help. It is lightweight very easy to move around if you need to change the location, but sturdy. Comes with 4 balls and pump to inflate them as well. Kept the kids busy for hours! highly recommend as a gift."
"This is definitely for little kids. Easy to put together and move. Not sure how long it‚Äôll last. It‚Äôs not too sturdy. Kids could easily reach basket trying to dunk on it but that would break it for sure. I had to stop them from doing it.  It‚Äôs entertaining."
"Pretty sturdy, yet light, easy to maneuver, easy to take apart/put back together. Comes with the balls and a pump so that is nice. Great for our 4 and 7 year olds"
"The quality of the product is not so great. It's delicate and balls are too small, the air filling equipment is very difficult to use.  Not so fun in installment. But, kids enjoy for sometime that's good.  Overall average"
"I was really excited for this item. Easy to assemble. However, it is more appropriate for under 6. I got it for my 9-year-old, and it is too small for him. Its a really cute idea for a room, and I liked the bottom to store stuffed animals with. Great buy but for younger kids."
"My kid had a mini sized real basketball about the size of the little thin rubber balls this came with, and he threw it in there and when it rolled down the ramp and got to the bottom the ramp cloth split. Super disappointing and a waste of money."
"My grandson just loves it! And so does his daddy! My grandson is 9 years old and we got this for his birthday as he loves to play at the arcades. So now he enjoy, together with friends, to play! And best, the way it is set, you can change the height of the basket! He just absolutely loves it"
"Washable yet fun for kids. Better than other makeup for kids."
"My daughter love this product, we love the variety of items the product came with, very cute and a value for money."
"It's perfect for a 3 yr old"
"This is the perfect gift for little girls. The size is great, it has storage for brushes, the colors are bright and it has glitter. My daughter loves to play make up and it is easy to remove with make up removal or soap."
"The makeup quality is great , it’s washable. And safe for your girl kids to play with and it is a fun toy bring joy to your kids face 🥰💯"
"This is really beautiful. My granddaughter loves bath bombs. She is going to enjoy these. She will be surprised with a little piece  of jewelry.  She will love."
"The colors were fine especially as a kids makeup toy. The size however did supers me for it was smaller than I expected kinda like a jewelry box. Bought it as a gift for my 4 year old niece and she loved, used it everyday till the makeup was all gone, definitely her favorite thing/gift. The weight was very light. It was hard to open especially on the sizes but I was able to open it after a while. The price was kinda high especially for what you get, there are cheaper options but at least the ones I saw didn’t have the same variety as this one."
"The size is nicely compacted. The toy my daughter loved and had fun with it. The functionality of it in the beginning is kinda stiff but once the drawers are opened they become more relaxed. The ease of use after a while is easy. The build quality is nice because you can easily store it in a child’s room."
"This is one of the cutest things ever! The kids loved to see the plants grow and now have a dino habitat in their room. Wonderful buy! 100% recommend!!!!"
"This is an excellent buy for kids who love outdoor activities, would definitely buy again"
"I bought this for my niece as a Christmas present. I asked her mom to let me know how she liked it. This is what she said. It was easy to put together, she did everything herself.  She loved putting it together! I would say it is good quality, and so nice that it comes with everything you need, even a spray bottle. The light makes it look so good! Everyday she would check to see how much the grass grew in the terrarium. She planted some sedum plants in it after the grass died and it is in our livingroom window. Great size for a starter kit. I would buy again and may get one for my son. Definitely worth the money."
"Super fun and cute. I’m a grown man who loves dinosaurs and sucks at growing plants. Hopefully, I will be able to make these suckers grow. I really like the size and design, it can fit nearly anywhere. I might move it to my desk once it sprouts. I will update as it grows!!"
"I haven’t written a review before but this was such a great product I felt I had to.  Got it for my grandson for a project when he stayed with us.  We did it the first day hoping to see some of the grass grow.  The pictures above are 4 days after we planted things.  He has loved going to check on the progress each morning and water it.  It came with everything you need and I added 2 succulents we had at home.  It was easy for him to follow the directions and put things together with a little help.  Definitely worth purchasing for a Dino loving kid!"
"Finally, a perfect birthday present for the nephew that we can have fun doing together without any screens involved! My nephew turned 5 and I always try to find something educational, no screens involved, and hands on that he would have fun with. He came over to my house and we built his terrarium together. It is so stinking cute and even has dinosaur figurines to add into the terrarium, which he extra appreciates as a fellow Dino lover!With the energy of a 5 year old, we were able to put this together in about an hour considering the time to let the dirt expand in the water. I can’t wait to hear about how his plants grow in his terrarium as the days go by. The seeds are chia and another easy to grow grass similar plant so guaranteed to see the plants grow. Imagine a chia pet concept level of ease! This comes with a light and everything you need, even a little mist bottle to water the plants. Just have to plug it in!He loves to get his hands in the dirt and I love teaching him about plants and hope to inspire him to be a future plant parent when he is older to match his auntie’s vibes. :)"
"This is a product perfect for kiddos who love dinosaurs and plants. They can easily assemble the science experiment and they’re on their way to growing greens. Pick your background, arrange your prehistoric lizard babies, and spritz with faucet water, you’ll see seed growth in a snap.The grass outgrew our terrarium within a week and now, three months later, our gift givee’s mom is THREE MONTHS into the daily responsibility of watering the plants to keep them alive.10/10. Great for the classroom and great for the children of your enemies."
"I was looking for a fun activity with my 3 year old nephew currently obsessed with dinosaurs. We had a memorable time creating this terrarium together. He did add a lot more dinosaurs from his own collection, and loved waking up every morning to see the seeds growing. They grew fast!Note: every 3 year old is different, use best judgment when making this purchase for a child younger than the suggested age."
"This is such a fun thing to do with kids! They set it up how they like, no “hard rules” and they get to watch it grow and  see the routes form in the soil"
"So fun to set up. Was a gift for a 4 year old. She loved it.It grew SO much.Really great."
"Easy to assemble for a 6yr old. Just be careful not to pour too much water on the peat, pour it slowly.  Had to squeeze it dry but no big problem. Now waiting for the seeds to grow. My grandson is counting down the days.  Looks magical with the light turned on at night.He loves it !!"
"My son got this for his birthday. He loved the process of putting it together and watching it grow. It quickly died and then he was over it."
"Purchased for my grandson for Christmas and he loves watching things grow in the aquarium. Unfortunately he has lost everything to a house fire. Will may be buying it again."
"My granddaughters love this doll.  Perfect size for toddlers, such a soft doll.  Great gift idea."
"My 2 yr old’s eyes lit up when she saw this baby doll! 😍 It is a smaller doll, but perfect for her little arms. She goes everywhere with us. The full plastic body is great for washing, and the accessories are perfect—Blanket, bottle, binkie, and baba."
"My 2 year old granddaughter loves this doll, she loves that it came with a bottle and pacifier. This doll is very well made and the price was perfect. What I like about it you can purchase doll clothes for it because the clothes that came with the doll is removable."
"This is a gift. This doll is so adorable and soft. Like the few extras."
"Our toddler loves this doll. I chose it for the cute outfit and after reading other reviews I decided to throw away the paci and not give that to her for choking reasons. The baby clothes are soft and the little pink bow is adorable! There are cheaper options out there but it's a pretty good doll"
"My daughter loved this. So cute and very good quality"
"It is so much cuter than the images! It was so nostalgic to see actual socks on a doll again. Can't wait to see my granddaughters face when she opens it this Saturday. The blanket that comes with it is small though."
"Purchased this for my one year old niece and it is perfect size for her compared to most baby dolls!"
"The product itself is quite cute and a perfect size for little ones.  However, the doll is not soft in any way.  It is reasonably hard bodied.  I was looking for a soft body doll that could be used as a cuddle toy.  Perhaps I misread the description."
"She was happy and the doll was sturdy and stunning worth the money and the color was beautiful"
"Great doll. It arrived fast. My daughter loves it"
"Great gift for my daughters friends birthday.  Affordable, and arrived as pictured."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



No complaints. She’s a gorgeous doll. Two points of articulation being the shoulders and the hips. Does not come with a stand or comb/brush. I look forward to buying others."
"Perfect"
"Cons:-Arms and legs do not bend-Sash/cover up does not go around her because it is too smallPros:-Really high quality for the price-Beautiful and exactly as advertised"
"My granddaughter loves these dolls. And I like there are so many to choose from… although they remind me of Bratz dolls my daughter used to play with decades ago. But I guess everything comes around again & again. Great doll for the price."
"This line of Rainbow High dolls and theiraccessories are very well made. They are not jointed like most of the Rainbow High dolls, but I think that it is a good alternative and has a more sculptural quality."
"Love rainbow high dolls they are made so well yes somewhat inappropriate in some eyes but yknow normalising is key this particular set they pretend they on holiday and do gymnastics they learn about what place they visit backing up with searching of holidays abroad connect with colours sometimes even mix the clothing to the doll even come up with weather situations “oh it’s so sunny must wear suncream” imagination bargain price"
"Me and my daughter were really impressed with the quality of this. Doll, it was not poorly made like some of them Aren't made with good plastic and poorly Put together this doll had really good quality Arms and legs were attached Solidly And head is well Axon doll for 3 years old and up"
"My girl (age 5) loves her Chelsea doll and car! It‚Äôs cute and good quality. We‚Äôve had it for almost a year and it‚Äôs still brand new looking. Perfect gift!"
"It‚Äôs a cute toy and just as expected. It has received a lot of play time and it was a good price."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



This is a very cute Chelsea car! The stickers add a fun element to dress up the car. It's a two seater which I didn't know when I bought it, so two Chelsea dolls can fit, plus the dog if you sit it on her lap! If you have the Chelsea camper car, it seats one doll. The ribbon tail is cute. Only disappointment is the trunk doesn't open. Love it overall and a great addition to my daughter's Barbie Chelsea collection!"
"Product looked good however these were purchased for family we adopted for Christmas."
"This car is the cutest little thing my 21 month old granddaughter just loves it. All the parts are secure. It‚Äôs safe and very much fun for them. I highly recommend this."
"This set is so cute, the car actually rolls which is great, The stickers are super cute and the car has been decorated a bit in the pictures. This doll is also able to stand up on her own which is an added feature I didn't know about, I didn't think Barbie toys could do that The only problem I have so far is when I removed her sunglassed so her hair could be restyled, I noticed a spot where no hair is threaded, and she's bald there which was unfortunate. You can style her hair to cover this kind of but that was disappointing and I recommend leaving the sunglasses where they are to avoid some of that. Also again with the hair, I noticed she had a tiny section of her layered hairdo that didn't quite work (a bit too long) but it was a tiny section that I was able to easily trim off. I like the layered look of her hair but some people might not. Overall I'd say she is very functional for what she is. Her shirt is actually a one-piece bathing suit painted/molded to her so only the skirt is removable but that's quite nice actually because it gives her two separate outfits. Overall for $13.99, I'd say she's great for the price point because she comes with he car and the puppy, and the stickers as well."
"My neice loved it, price wasn't bad. Seemed sturdy. She was happy."
"Like, Christmas present"
"This will be a treasured Christmas for my grand daughter."
"It is of good quality."
"4 year old granddaughter loves the doll. Good size for her."
"My little 2 year old loves this little set. The baby and carrier are pretty small, I expected bigger but it’s actually good because my toddler can carry it easier. Nice quality, high end looking and soft. She carries this baby everywhere!"
"My niece loved this baby and carrier which was perfect for her little hands!Good accessories for her to keep busy with."
"My 2-year-old granddaughter loves the doll. It has a hard body.  Now I need to find doll clothes for it."
"i got this doll for my one year old. it’s her first doll. she really likes it. she brings it everywhere and it’s easy to clean and sturdy. i would purchase it again"
"So soft and perfect size for little ones!"
"My little girl Loves this doll with pacifier & loves covering with blanket in ""bed"". Great gift."
"My 3 yr old granddaughter was super happy with her gift"
"This doll is adorable and looks like a real baby. She’s not made of hard plastic which makes her very comfortable to hold. I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loves this doll! It has drawn the attention of other adults, thinking that she is holding a real baby! They are interested in purchasing this doll for their child!"
"Grand Daughter gift.  This stole the party!  There was nothing that caught her attention like this beautiful baby girl.  Thank you !!  Great product."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I thought it was a good price for this doll. It’s the perfect weight for my 5 year old. Not super heavy like some other dolls. Limbs are a little hard to move but not bad. The doll isn’t creepy looking like others I have gotten in the past! Cute face and great size! Hand feet and lines on arms and legs are perfect!"
"She’s so beautiful I’m crying! I wish her hair wasn’t painted on, but it’s okay. I wanted a more realistic reborn doll, but the prices are out of my range. I am satisfied."
"The doll looks like the picture but the body of the doll is not vinyl. Just the face, arms and legs.  It’s a cute doll."
"Omg this baby doll os just perfect  every one thinks it real.  My 3yr old loves it."
"My daughter loved this baby. Dislike that the legs don't move."
"I was quite impressed how real this doll looks and came with baby bottles, soothers, diaper and hospital ankle ID! I’m sure my 2 yr old granddaughter will love it for Christmas!"
"I thought this reborn doll would be just like the others by this same brand, with an anatomically correct body, but the body is cloth. For the same price as the other ones I don’t understand why there wouldn’t be some sort of indication in this listing about the body type. Very disappointed as my daughter wanted this doll to be able to give baths and play with as a real baby."
"This doll surpassed my expectations! As we all (should) know, REAL reborns are A LOT more expensive & hand made. So I wasn’t expecting anything close. But this baby’s details, softness & realistic face & body comes close! This was definitely worth the money. I recommend especially if you want to get a “reborn” for your toddler or just start your collection."
"This was a birthday gift for my friends daughter. The doll is super cute! Came with a bottle 2 little rattle toys and a magnetic pacifier."
"They look so real. Awesome, was happy."
"It is so cute and my family will be sending me pictures as she opens them.  WIll update when I hear what she has to say.  Her name is also Skylar and her facial expression is so simular to her."
"Bought this for my 8 yr old niece who is very active. She brought this baby with her everywhere except school for almost a year and it’s still going strong!"
"I loved the doll. She came right on time. She is absolutely beautiful! I was disappointed her name from the description was not anywhere on the box or literature. There was a blank birth certificate that I was able to pen her name in. She will be loved by my granddaughter. 💖"
"My daughter loved this so much. It so very nice quality, and the accessories were a great!"
"We ordered 2 of these dolls.  One for each of our youngest Granddaughters.  It’s almost scary how lifelike these dolls are.  Other than being slightly smaller than a real baby, which is perfect, because they are just the right size for a 6 and 8 year old, they really look like newborn babies.  Be warned they are very accurate.  In other words, they are anatomically correct which kind of surprised my wife 😊I’m far from being a doll expert, but they appear to be very well made and durable.  So far they have survived a few temper tantrums unscathed.The Girls absolutely love them.  They carry them around and treat them like real babies.  I’m really glad to see them playing with something that stimulates their imaginations as opposed to being on an iPad all day.Yeah, they cost a little more than the run-of-the-mill big box toy dolls, but they are definitely worth it."
"I am very disappointed with this doll. No soft feel with this hard plastic doll, especially for the amount of money I have spent."
"My daughter will love this at Christmas, fast delivery to the uk will definitely order again :)"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



So realistic when it cries and it really does walk and crawl !"
"We love this brand feels like real baby !!"
"I ordered this baby doll for my 4 year old niece.  One of the eyes does not close by itself, which upsets her.  She will not let loose of the doll long enough to return it.  Any suggestionsBroke"
"This is a very cute doll for little one ! I bought this doll for my granddaughter, for her 3 years birthday and she love it very much! Thanks a lot !"
"my daughter loves doctors , and she loves Barbie’s even more so this was a perfect toy to just buy for her ! she’s 3 and i found it perfect for her age range she did good with the small pieces as well"
"My granddaughter is 22 months old and one of her favorite books is about a little bunny who goes to see the doctor.  She studies each page and is very interested in all the things the doctor does, checking heartbeat, ears, throat.  She is also a big Barbie fan so this set was the perfect gift.  It was an early Christmas gift and she LOVES it.  Barbie's hands are styled so that she can hold her stethoscope to check the babies heartbeat.  The babies are very cute, the diapers are not great, one has been lost already, but it doesn't matter to her.  She carries the babies around and always asks for ""Doctor"".  The little cart is cute and she likes to play with it, too.  The set comes with two little bottles for the babies and Barbie is able to hold them.  The little hand sanitizer bottle is cute - my granddaughter pretends that she's squirting the sanitizer on her hands.  Doctor Barbie has examined all of her other Barbies, stuffed animals, and other dolls.  Overall a wonderful little set that sparks the imagination."
"Exactly what my daughter wanted."
"Kiddo loves it! Good quality and can’t beat the price for hours of play"
"This was a birthday gift for a 3 year old little girl who is in love with Barbie.  She loved the Barbie, that she could be the doctor/nurse for two babies.  Perfect gift for her!!!"
"I recently purchased the ""Barbie Baby Doctor Playset"" for my daughter and overall, we were quite happy with it. The set comes with a Barbie doll dressed in scrubs, as well as two baby dolls, medical accessories, and a baby scale. The pieces are all made of durable plastic and seem to be of good quality.One of the things I really liked about this set was the attention to detail. The medical accessories, such as the stethoscope and thermometer, looked just like the real thing, and my daughter loved pretending to use them on her patients. The baby dolls were also very cute and my daughter enjoyed taking care of them.The only reason I am giving this set 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish there were more accessories included. For example, it would have been nice to have a small bed or crib for the babies to sleep in. Additionally, while the set is great for imaginative play, it may not hold the attention of older children for very long.Overall, I would recommend the ""Barbie Baby Doctor Playset"" for any child who loves playing doctor or taking care of babies. It's a great addition to any toy collection and is sure to provide hours of imaginative play."
"Bought for our 5 year old granddaughter.  This barbie is adorable."
"Perfect for any little girl that loves to play nurse doctor or mommy"
"Everything you need to pretend to take care of small babies. Very cute. Great set to add to a doll house."
"We are very into barbies and role play and this set didn’t disappoint. You get a lot of items for the price and the two baby barbies are just adorable. Also comes with lots of accessories for endless fun! Perfect set for a gift!"
"Great set! Got it for my sons bday and he was very happy with all the different items."
"This 76-piece set is a fantastic value! The variety of pencils and sketchbook offer endless creative possibilities. Perfect for artists of all levels."
"The Prima 76 piece art set is a fantastic set for any artist, beginner or experienced. The set includes a wide range of high-quality art supplies, including colored pencils, watercolor paints, oil pastels, and more. The colors are vibrant and blend well, allowing for endless creative possibilities. The set also comes in a durable and compact case, making it easy to take on the go. Overall, I highly recommend the Prima 76 piece art set for anyone looking to expand their artistic horizons."
"Bought this as a gift for a family member, and I love how it has everything you need to get started with sketching and drawing. Everything seems high quality and super excited to see the resulting masterpieces it makes! Super beginner friendly and very affordable."
"Bought this for my 13 y/o. He loves it and uses it often. Have a good variety and quality pencils for a good price."
"The zipper case as well as the art supplies are decent quality. The different meduims make it easy to do many projects. Bonus....when finished it stores organized and zipped up for next time.  it's about the size of a sketch book."
"We gifted this to our 10 year old grandson who has developed an interest in drawing! It was perfect for him! Looks very nice and the case it comes in is nice!"
"This was definitely worth the price.  It even had its own cover bookMy granddaughter loved it"
"It was a gift for someone. She loved it."

These Kalour soft core colored pencils, 72 set, exceeded my expectations! The vibrant pigments and smooth application make coloring a delightful experience. The blendability is fantastic, allowing for beautiful transitions between shades. There are Many main shades of colors to make blending seamless. For example, there are at least 10 to 15 shades of green and at least 10 shades of purple. On the back of the packaging, there is a swatch list which has the number and the color And the name for each of the 72 shades. I found that already made swatch list helpful when picking a color theme. The sturdy build ensures durability, and the wide range of colors provides endless creative possibilities. There are color, pencils that I like better but at this price points I think these are the best softcore pencils that I have come across. Compared to the other well-known softcore colored pencils that start with a P, These are not soft, not as blendable, and not as waxy. But the price is awesome and they do a nice job!  A must-have for artists of all levels!"
"As a student they are really nice and affordable price. I love that it has different colors, smooth and siz is good, sharp, and excellent function"
"This set is beautiful its the perfect size for the money and shares the sharpness, thickness, and durability of its competitors. You can't beat the price for the quality"
"These are nice soft-lead pencils with good colour and a wide selection- I‚Äôve made several illustrations with them so far and I like them! My only complaint is that when sharpening them, I‚Äôve sometimes run into issues with the lead breaking in the pencil as it‚Äôs being sharpened, no matter how carefully I do it; it‚Äôs hard to get a good point on the lead without breaking."
"Got these on sale for incredibly cheap, and they're amazing. The color is nice and I'd personally say they're easy to blend. Nice with alcohol markers, too."
"Ery smooth gliding pencils and lots of colors.  Good pricing.  Only negative is box they come in not sturdy.  I‚Äôll have to put them in something else."
"I love coloring the cat breed coloring books with these pencils.  The images are grayscale but you really achieve great results by layering the colors.  _ I loved the selection and they are really great to work with."
"These were my first ""soft"" colored pencils so I was not exactly  sure what to expect.  What I discovered was more vibrant colors and more even colors.  I just color for fun so honestly I have no artistic ability.  The colors are more even and the effect is so much more attractive. I whole heatedly give this product an A plus!.  You will enjoy them."
"Bought this for a friend, these are a very nice set. Value for the cost is good. Great variety of colours."
"I already have a larger set of these pencils which  my husband bought from Amazon for me and I love them and use them daily, even though I have other pencil sets which are more expensive. I am ucky enough to own the  500 set ,I have bought this set to take with me on a short break with a minature colouring book and didnt want to carry  a large set around with me. Once I come back they will add to my original set and replace some of those pencils which are now becoming too small.The colours themselves are lovely and there is a good variety in the shades.  They work well for shading, and they also work well on different paper, so for instance the amazon paper. They sharpen easily (just dont make them really pointy as the point tends to snap off even when colouring lightly), They are easy to hold and I find I can erase them when making errors.I would definately recommend you buy these to start your colouring journey or as a gift for someone, in fact buy a larger size you wont be disappointed."
"I recently purchased art supplies from Posca Markets for my daughters, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The selection of Posca markers available is incredible, offering a wide range of vibrant colors and various nib sizes. My daughters were thrilled with their new markers and have been creating beautiful artwork ever since.The quality of the Posca markers is outstanding. They produce such rich, vibrant colors and are versatile enough to be used on different surfaces. It's been a joy to see my daughters' creativity blossom with these high-quality tools.Overall, Posca Markets has exceeded our expectations, providing top-notch art supplies that have made my daughters super happy. I highly recommend Posca Markets to any parent looking to inspire their children's creativity!"
"These are so smooth and nice, the colors are vibrant,didnâ€™t seep through the page, no horrible smell, covers the page, very saturated and good quality markers."
"These are bold in their color, and are a great deal for this amount of markers. Easy to use and high quality. Highly recommend if you need an indoor kid activity."
"This was a great product! Loved the colors and variety, and really pretty and good quality! Recommend!"
"the colors are deep and true to what is expected. the markers do not pass through the paper. they are great for painting on glass or any material and easy to wash off. also great for paper."
"i first bought these markers a little over 2 years ago. used them a bunch and then moved/gained other hobbies which led me to not using them for over a year. well i picked up painting again and these markers still work as though i never stopped using them. definitely worth the price!"
"Beautiful, vivid colors that apply easily! These markers are wonderful quality and worth getting if you can get a discount (it's pretty expensive otherwise). Product photograph is misleading as the markers don't come in a single box; I received 29 unique colors, but it was spread out between 2 smaller sets and some loose markers. However, everything was brand new and in good condition, and each loose marker was encased in shrink-wrap for protection, soAlso, I've seen some reviews talking about ""Chinese"" writing on the markers which is wince-inducing; Posca is from the Japanese brand Mitsubishi and the labels are in Japanese! Just FYI since apparently it's too difficult for people to tell that's the case ðŸ™„. It doesn't mean the markers are fake. The marker set includes all of the colors available to the Japanese market from what info I can find, which means there are some USA colors not included in the set and some colors specific to Japanese Posca markers. If you want some of the exclusive USA metallic colors, for instance, you'll have to buy another set."
"I donâ€™t love that u canâ€™t do a second coat on some surfaces. Color options arenâ€™t great, would prefer dual or brush tips, a tad pricey, would love a case, but good paint pens for sure."
"I saw the amount of positive reviews and decided to take a chance.  These are at a very low cost, (these are $9/pen at my local art house), so even though these were ""cheap"" it still felt like an enormous purchase for me.What can I say? These were worth every penny! They don't take long to prime, the tip is a nice felt rather than hard pastic, so the lines are smooth and theres no blops falling out and being pushed around like with other brands I tried before. The tips are reversible too! I was thrilled to see that frugal me will be able to squeeze every drop from them.The colours are true to the cap, so no guesswork when selecting.So far if I could give these more than 5 stars I would, they appear to be the real Posca deal and not a cheap knock off!I was worried bc the 1 star reviews made me worry I made a mistake, but there were relatively few so I took a chance.  For me this is something I would really be sad I didn't take advantage of.The coverage is incredible, even when marking the blacks caps, they showed up solidly and vividly.Every single one worked well, there were none dry, no leaking in the package as with some of the negative reviews.As an artist who has sold plenty of work and taught in a gallery I see these suiting your needs well!"
"Good, but not worth 10k. 2-3k is a reasonable price for this."
"Crayola Air Dry Clay is a versatile and user-friendly option for crafting enthusiasts of all ages. It‚Äôs especially popular for children and beginners because it doesn‚Äôt require any special equipment to harden‚Äîjust leave it out, and it dries naturally within 24-48 hours. This makes it a fantastic choice for those who don‚Äôt have access to a kiln or want a low-maintenance alternative to traditional clay.Texture & Workability:The texture of the clay is soft and pliable right out of the package, which makes it easy to mold and shape. It doesn‚Äôt stick too much to your hands, which is great for working on detailed projects. It‚Äôs an excellent medium for creating sculptures, ornaments, pinch pots, and other crafts. Kids will especially love how easy it is to handle and shape.Drying Process:One of the main advantages is the air-dry feature. There‚Äôs no need for baking or firing in a kiln, which eliminates the risks and difficulties associated with traditional clay. However, you do need to give it ample time to fully dry, and thicker projects may take longer. While it dries well, be aware that larger or thicker pieces might develop some minor cracks during the drying process, which can usually be smoothed out or fixed with additional clay.Durability:Once dry, Crayola Air Dry Clay has a solid but somewhat brittle finish. While it holds its shape well, it‚Äôs not as durable as kiln-fired clay. If you‚Äôre working on projects that need to withstand wear and tear, you might want to reinforce them or handle them with care. That said, it‚Äôs still great for lightweight decorative items, school projects, or pieces that will be used indoors.Customization & Painting:One of the best features of this clay is that it can be painted once dry. You can use acrylic paints, watercolors, or even markers to add color and details to your creations. The surface of the dried clay is smooth and easy to decorate, allowing for vibrant, personalized designs. You can also seal your finished pieces with a varnish or sealant to add a protective layer and enhance durability.Clean-Up & Storage:Another major advantage is the ease of clean-up. The clay washes off hands and surfaces with just water, making it ideal for parents or teachers supervising younger kids. Unused clay can be stored in an airtight container to keep it soft and ready for future projects, but be sure to seal it well, as it can dry out if exposed to air.Final Thoughts:Crayola Air Dry Clay is a fantastic product for both novice and experienced crafters. It‚Äôs easy to mold, requires no baking, and allows for endless creativity. While it may not be as durable as traditional fired clay, it‚Äôs an excellent choice for decorative projects and a fun, mess-free activity for kids. The ability to paint and customize finished pieces makes it even more versatile, offering a full range of creative possibilities!"
"I bought this to make my own vases and magnets. For a beginner, this is great! I like that you can paint over it once it dries, so you can make your art any color! The quality is good, it is easy to use and maintain. It does crack a little on some projects, but it depends. It gets super sticky when you wet it, and can be pretty messy. It is a soft texture though, it is fun to use!"
"I purchased this to make crafts with the grandchildren.  The first order arrived with the tub cracked, but was quickly replaced.  We first made ghosts for Halloween and it was easy to roll (even for the 3yo with a little help)."
"For a senior year high school project last year, I made the colosseum almost entirely out of this clay. My time limit was around 2 months, and I put almost 80 hours into this project. It ended up sitting on a 16-inch long base and weighed in at 6.8 pounds when completely dry. I used approximately 2 of the 5 pound containers. I don't think this clay is perfect, but I think of all of the options out there, this has to be the best option when making large projects and not having the option of kiln firing.Cracking is to be expected. When adding water to the clay or simply using it straight out of the package the moisture takes up a lot of space and naturally, it is going to shrink when dry. I ended up using cracks to determine where the weak points were. When filling in cracks ALWAYS overfill the crack, the clay that you put in is going to shrink, and it's easier to shave down bumps than continuing to fill in cracks that don't seem to go away.I found that carving this clay was easier than molding it. I included a picture of the details on the interior, they were for the most part entirely made by carving clay out of each row. This clay is really hard to make small shapes and strings with, so if your project is small or has tons of tiny details I would suggest picking up modeling clay instead, although making small details IS still possible, just more time-consuming.Joining pieces of clay together can be a challenge, I found that adding lots of water and smoothing down the sides of the piece you want to join to the project. Trying to join pieces in the ""traditional"" way (making a few lines in either piece, adding water, and pressing together) does not work with this clay, it's very stubborn.I had a big issue when starting this project as to where I was going to put it. I decided on a cardboard base, but I couldn't get the clay to stick very well. I found that gluing paper down to the cardboard and adding a thin layer of water to the top got the clay to stick. after the first layer, I had to deal with shrinking and added a second piece of cardboard to the bottom, since it bent the first one.Another trick I found was mixing acrylic paint directly into the clay can change the color and you can mix other materials into the clay- I used both of these on the sandy floor of the colosseum, beige paint and actual sand were mixed in and the clay worked just as it normally would.I seriously enjoyed working with this material, you get a ton for the price, and it works really well. This project was the first time I had ever made something large and to scale with clay, and while it does come with a learning curve, I really enjoy recreating places with it. Currently, I am working on a model of Mont St Michele, and after I will be working on making the Statue of Liberty"
"very good quality clayboth of my kids were able to create different projectsits a good quality clay ( please keep in mind it can stain)to keep it from drying out (unused portions ) either zip lock it or keep it refrigerated"
"Bought it for my son‚Äôs school project. It molds well and dried hard in about 2 days. Only complaint is that i noticed 1 crack on the little Indian hut he made as it dried but that‚Äôs probably to be expected."
"Great product! I would recommend. Durable, doesn't smell, and perfect texture and easy to work with. Perfect for crafters and kid activities!"
"For a family fun activity we made so many neat, fall-time decorations for our home. It was fast drying and easy to paint up. To seal, we used a matte mod podge"
"Perfect for school projects!"
"Got for my daughter who loves doing art. Great price and paper is good quality"
"Great quality for the price. I purchased for my son he was always complaining about his drawing fading or when he pants it bleeds though . Now he doesn’t have those problems with this drawing book he love the texture pages, no bleeding because of the thickness of the paper GREAT BUY"
"Let me introduce you to the perfect sketchbook for young artists – it's kid-friendly, with thick pages that can handle all kinds of mediums like markets, pastels, and colored pencils.

"The heavy paper does not bleed through"
"My granddaughter loves it!"
"Great sketch pad for my grandbaby she loves to draw pages are nice and thick and sturdy she loves it"
"Size, quality and price were great for this sketch book that my son needed for his art class"
"Came in good shape. Awesome quality. I will be purchasing again"
"I love these markers. I'm an adult that enjoys coloring. These markers are great for vibrant colors. The different tips allow me to add details to my projects."
"Crayola has been around forever. But they have not lost their quality. These were perfect for my project. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on the professional ones out there. But, I didn’t want to buy cheap and low quality either. These were exactly what I needed. I would continue to recommend them for anyone doing general projects - school boards, school art, arts & crafts projects around the house, etc. The dual ends are perfect. They are ergonomic fir adults, simple enough for beginners and young ones to use. The colors are exact, they do not over saturate or bleed through the paper, poster board & they're ez wash-yeah, who is going to lie & claim they NEVER get markers on your skin while using them (any brand?)"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Purchased for my 9 y/o who is just getting into drawing. It’s a nice beginner set and has just enough colors."
"Crayola has really upped their game with the adult coloring world. This includes the brand new brush markers coming from Crayola for all your calligraphy needs. Modern calligraphy is getting huge and these are perfectly priced for beginners and even for experts alike. Tombows are popular but Crayola is priced right as being a good beginner style marker to start off with until you're comfortable buying a more expensive brand. These markers have two tips - a brush tip and a smaller, finer brush tip. Each comes in two different colors. The brush tip is just slightly darker than it's counter end of the finer brush tip. 16 markers in all, with 32 different colors but about 16 different colors with two-toned shades of each color.I learned very quickly these are something that you have to use delicately. The brush tip is great for good thick strokes going down and soft light strokes going up but I've learned too quickly that pressing too hard on a brush tip pen will fray the tip. I would actually strongly advise using a regular Crayola or another brand marker in the fat/thin variables first and get your drills down and then once you've mastered the drills and build up your muscles in your wrist and hand to venture into these brush pens as well. Lettering is an art form and like any art form, it takes practice and technique to get it down. I definitely suggest buying these but feel comfortable with the strokes and drills of the lettering as well.I think that the experts of the lettering world will love these as a comparative marker to the other name brand markers and brush pens out there to do just as good of a job. I just wish I would have really practiced my techniques and drills before going fully into learning with these and ultimately fraying a few of the ends of the bigger brush tips.Beginner, expert, novices, all rejoice!  These are some beautiful brush pens at a great affordable price to give you two shades of color to practice gradient, brush techniques, and so much more. They also come in a very nice tin box to store in. I will be getting more practice in and  be sure to lighten my hand a little before purchasing again but you can bet I will be purchasing another set of these - so don't stop creating awesome things, Crayola!"
"This is a great set of markers if you are interested in beginning to color. I would recommend this set for adults and children alike. The colors are vibrant, the colors really stand out, and they blend well."
"I write with them, draw and paint with them. I also sketch with them."
"My daughter is very artsy and was interested in trying some calligraphy for fun.  These brush pens were a great option because the pack has so many colors.  Each pen has a brush side and a point side as well.Crayola is very dependable in their quality, and that does not change for this product.  None of the pens are dried out or seem to any time soon.The set was a bit expensive in my opinion, but it seems that all brush pen sets are.  I went with this set because it was on the cheaper side and I knew Crayola wouldn't disappoint."
"Yellow detail tip is the colour of a highlighter. Otherwise its a decent product for the price"
"Very nice and good quality"
"They were great"
"Nice quality."
"The durability of the pencils are great if you do not color or write hard. The appearance is exactly like the photo. Be performance is great. The colors are vibrant. The versatility is great you can choose from pencil to paint to paint to markers. Age range is 8 and up."
"I had these on a wish list for my daughter and a few months before her birthday they dropped to 40% off. It's a large kit, easy to keep organized, great for an aspiring artist. She loves some of the unexpected elements, like the knife, and uses it in ways I would never have imagined, including painting, sculpting, and shading."
"I purchased this art supply kit for a young family member who is passionate about art. This includes participating in art fairs and drawing classes as well as writing children’s books featuring her adopted cat, Mike. When the kit arrived, I was pleased to see that it was beautifully packaged and contained a wide range of colors and accessories – making the kit versatile and impressive! The set features a wide and diverse range of colors. Each is represented beautifully and the carrying case makes it suitable for travel, both to and from school and everywhere in between. The colors stayed sharp and vibrant, and my family member has seen a dramatic uptick in the quantity and quality of her artwork."
"The kit have many options included to draw and have a good time."
"I bought this for my 9 year old niece for Christmas this year(2024) it's October currently so the product has not been used yet. I was a little surprised that this is marketed towards kids and teens considering that it comes with a retractable razor blade. And I understand that some people will cut things for their art no hate on that. Just that if you have it marketed towards kids and teens offer an option without the razor blade. Now I'm not going to give the blade to her but if I hadn't opened it an then i found out my niece was cutting herself with part of my gift i would be disheartened by that"
"I like all the colors wished came with instructions on how to use the water pencils which had to Google , the draw pads are small but doable!"
"Bought this as a birthday gift and my daughter let us know her friend loved it. It looked so colorful and inviting to start drawing. Everything inside looked like it was made well over all good quality."
"This kit of 73 art supplies is a great buy for a teen or adult who has some experience (even if minimal) with art/sketching.  It is a comprehensive set that includes about all the sketching materials one would need such as several types of colored pencils, sketching pencils, graphite for shading/blending, pencil sharpener, nice eraser, one paintbrush, a sketchbook and coloring book.  It is all enclosed in a nice, zippered case with a carrying strap.  Because of how comprehensive it is, I'd not recommend for a younger child.My only disappointment was in the size of the sketchpad.  It's only 5"" x 7"" with 28 pages.But beyond that, it is a great buy.  Recommend!"
"I bought these for a special after school/weekend art class for 8-9 year old kids.  These sets will be great with all the different art mediums"
"This kids' art set is a solid choice! It comes with crayons, pencils, pastels, markers and paper, providing a variety of tools for creative expression. The quality of the materials is great, and the assortment ensures endless possibilities for young artists to explore. Highly recommended for sparking imagination and artistic fun!"
"My daughter loves it she is 6years old and love to draw and use it all the time. Sometime she use the map pencil and switch the next time. They also last very long time as well. Love how the case can be taken any where and it keeps every organized."
"Great variety, colorful! If you have a kid who likes art this is a fun gift."
"We got this as a Christmas gift for our son. The packaging and case for this product is pretty flimsy and not the best quality. The same can be said for the art supplies in it. It’s good for an inexpensive art kit, but keep your expectations low"
"My grandkids have been busy creating"
"She loved it and it created hours of fun"
"The packaging is great,it keeps all the art pieces together."
"I purchased this art kit for a 9-year-old girl, and I was so impressed with the quality and variety of supplies that I ended up buying it for another 9-year-old as well! This art set has everything a young artist could need, including oil pastels, crayons, colored pencils, sketch pads, and even a double-sided trifold easel that makes it easy for her to draw and create anywhere.The case is well-organized and easy to carry, making it a perfect gift for kids who love to craft. The supplies are high-quality and allow for a lot of creativity, whether she’s sketching, coloring, or experimenting with different art techniques. The pink case and design are adorable, making it a fun and stylish gift.It’s a great value for the price, and both girls absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this art kit as a thoughtful, creative gift for any young artist!"
"Product came as described. It was a gift for 6 year old and she absolutely loved it. Quality is also good as expected for price paid. Hope the marker pens do not dry out soon. Thanks"
"Good set but it arrived broken on one side. It was supposed to be a gift but I didn't feel comfortable giving it like this..."
"Its was extremely organized. Amazing quality. Some small pieces. Color accurate. worth money spent."
"Have the kids use their creative abilities! They'll be great at drawing on paper, making jewelry, and having summer and winter fun. This is an all-weather activity. Great buy!!!"
"This kit is fabulous. My niece is into all sorts of crafts.  She absolutely loved all the different components of this.  She can make so many different things the way she wants.  Would definitely recommend this item"
"It is a great product and gift for crafting and creating. Packaged very well."
"I bought this as a gift for my grandkids.  It looks exactly like the picture.  I am excited about giving this to them."
"9 year old still enjoys it. Variety of trinkets. Fun to do multiple crafts. Hard to slide everything back into the box once opened."
"Two of the ‚Äúwooden‚Äù beads were brown/gray AND deformed. So I‚Äôll never forget the fecal necklace I turned into a butterfly just by twisting the pipe cleaner and introducing wings.Otherwise, this is a superb box. The stretch bead jewelry cord can make many more pieces than there are beads in this kit. I remember we used to do square knots and even some jeweler‚Äôs super glue. Without a couple of square knots that cord won‚Äôt stay knotted.Even my 3yo can cut into the pipe cleaners with the provided scissors. The sequins are study as heck. The gem stickers and eyes really, truly stick, but can be reused with hot glue. This is a wonderful kit.If you end up with pipe cleaner jewelry, bend one end of the necklace or bracelet about an inch and a half from the end, twist it around itself a few times, and create a re-bendable hook. Measure how much you want or need on the other end, bend the cleaner at a 90-degree angle, make a loop, and secure the loop so you have fashioned an eye.This would make an amazing gift for a child of 3-14, and has literally helped my children (3 and 5) work together or chat as they create. No punching or hair-pulling. It‚Äôs been a crazy four months, and now my daughter is 3, so all of a sudden peace reigns again.I highly recommend this specific kit. It‚Äôs not cheap, the beads and sequins are not at all flimsy, the wooden pieces are custom shaped, and it won‚Äôt be hard to want to keep what your kids make üòâ"
"Lots of quality craft items included."
"Got this massive craft supply kit for the kids. It has tons of stuff for making bracelets, crafts, art projects etc. Great for rainy days when we're stuck indoors and don't want to waste the whole day on screens."
"The packaging held bk this item as draws but flimsy also the glue provided doesn't stick to the crafting items"
"This was on one of my kids Christmas lists and they loved it. I was hesitant to purchase it at first, as it seemed like you could easily recreate this set with items from the dollar store. When it arrived and we saw everything inside I realized what a great craft set it is. I love that it comes in a case so everything is easy to clean up and organize. There are so many materials included that I would be surprised if we ever ran out of craft stuff again! It has giant pipe cleaners, regular pipe cleaners, wooden spools, string, beads, pompoms, and so many other items. I think I even remember seeing glue in the box.I would definitely purchase this set again, and I think it makes a great gift for crafty kids. Everything seems to be of good quality and I love how colourful all of the craft supplies are."
"It's okay, my kids like it but for the price I was expecting more. I just picked up an arts and craft kit from a local store for ¬£6 that has about half the amount of items. My kids enjoyed it though. I did think that for the price an ideas book would come with it but sadly no."
"Lots of stuff to do"
"I purchased this for an angel tree gift to give to a child from a less fortunate home. This product had the most complete set and variety of colors that I could find for the price point. Great for gifting to get someone started in their passion for art!"
"I bought this for a friend who loves to draw. It included everything she needed and it was good quality for a great price!"
"I like the quality of the pencils and the variety of things that came in it . The size was good and I had easy access to each item and was able to store them away properly. I was able to carry them around all the time and easily use them . I love the color that I was given and the versatility was great"
"I bought this as a birthday present for a friend of mine and so far they are enjoying it!  I have not heard any complaints."
"Everything"
"My daughter loves this gift. She has been using it since she got it for her birthday."
"Granddaughter loves to draw. This had everything she needed"
"It was a gift and they loved it!"
"I'm very impressed with the assortment provided for sketching and drawing. I like that all the graphite pencils are included as well as white and black charcoal and charcoal sticks are especially pleasing. I am very glad that sandpaper and a variety of blending stumps are included. Makes a great value. The included sketch pad is also nice and comes in 3 colors: white, black, and tan.I'd say the quality of the items themselves is pretty nice. This a very giftable item and great for any art student or beginning artist.The only thing I'd say to improve is the interior design is a bit flimsy (the straps started fraying after day 2 of using it), and the kneaded eraser cannot fit back into it's elastic area once it's been opened and kneaded. If there were a pouch or pocket on the OUTSIDE that could hold the kneaded erasers, that would be ideal. I also feel like pencils will start falling out of their elastic holder if jostled or small - so once again an pocket or multiple pockets would be idea.I also think the knife for sharpening pencils is shoddy and I'm buying a new one right away that is sharper.Overall, glad I made this purchase and it is a great selection of materials."
"The pages are super durable, the charcoal was soft blending, fun to use, and I like the color variety you can get from the pencils."
"I like the pencils, the charcoal pencils and the weight and size is perfect for me. I have tiny hands and it's very comfortable for me to sketch. This would a great gift for Christmas or birthday."
"I like this set. It includes most art pencils you may need stating out. I suggest you order a set of white gel pens in addition, because this kit does not include them. (they are for highlighting) Great value. I'm sure Leonardo would have ordered this kit when he was starting out, had it been available to him. The only drawback I encountered was that the pencils did not indicate what the different pencils were used for. So, experiment with each pencil to see its potential. It comes with 3 charcoal 'bars' and an eraser and sharpener. I had to pick up a WHITE charcoal bar, as it was NOT included in this kit.I think it is good value and I'm glad I have it."

I have only done an unboxing and quick swatching but here is my review thus far:It has been a long while since I’ve gotten the urge to draw anything that wasn’t a doodle on line paper with whatever utensil I had in my hand or at my desk. I was gifted some gorgeous sketch books and decided to find a budget-friendly set of pencils. I was primarily looking for a set of graphite pencils and stumbled on this bundle. For the price of about 5 “fancy” pencils, I could purchase this entire set. Since I am a beginner and haven’t drawn in a while, I decided to go with this option… plus it was one that could be delivered same-day or one-day.After a speedy delivery, I opened the box to find a good quality case. Upon opening, I checked to be sure I wasn’t missing any items and everything came as it should. The instruction booklet leaves you wanting a little but it is nice to have. It includes a suggestion of utensils to complete the picture you see. The sketchbook is a decent size and you get a variety of colors, not just white. You get a good range pencils from hard to soft and the pencils have a decent range as well. The compressed sticks of graphite and charcoal are nice, even though I have to Google how to use them. The sandpaper block comes with a good amount of sheets on it. Everything included seems to be of B to C quality on a grading scale but with all that you get, that is excellent for the price.My only gripes are that the willow charcoal came pretty broken up and my pastels also had a few breaks (only 2 of them, the rest were fine). The blending stumps have slight imperfections but you have a razor right in the package to clean that up! I only took away 1 star for the imperfections but the kit is everything the description says it will be! This is an awesome gift for yourself or anyone (even children) who would like to dip their toes into drawing but need a little push to get started. I can’t wait to sketch with this set and I may update my photos to include completed art. This is a GOOD buy!"
"This is my kiddo's go-to set for art on the move, and they're CONSTANTLY sketching. For those with the need for a basic drawing kit or a thorough at-home set, this one hits the spot. I've seen the pieces stay durable and intact through many an hours-long trip in the car."
"I bought this to use while recovering from surgery.  It was a fun little kit to use.  Lots of choices on pencil weights.  You get a little starter sketchpad which is nice too, but you'll quickly run out of paper.  This is really set up as a gift set.  Everything is cleverly secured with its own elastic which makes the kit very organized, but do I really need to have everything strapped down?  No, not really.  In reality, it would be nice if the erasers, sharpener, etc were loose in a zipper pouch.  In the end, it's great for the price, but really a student starter set. The price is good or what you get.  It's not Koh-I-Noor, but neither is the price. 5 stars"
"Great starter kit!  Lots of goodies and the case is really wrong, serviceable and practical!  Yay!"
"We recently purchased this as a gift for our child's Kindergarten teacher to show our appreciation for all her hard work and care. She absolutely loves it!The set is comprehensive and includes everything an aspiring artist could need. From a variety of sketching pencils to colored pencils, erasers, and blending tools, it‚Äôs all neatly organized in a sturdy case. The inclusion of a tutorial book, sketchbook, and paper is a wonderful touch, making it perfect for both beginners and more experienced artists.The quality of the materials is impressive. The pencils are smooth and easy to work with, and the sketchbook paper is of good quality, making drawing and sketching a pleasure. The tutorial book is a great addition, offering useful tips and techniques that can help enhance one‚Äôs artistic skills.Our child's teacher was thrilled with this gift and has already started using it for her own artwork as well as for classroom activities. It‚Äôs a versatile and practical set that can inspire creativity in anyone who loves to draw and sketch.Overall, it's a fantastic product that provides excellent value for the price. It‚Äôs well-crafted, comprehensive, and perfect for artists of all levels. We highly recommend it as a gift or for personal use. Five stars!"
"My daughter love this. It came with everything. The picture said it would nothing was broken. Nothing was bent, and all the colors of the pencils was so pretty."
"This set has a wide variety of pencils, markers and more.  Great that it comes with a sketch book and watercolor pad so you don't necessarily have to buy paper to use this set unless you want something bigger or more paper.  All items appear to be well made and decent quality.  The zippered case with a place for everything really makes this easy for storage and to keep up with. Very giftable and very fun to use.  Really, really great art set!"
"This is one of the best ive purchased. My grand children loved them and the colors are vibrant and its perfect pen quality and very durable"
"It looks very nice! Many varieties of art supplies to choose from. Compact and organized. Giving it as a Christmas gift and it's only November so I didn't know how the products themselves are. That's why I'm giving it a 4. Will try to update later."
"I had VERY low expectations , but the drawing set just surpassed everything I could have hoped for. High quality, the case is also great quality sturdy , I love that the case doesn‚Äôt have some weird random logo or brand name, the case is a plain all black which I was not expecting but very happy to see. The quality of the supplies is excellent. I got two sets one for each kid and they loved it. I was really surprised by the quality of the color red pencils and how vibrant they were . I will definitely buy from them again !"

Comes with a lot of pencils! Color pencils, metal sharper so it‚Äôs durable two pads one for color other for sketch it‚Äôs amazing for professionals & beginners like me who‚Äôs trying to get make into drawling! I say stop wasting time and get you one so you can start creating your image üíØüíú"
"Great value for the price. This made a fun gift for a friend."
"Great for the kids"
"The Pooboo Folding Exercise Bike is a decent choice for budget-conscious buyers looking for a compact indoor workout option. The foldable design is very convenient for small spaces, and it’s easy to set up and store away. It operates quietly and has adjustable resistance levels, making it suitable for light to moderate workouts.However, it doesn’t feel very sturdy or strong, so it’s best for casual use rather than intense training. That said, at this price point, it’s definitely worth the purchase for its functionality and convenience.I’ll upload pictures soon to show how well it fits into my home gym setup!"
"So, I've been trying to get into shape. 6'3, 245 pounds. Large, but not metal-crushing large (anymore). I'd like to do some cardio that doesn't have me in a gym or outside getting chased by dogs, so I decided to pick up an exercise bike.Honestly? I have no great experience with these things. I just know that I'm on the tall side and that goods often aren't made with that in mind, and I'm large enough that promises like 'Supports up to 300 lbs' matters. But seeing this bike on Prime made me decide to take a gamble. Worst case, I return it, right?Yeah, I won't be returning this, because it exceeded my expectations.First off, it came packed well. No mishaps in shipping, everything arrived solid and undamaged. Credit to the Amazon shipping department and whoever designed the original packaging I suppose. Not that it would be easy to damage. Big, solid, precious few parts.Which leads me to point two. Assembling this was a breeze. I buy furniture online enough that I've picked up a few electronic tools to make assembly and disassembly of such things easier. In this case, I didn't even feel the need. It's just a handful of bolts, nuts and washers to get into place. The included tools are more than enough to do the job right. The key mechanisms are already pre-assembled and self-contained (the wheel or drive or whatever) and just require fixing into place. The instructions are easy enough to follow. This was all finished up easily in an hour or so. The electrical parts were a breeze as well. Just plug things into the other plugs. It's next to impossible to screw up.Now, with that in mind, actually using the bike is the real test. Again: 6'3, 240ish pounds. It's fair to say that me just getting on this bike and using it, period, is a fairly serious stress test of the parts. Also, I've gotten up to 20+ mph while using the bike. In both cases, everything seemed incredible solid, I've already done well over 50+ miles on the bike without issue. At one point I heard the slightest creak from the bars that bike rests on. A couple quick tightening of the bolts and everything was great once again.The electronics also seem decent. I have an Apple Watch Series 8 on my wrist, and I noticed that over time the calories burned seemed to largely converge, so that seems solid. Likewise for the heart rate monitor. Minimal and non-flashy, just like the difficulty controls (it's just a knob). Works extremely well. The seat can be adjusted as well. Bars/handholds seem very sturdy, and I swap between them as I work out.If I had to name any possible downsides, it would come down to two things. First, the 'tablet holder', I suppose you'd call it, is not something I would trust. Too thin for most tablets, and of course that will block the screen/readout, so it seems pointless anyway. I'd never trust a tablet on that small of a surface, it would just end up on the floor. The included drink holder is placed a bit awkwardly, but that seems like an afterthought convenience at most. Finally, actually stepping over the bike can be a bit of a hassle - but that's the case with actual bikes anyway. Gotta mount up one way or the other.Short story is, at this price, with this level of quality, it's turned out to be a great purchase, and I am exceptionally pleased with this. It's now part of my daily routine, and I trust it to get me where I want to go exercise-wise as a guy who just wants to get in better shape, conveniently.One last thing: I had a question that I emailed their customer support over, and they replied instantly and helpfully within 24 hours. Honestly, within 5 hours. That's pretty nice service, as I'm sure people are used to getting zero response or not even having a direct route to contact customer service with their purchase.Long story short, great deal, so far super happy. If that changes I'll update the review, but 50+ miles in so far and we're still golden."
"I rarely leave reviews, but was so pleased with this on day one that I wanted to. While instructions were sparse, it was fairly manageable and quick overall to assemble. I am extremely appreciative of how lightweight this is overall and how it easily folds up well for storage - I live in a pre-war New York City apartment, so space is at a very high premium, haha. I have not worked out regularly in quite a while and was looking for something I could use at home, whether or not I add a gym membership on top of it. I do think the overall body is a little high to swing my leg over, but I’m only 5’4”. (That reason and the instructions are why I took one star off.) The levels of resistance are noticeable enough to provide challenges when you want them.I am extremely impressed with how quiet it is. My floors are old and terrible and my 20 pound cat can sometimes make the boards creak! But this bike is great - it’s so quiet I haven’t even tried it with the mat that I got to put underneath it.Definitely a great purchase and value for this price."
"We purchased this bike based on the strength of reviews, and how we planned to use it - which is basically when we need to train indoors due to weather conditions.  I’ve had the bike for a week, and here’s what I think about it - which is I like it a lot!1) easy enough to assemble.  I’m not very technically oriented, but I didn’t need the videos…just walked through the booklet step by step.  It took me about an hour start to finish.  Pros:  Everything is included - even extra screws if you need something later or something is missing.  Also, you don’t have to find your toolbox for this.  All screws and tighteners are in the package which is well marked and labeled.  Very smart design on that.  Further, some of the screws/nuts are already on the bike parts, so before you think you are missing something, be sure to check the parts you are assembling.  Cons:  Could have used a bit more detail when hooking up the display panel, but it works easily so no real issue there.  Also the pedal foot wrap things weren’t completely specific in the directions, but I looked at the picture on Amazon and figured out how to attach those.  Lastly, the seat had several staples not stapled.  I’m assuming the ones that are stapled will hold up.2) Super Smooth riding.  It’s a cinch to change the level of difficulty and they are clearly marked.  The ride itself is just very clean…nothing shakes or rattles…just peddling!  The display is good if you are measuring those criteria. I’m more of a “set the timer for 15 min and go” kind of rider.  The bluetooth device is coming, so I will see what that does for me.  Pro:  The smooth ride is just very pleasant.  Great for serious exercise or for doing while reading, etc.  Con:  Others have mentioned the “ipad holder” and frankly, it isn’t one.  I would not trust my ipad or phone on that very small shelf. But that is not a deal breaker for me as I can prop my ipad on a nearby table.3) Folds and moves easily.  This takes up very little space unfolded for use, and even less if you want it to be out of sight when not in use.  Pro:  Very compact yet sturdy, if this makes sense.  It feels like it is made well, at least the biking parts of it are.  Con:  Some have said that it’s hard to get on, but I don’t have that problem.  If the bike is unfolded properly, it’s just a matter of lifting a leg and hopping on!4) Bands for arm work:  I love these bands because one of the issues with a stationary bike is “what do I do with my hands?”  This solves that issue by providing an option for working out using the bands.  They aren’t so tight that it’s impossible to do, and they add a nice light tension to the arms while biking.  The handle bars and even the side bars give you plenty of options on where to put your hands.  Pro:  Bands add interest and comprehensiveness to the workout.  Con:  The directions for the arm bands could be clearer, but I accomplished it.All in all, there is excellent value for the money in this bike.  You can even save a few dollars if you’re not too picky about color.  It was shipped quickly and packed well.  Nothing broken or missing in the package.  I hope to be using this bicycle as part of our at-home fitness for years to come."
"It was easy to put together, only took about 45 min's. It is pretty durable and is great for my needs."
"Having read the reviews on this bike, I ordered it, delivery was simple, unpacking was an exercise in space management, it was really packaged tight.  Most reviewers said 1 to 2 hrs, well at 82 yrs old it took me a bit longer, taking breaks.  The instructions were easy to follow as was the hardware, every step was marked out.  The only issue was getting the metal cable connected, it wasn't easy but I got it.  Downloaded the app, and did a 30 minute workout.  The seat was very comfortable.  It's a learning curve with the display functions but all and all this bike represents a good value for the money.  Having used similar bikes  at the gym, this bike is on par with more expensive brand names.  It's also very quiet."
"This was a relatively straightforward build once I got it out of the box.  For some reason, I had a hard time getting everything out.  It was well packaged; possibly too well.  I opened the top first and tried taking everything out but that was difficult so I ended up just cutting the sides.  Once out, the build was straightforward.Everything seems of high quality and lightweight.  Not a big bike which is great.  My wife and I are both under 6' so the compact size is a huge plus.  The lcd is straightforward and simple.  Shows time, pulse, calories, and distance.  Has a holder for your phone or tablet.Overall, excellent basic bike for the price.  The wife likes it very much so that's what counts.  I use it too and like it.  Five stars."
"This is good bang for the buck.  Went together fairly easily, seems to be pretty sturdy, and it's pretty comfortable.  Can't say anything good about the app, i got it connected but subsequent attempts could not find the device, and i could not control the app.  It just would not respond, and I could not find any info on how to actually use the app.  The bike is good, the app sucks.  Note:  I was dissappointed that the resistance was so weak, so I took the cover off the flywheel mechanism (Yes, I had to cut it) and found the flywheel had shifted out of position by more than 1/2"".  (There was evidence that the box got dropped.) Once I adjusted the flywheel to its proper position I had good adjustable resistance and it was quiet."
"Love this machine. Was scared to invest sight unseen but love everything about it so far. I opted for the S23 version.Design: Sleek with bright blue accents. It should be known that the ""wooden"" pedal inset is faux wood.Assembly: Mostly intuitive. The instructions are a bit difficult to read and the parts are not easily recognizable in the diagrams but still simple enough to figure out even without consulting the supplied video. Pro tip: read the pedal stickers. The left pedal screws in backwards.Stability: Excellent. I am 275lbs and even on the highest resistance I only get the slightest sway.Noise level: Extremely quiet. It is quieter than my ceiling fan. The floor boards under the bike make more noise than the flywheel.Fit: Comfortable. I am 5 feet 6 inches and found the adjustments and width of the seat very comfortable. The seat back IS in a semi-reclined position which does not adjust in tilt so if you don't like sitting back while cycling maybe opt for an upright cycle.Exercise level: Good. I am a heavier lady and so have quite strong legs and at the highest resistance it's a trying work out even for me. Very happy that I don't think I'll outgrow this machine any time soon.Bonus: Even my cat has enjoyed working off his kibble!"
"The assembly directions and sealed parts for each step were so easy to follow...the screws should be a little longer as they are hard to engage AND the last step (the handles were a nightmare, had to tip it forward and leave off the spring washer to get it to screw into place).Ok, it's assembled! It is sturdy, a great size, it is quiet and comfortable, I like the display...it's my first piece of exercise equipment and I am so happy with it. I think the price point (it was on sale) was totally worth it.I am looking forward to adding this to my walking routine; it will be great during the winter but its been really nice during this dreadfully hot weather too...I jump on it and watch a little tv with the fan on!I'm just so relieved and happy it is great quality!"
"like the ease of assembly, the quality, the smoothness and quietness of operation and the record keeping of the bluetooth app. Oh, forgot to mention that it is comfortable."
"Product looks and functions as advertised. Product was very expertly packaged and quality details regarding finish, welding, mechanical fasteners and overall appearance is excellent. Frame is sturdy and easily accommodates my 6’2” height, 255 pound weight and 31” inseam. The seat is easily adjustable and equally as comfortable. Electronic module functions intuitively well. The magnetic resistance method works very well and allows the pedals to turn very smoothly. This machine is virtually silent while in operation.I purchased this machine to enhance the recovery of a total knee replacement. I give this product an “A+” and is easily comparable to the $2500 machine used in my rehab recovery clinic. Great job to Merach!Thank you Amazon for offering this at an incredibly affordable price. I placed the order and the product was delivered within 3 days!Now I can complete my therapy and recovery in the comfort of my home.RegardsGFT"
"The bike is well made and performs as expected. It provides sufficient resistance for my needs, to exercise my arthritic knees and provide some cardio. I currently use the #6 setting (out of 8).  I am approximately 70 inches tall. The monitor is very useful to track time and distance and heart rate. The bike was super well packaged, and the assembly instructions were straightforward and required about 90 minutes to assemble.  After a few weeks of use, I am very satisfied."
"I have been searching for an  excercise bike, need to strengthen my leg muscles before knee surgery, and after.  It will be good for weight loss and cardio.  I have hesitated because I wasn’t sure if I could put it together myself (65yr grandma).  After reading the other comments on how easy it was, I said I would give it a go.Let me say I had no issues doing it myself from the instruction sheet provided, took me approx 1.5 hrs alone.  It also has a product code on the outside of the box to scan with your phone camera which will link to a YouTube video if you need visual help.  It comes with a cardboard with the steps 1-6 all separated into nice little squares with  the bolts, spacers and screws all attached in each square for each step! Excellent instructions, both on booklet and YouTube video.Also included are the 2 tools needed to screw in or tighten the bolts.  It has an lcd monitor that shows calories burned, distance, time, pulse rate,.  There is an app to download for your phone, but I have not used it yet.I am 5’5” ,no issues with the length of the pedals and the seat is adjustable and very comfortable.I got it on a great price, it’s a 5*** purchase for sure.  Thank you MerachFor this awesome product."
"Nice bike for the price, but not if you are 6 foot tall. The bike is short by 1 to 2 inches in order to have my legs fully extended. Good thing, the bike is for my wife! The bike was easy to assemble, thanks to good instructions. The bike is sturdy with a comfortable seat and should last a long time. The control panel is a bit cheap, but if you use the app with a tablet it won't matter. The app is ok once you figure out how to use it. You can use Kinomap which is a much better app, but it is costly."
"I bought this bike about a month ago and have used it 5 days per week since it arrived. It was easy to assemble, taking my time and following the directions, it took me two about hours. The parts are all fairly substantial, bolts are heavy duty and well machined. There were no issues putting it together. I am in my early seventies and decided, on the advice of a sports medicine doctor, that it would be good exercise for my aging knees. I am six feet tall and find the bike very comfortable with the seat moved back to its furthest position. It also adjusts easily for my much shorter wife. More expensive bikes have more bells and whistles but this one has everything I require. The elapsed time and distance are what I pay most attention to and as I gradually increase the tension, the heart rate monitor will come in handy. Just in passing, the tension adjustment is really simple. So far,I am really pleased with my purchase; the bike is sturdy and whisper quiet and the only unknown will be durability. At this point,  I don’t detect any issues that would lead me to believe that it will fail any time soon. If your needs are similar to mine, I have no hesitation in recommending this bike."
"Easy to assemble, the assembly parts are grouped by steps which makes it easy. The video for the build steps is also very easy to follow.It is very sturdy , works exactly as a magnetic bike does.Only downside is that it won't be appropriate for taller people. Up to 170 cm is perfect, beyond that not going to work.It is exactly what we needed so it is 5 star for us, if you are taller then 170 would not recommend.Additionally if looking for a high resistance frequent resistance change experience not made for that.It is great for steady cardio with a decent resistance level. Not for a hardcore veteran, very good for a beginner to intermediate."
"Great for snow, dirt or rain. Comfy and pretty light tow wear. Also surprisingly warm for low temperatures."
"I love these boots. Lightweight and so comfortable. Columbia does the best overall for comfort, toughness, tread and flexibility. Bravo."
"These boots are durable, a very comfortable fit and light weight.  Waterproof and love the color."
"fits size 12 okay"
"Columbia hiking boots are my favorite brand.I ordered 10.5 W. However they sent me the size 10.5 ; as a result i returned because I need wide size."
"Bought these because I was going to a beach concert that was expecting a lot of rain. These were extremely comfortable to wear and walk in all day long. They kept the water out as it started raining. My feet were about the only thing dry by the end of the day!"
"These have held up amazing. My feet aren’t cold they’re not falling apart. Comfortable. I will definitely be buying again once I need a new pair."
"This shoes are great.i love them very much and it’s my first pair of shoes from that model, I have another shoes from Columbia.They are very beautiful and very comfortable and lightweight….I really recommend to buy them because you can wear them to hiking or in the city"
"Very good quality shoe. Comfortable, reliable on rough and difficult terrain. Light weight but provide max support and grip required for long and tough trekking. Value for money. Fit as expected."
"I bought these boots for my job, I am a landscaper. The Timberland Men's Mt. Maddsen Mid Waterproof Hiking Boot is a fantastic choice for outdoor enthusiasts. The boots are incredibly comfortable, providing excellent support for long days outside. The waterproof feature kept my feet dry even during wet conditions, and the durable construction gave me confidence on rocky and uneven terrain. The traction is superb, ensuring a steady grip with every step. Overall, these boots combine style, comfort, and functionality, making them a must-have for any landscaper Highly recommend!Money well spent."
"Lightweight but sturdy . Fit true to size . Real leather .Very comfortable and plenty of toe room . Good arch and good sturdy  sole .  Great value ... My husband says the weight of the boot is great ."
"I usually go with mid tear boot brands such as ""Free Soldier"" which have always served me well till last purchase  - out of box they made feet hurt & the darn squeak sound made in heal....sounded like they were filled with water so freaking OCD annoying so it was time for upgrade to Timberland.Timberland boot construction is top notch built to last with real leather , excellent fit ,no foot hurt & no darn squeak sound.Their very good looking as well ,use them for casual wear & out on trails.Their best boots I've ever owned & my new go too."
"I work in an ice rink so my feet can get cold and wet all the time however, these boots are great at keeping my feet warm and dry. They are also very comfortable and fit great as I have a wide foot.Would 100% recommend these boots to anyone.One month update: Not too happy about laces as they are already fraying and one of the tips just failed after one month of wearing 3-4 times a week.## Downgrade from Five stars to Four stars ##"
"Bought a pair of these eight years ago and it seems they haven't messed them up with the version currently available.  Very comfortable to wear and roam around in.  Only issue I have had is walking on wet rocks the traction isn't the greatest and I have fallen because of that.  Fortunately, I don't find myself on wet rocks that often, so these have proven to be decent all around shoes.  Hopefully this new pair will last another eight years."
"I was looking for a light weight boot I could wear while doing work out in the fields. I needed something with full leather to help protect against snake bites but not be heavy. These fit well. My heel is comfortable and secure. There seems to be more room in the foot area but I don’t move around in them. They fit true to size for Timberlands. They are quite aggressive on the bottom and should give great tractions. But the weight is the greatest part. My 6 inch Timberlands weigh 2lbs 1.4 ounces per boot. These weigh 1lb 1.1 ounces per boot. Exactly what I wanted. If you are looking for a light weight, stylish boot, then these are a very good option."
"I live where winter is 6 months out of the year and these boots are so good, I just ordered a second pair. When they mean non-slip, it includes ice. Still take your time on slippery surfaces but the traction is like having winter tires in your feet. And If you’re 6’3, 275 pounds and need a size 13, they are more comfortable AND supportive than any other shoe that I own. I wore out the other pair out last year because they were on my feet almost every moment I wasn’t indoors, for 7 months from October-April. Plus I got to order them in all black this time. 5 out of 5."
"They are waterproof as they claim. The leather lasts. I wore these for two years straight doing yardwork around my house. Rode 60+ miles on a horse in Wyoming, walked in snow and mud and never had a leak or wet feet.I suggest putting some insoles in them just for more arch support because they are a bit flat.Not too heavy and good tread.The rubber toe protector came loose on my first pair, the second pair is fairly new so we'll see.Overall, I would highly recommend. Definitely invest in some foot powder if they're your everyday camp shoes. My feet never got hot but they are waterproof so the ""stink"" stays in the shoe."
"I waited a bit before reviewing so I had a chance to properly test it.  This is the most comfortable hiking boot I have owned.  I even will just wear them when walking the dog around the neighborhood because they are more comfortable than my sneakers and have way more traction on gravel/dirt.  Very happy with my purchase, especially considering the price point.EDIT - DECEMBER 31, 2023:  I had the chance to take these boots with me for a European tour and they continue to impress.  Used them for walking miles on the cobblestone streets and climbing up to the ruins of castles on the side of mountains.  They worked great.  So comfortable I didn't mind using them as my every day footwear for three weeks.  My feet never hurt and they provided good traction on the trails and stones covered in snow."
"I had to up my review for a couple reasons noted in the comments with an * * The customer service is outstanding with this company!!1. Yes, the toe box is a little big, but not a biggie, you can wiggle your toes and still enough room with the socks I've been wearing with them (Carhartt Thermal Wool Socks). * I added a running shoe insole to the top of the insole they have, which makes a phenomenal difference in the feel of the toe box and makes the fit feel a little more secure and snug so you don't feel like the boot is slipping.2. Will they keep your feet warm and dry even when the temperature is -25F? - Dry, so far so good walking in Snow and puddles of water from runoff. * After wearing them in more than ankle deep snow for a while and such, haven't had an issue with wet feet at all... - Warm even when the temperature is -25F ... I very seriously doubt it ... I take my dog for a walk about a mile 3 or 4 times a day, lately in the snow.  The coldest it's been is about 0 degrees F with an approximate -18F wind chill ... they're better than my moderate temperature tactical boots yes, but did they keep my feet warm and cozy ... NO ... took her out a little bit ago at +22F, in the sun and my feet still got cold, especially the toes and bottoms of my feet, with thermal wool socks ... so if you're looking for something that will keep your feet (especially toes and bottoms of your feet) warm at -25F ... these aren't going to do that trick... * After wearing them for a while in cold temperatures ( below zero Fahrenheit with an 18 to 20 below wind chill), then wearing my tactical boots out in the cold ... phenomenal difference ... they seem to keep the feet pretty warm, toes get a little cold but not so much that you feel like your toes are freezing.3. Comfort- They're fairly comfortable, not as much as they advertise ... a lot has to do with the boot laces they use, they keep coming untied ... I typically double wrap my top lace and double tie the loop ... they still came loose.  Think I'm going to make some laces out of some 550 Paracord like I have in the past so they'll stay tight on my feet. * After wearing them for a while, putting the running shoe insole in, they are much more comfortable, still not a fan of the boot laces they come with, but 550 Paracord will remedy that.. üòäThe price was really good (although shortly after I received them the price dropped over $9 üëø**I was in total shock when I received a message from their customer service (Top Shoe) who offered a full refund or they would send me another pair or a different boot to see if I would be more satisfied with those.Upon my request to try a different boot, they sent me a mid-ankle hiking boot (looks similar to this one with a lower ankle and less insulation).I did have to do the same thing, putting in a running shoe insole to make the fit a little more snug and secure.I have to say, after making some slight adjustments (running shoe insoles and Paracord laces), I am thoroughly happy with both pairs of boots.I would imagine a lot of the 'toe box' might have to do with a persons individual foot, it might be perfect for some but need some adjustments for others.All in all, I have to say they are top notch products that appear to be well made and seem as though they'll hold up well.  I've been switching back and forth between the boots depending on the weather and have actually decided that I may very well be looking into purchasing some of their other lines of boots as Spring and Summer approach."
"These boots fit more like a shoe. You can easily drive with them on. They are the most comfortable boot I have worn. I have feet problems with arthritis. There are no rough spots inside. The lining is very soft. The arch is very suportive. The boots are nicely insulated but they don't have too much insulation so you can wear them inside for a reasonable amount of time without getting your feet too hot."
"Just got these boots and they fit well. I haven‚Äôt broken them in yet but seem comfortable. Once it cools down some i will wear them and post any updates here if not satisfied, but I believe they will be fine.I wore these boots on a long walk with my dog today. They fit well and were comfortable to walk in. Still too warm for winter conditions, but I think they‚Äôll be great. The price was right."
"Quality well beyond the price. Warm, comfortable, waterproof with a very comfortable foot bed."
"These were a gift.  He reports that they‚Äôre warm and comfortable and loves that they‚Äôre waterproof. I loved the range of sizes."
"I just received my Nortiv8 boots and they are impressive right out of the box.  They appear well-made, look great, come in a box like in a shoe store, even come with an extra pair of laces.  Putting them on is easy because of the way they open up with laces that are designed to allow you to put your foot in them without twisting and stuffing them in.  I typically wear size 10.5 in my street shoes and bought these in size 11 to have the extra room needed for thick socks and to allow for warm air pockets.  I can wiggle my toes and they are wide enough for my medium width feet to have plenty of room without too much space, and there is no slipping on my heel.  They have a label of waterproof and are insulated with Thinsulate, which will be perfect for winter hiking in the colder, below freezing temperatures, snow and muck on rock trails.  While I believe these will wear and hold up well for my daily 4-5 mile trail hikes, only time will tell.  But on first impression wearing these around the house, I am extremely impressed with the quality and fit of this boot.  I give these 5 stars+ at this point."
"Got a half size bigger. Thinking he would need more room for thicker socks but I didn't.. It's true size. They are warm and keep his feet dry. Got 2 shoe laces. Comfortable to walk long distance"
"They look so clean. Only thing I wish is to that it was more comfortable on the inside but I bough insoles to make them more comfortable other then that clean durable and warm."
"These boots are amazing  quality. Live in novsscotia  ,where the weather  can get crazy. These boots are tough ,comfortable, and warm.I,m very picky about my boots.Finally found  the only boots I will ever own again. Thanks  for such  a great product."
"I recently purchased the Nortiv 8 Men's Winter Snow Boots, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! The boots are incredibly well-made, offering excellent insulation and waterproofing, which is perfect for the harsh winter conditions. They are also surprisingly comfortable, making long walks a breeze.What really impressed me was the delivery service. The boots arrived exactly on time, as promised.The packaging was secure, and the boots were in perfect condition upon arrival.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with both the product and the service. I would highly recommend Nortiv 8 to anyone in need of reliable winter footwear."
"These Boots are very comfortable, didn't have to break them in at all. With all the rain we're having my feet have not gotten wet. They look really nice, and they seem to be made very good. I've only had these boots for a couple of days but if they last for any length of time I will probably buy these again. Also, the fit is accurate to their chart."
"These are great - comfortable, not too heavy but sturdy. I walk 2 miles to & from work each day in NY city and these are by far my favorite shoes. I already bought a backup pair for when these are done. My only complaint is that the tread did wear out a bit quickly (about 10 months) but in all fairness, I do a lot of walking and they are probably designed for dirt & grass, not the concrete jungle."
"I love the fit, comfort, and support this boot provides. I put hard miles on these boots and they hold up well. I do between five to eight miles a day of vigorous hill walking. I am very satisfied with these boots."
"Purchased July 2022 in a rush to take on family vacation so that I could wear/pack just one pair of shoes. Being new, these worked perfectly for casual dining appearance, lounging around the cabins, limited hiking, riverbank fishing, light rain, dirt or mud conditions forecast. I did a minimum amount of online research for the most positive buyer feedback at lowest cost. These were priced at only 89.95 at the time.I've owned several boots and similar casual hikers over 45+ years. They usually start breaking down within 6-9 months. I have fallen arches, plantar fasciitis on left foot, right foot one size wider and shorter than the left, so sizing is often a crap shoot. These fit snug and comfortable enough with decent grip and ankle/foot support right out of the box. No break-in necessary, as others have said. They were subpar, as expected, on the few longer steep, rocky inclines I came across. Just not rigid enough so the balls of my feet and arches tired quickly. They make a GREAT hiker/walker on every other flat or hilly terrain. I liked them enough after vacation to make them my everyday shoe.  I've been wearing these almost every day to work; standing/walking on concrete and asphalt 9-10 hours/day, 4 days/week, and hiking, walking, shopping on days off work for 18 months.They've been warm in moderately cold weather (+10°) and not overly hot in Texas weather. Decent moisture wicking/breathing kept feet pretty dry. The traction/tread did wear enough by 12-13 months to make walking on wet rocks or slippery surfaces overly treacherous but that's better life than most. My heel has worn the lining of both insoles but not all the way through; no uncomfortable folds or lumps underfoot; a welcome surprise given experience with others. The stitching, glue, outsoles have held far better than most! Shockingly, no separations between outsole and footbed. No deep cracks in bottom of soles. Even the toe bumper has not shown any separation.  This suede upper DID show permanent wrinkles on the tops of toe/foot more quickly (1-2 months) than most others but not terribly ugly while wearing, as you might guess from my photos. How these could be called ""waterproof"" being suede with no Gortex or similar layer, I don't know. My waterproof expectations were reasonably low reading the specs, so was prepared for disappointment. They ARE nicely water ""resistant"" in light rain, light snow conditions or even a (very) quick hosing off but with heavy rain or stepping into water the wet and cold is felt in socks and feet within seconds or a few minutes of saturation.My single ""complaint"" is that, for some reason, in my house with these shoes on I am a walking electrostatic lightning rod. To walk from couch a short distance across carpet I must discharge/ground myself before touching or kissing anyone or anything or receive a painful surprise zap! We must have a unique combination of furniture covering, blankets, carpet, otherwise there would be more reviewers mentioning this.As far as care; I hosed them off with any heavy mud or grass stains and brushed them maybe 8 times. There's not much support left in the footbed/soles at this point and they started squeaking when I walk at 14-15 months in but I'm very satisfied with the quality and value I got from them. If I can't find something better, I may purchase again even at the $10-20 higher current price tag."
"I wanted to get a standalone pair of shoes to wear for hiking and walking my doggo. I used to just walk in whatever pair of shoes were on my feet, it could've been some vans, airforces, and they would definitely do the job, but I would end up beating up my shoes more than they deserved.So this brought me to purchasing the columbia newton ridge. I bought the grey and maroon color, and in person it looks quite nice. I've had these now for a few months and have take them on very gravely course terrain, and they have exceeded my expectations.The ankle support is good, and the outsole has very durable lugs built in that provide good traction for various types of terrain.Overall, very happy with my purchase, and highly recommend it!"
"This is a comfortable boot with a good fit for hiking.  The price was so reasonable for a boot of this quality.  Purchased for a trip to Colorado and wore on a hike to the top of Quandary Peak Trail.  The boots felt great."
"These boots fit like a glove right out of the box. Walked several miles in them the same day they were delivered. Like walking on air!Highly recommended."
"These boots are the most comfortable boots I have. They are great for hiking and contractors utility. I have worn down my original tan ones and purchased two more. They are waterproof and have great traction on slick surfaces."
"Product looks great and fits well"
"These boots are very comfortable.  2 day shipping!  They are well made and look great too.  I have tried many brands and these are by far the best bang for your buck.  I had to order the wide in these because I have wide feet and they are plenty wide enough.  I like the quick release lace notches at the top because they make it really easy to lace them to the correct tightness and easy to take on and off.  They have awesome tread on the bottom and are non-slip on all terrain.  They are so comfortable out of the box that they don't need different insoles; I usually put running insoles in all my boots/shoes.  These are my 2nd pair of Nortiv 8 boots.  I liked my Black Nortiv 8 tactical boots so much, I had to have these stylish hiking boots for casual wear.  The black Nortiv 8 tactical boots have held up very well over the last 6 years and I still have them.  These style boots look great and are for everyday wear, work, or hiking.  I love them and I highly recommend these boots!  You can't beat the price on them either!"
"Boots fit good, was very comfortable, the arch support wasn't too big so my orthotics worked perfectly! Too much arch support and my orthotics over correct and my knees hurt. Boots don't feel heavy,  they look good and the price is right! I love the green color too."
"This is the 2nd pair of Nortiv boots I have purchased ""although this is a different style and boot then my previous pair"". So far after a couple weeks of daily use up to 8-9 hours a day at work as a mechanic they have held up great. They do say waterproof however I always coat my boots with a quality waterproofing spray ""as I do all boots, shoes, sneakers..etc"" to give them an added protectant and they stay looking clean and newer for much much longer. My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the laces continue to come undone and you are  constantly having to tie them. Would not be an issue if you double knot them however then they would be difficult to remove at the end of the work day. They are comfortable and have great traction and have kept my feet fully dry ""even when the boots are completely soaked"" and they are fully dry on the exterior the next morning when I'm getting ready for work. I do wish I stuck with just a size 12 and not the 12 wide as they are a bit  to wide ""I usually buy wide if there is an option in the past with no issues"". That being said you can't beat the quality for the price, even if they only last me 6 months in my work environment I would consider it a win and would order another pair."
"I was instantly blown away by the rigidity and ruggedness of these boots, as well as how comfortable and well fitting they are. They are definitely rugged and stiff - in a good way. Very supportive boot and look great too. They feel more like a boot that would cost 2 or 3 times what they do. Very pleased and will be purchasing more form NORTIV 8 ASAP"
"I bought these to replace an old pair of combat boots for doing work around the house. Once I tried these on that plan changed and I am wearing these all the time now. Very comfortable, water- proof, and well made and a great price. Would definitely buy these again."
"I'm a hard core hiker with decades of using a variety of boots with Keen being my favorite, but also expensive.  I saw these on Amazon and after reading good reviews thought I'd give them a try since the price was very good.  Wow, I'm very happy with these boots!  They fit very well and are a bit higher than other boots which I find helpful in keeping rocks and dirt from getting inside the boot.  They have held up over several months of daily use and in wet conditions.  They are light yet strong in supporting your feet and seem very durable.  Highly recommended."
"Nice boot and very well built visually but not as comfortable as I thought.  Bought it based on the reviews of other ""customers"".  There's a part of the tongue that was pressing against my foot that is painful to wear on my left foot.  This is my second shoes from this brand and will be the second shoes I'm returning.  No more buying from this brand.  I hate to buy products and returning it."
"I just spent a week hiking rocky volcanic slopes in Northern New Mexico and fishing streams and lakes in that area, and these boots impressed me! Feet stayed dry and comfortable while other members of the group complained in the evenings of sore feet after climbing up and down steep inclines. Ankle support is good but still allows a bit of flex for enjoyable climbing and hiking. I walked for miles each day (sometimes in rain) on very uneven terrain and never got wet feet or blisters. Multiple trips through shallow water that covered the foot part of the boot proved that the waterproof claim is legit. The soles are softer than older style boots and look and feel more like running shoe soles. I did step down on a few sharp edged rocks descending hillsides that I could feel through the soles, but my feet were always comfortable. A variety of short cactus varieties are scattered on the ground in the area, but I never had spines penetrate the boots or create problems. One evening I stepped into water that was deeper than I thought, and it flooded one boot. I removed the insole and let the boot air out overnight and it was dry enough to wear comfortably for the rest of the week without problems. Even with plenty of abuse and water, the boots are ready for the next challenge. These are the most comfortable ""real"" boots I've worn in a long time, and I will order again when these eventually wear out."
"After reading many reviews and the note on the item page saying that they generally fit to size, I picked up a pair of 9.5 black boots (with some grey trim) as I dig anything in black. If Batman wore a hiking shoe, this would be it. The stitching is well done and the fabric looks great - they don't look poorly made by any means. They appear to be water proof/resistant up to about half-way up the boot, at which point the water would seep in through the top - they aren't hip gaitors or water boots, so I wouldn't expect them to handle much more than a few inches deep puddle/mud. They feel super comfortable underneath my feet and around the sides - nothing awkwardly poking into the arch of my foot or the sides of my ankles. While I did pick my usual size, they do feel *ever so slightly roomy* - but I am wearing super thin socks and if I were wearing a thicker pair, I'm sure the shoe would be filled out a bit more. Also, I feel like if I got a smaller size AND wore a thicker pair of socks, I would find it slightly cramped. Also! Hiking tends to make your feet a bit bigger from the bloodflow so I think it's a good call to settle on a little roomy rather than a perfect fit when you're at home on a couch. I like how easily they go on/come off - you don't have to do much lacing/delacing or do any forcing of your foot into it. You can feel that the sole is made from different materials in different spots - treads are made of a rubber to give you grip where the rest of the sole is made from a harder material to make the soles last longer. Toe cap for a bit of protection/grip/easier ascents. Comes with an extra pair of laces. The photo on the item page does it fair justice but if I get around to pulling out my camera, I'll add a few photos of the shoes before I begin destroying them.All in all - super happy with my purchase and I trust they will serve me well on my thru-hike of the WCT in a month. Thanks for the sick boots, Nortiv8!"
"I have wide feet and they fit perfectly. They have a good grip, are warn and and great looking."
"They are what I was looking for  thankS"
"i’ve now had the Nortiv 8 Men's Waterproof Hiking Boots for a full month, and I can confidently say they have exceeded my expectations. Over the past 30 days, I’ve tested them both indoors and outdoors in a variety of conditions, including sub-zero temperatures (around -5°C), rain, sun, and cold weather, and they’ve handled everything exceptionally well.ComfortFirst off, these boots are incredibly comfortable right out of the box. I had no issues with break-in time, which is a huge plus. The cushioning inside is just the right balance—not too soft, but still supportive enough for long hours of walking. I wore them for several long indoor walks and outdoor treks with no discomfort or irritation. The mid-cut design provides just enough ankle support, while still allowing for good mobility.WarmthOne of the main reasons I chose these boots was for their ability to keep my feet warm in colder weather. And they definitely deliver. Even in temperatures as low as -5°C, my feet stayed comfortably warm and dry. The waterproof lining ensures that snow and slush don’t seep in, which is crucial during cold weather hikes. The insulation isn’t too heavy, though, so I imagine these will be fine for moderate temperatures as well. They strike a great balance between warmth and breathability.Weather ResistanceThe waterproofing has been stellar. I wore them through rainy days, trudging through puddles and wet grass, and my feet stayed dry the entire time. The boots performed just as well in the snow, where the tread gave me excellent grip and traction. The boots have a rugged, slip-resistant outsole that works well on slick surfaces, offering great confidence even when navigating wet or icy patches.DurabilityAfter a month of regular use in a variety of environments, they show minimal signs of wear. The upper material still looks great—no fraying or tears—and the rubber sole has maintained its structure, showing no signs of softening or losing traction. The stitching is solid, and I haven’t experienced any issues with the waterproof membrane.VersatilityI’ve used these boots for hiking, walking, and even casual outings. They’re versatile enough to handle trails, city streets, and even some light climbing. Plus, their stylish design doesn’t scream “hiking boot,” so they look good even off the trail.ConclusionThe Nortiv 8 Men's Waterproof Hiking Boots have really impressed me after a month of wear. Whether it’s enduring cold, wet, or sunny conditions, these boots are comfortable, functional, and durable. If you’re looking for a boot that can handle a variety of environments while keeping your feet warm, dry, and supported, I highly recommend these. They’ve definitely earned a permanent place in my outdoor gear collection.buy them i paied 37 they pop up for 33 from time to time"
"I ordered the Merrell maob 3 mid in 11.5 wide.  The fit was fine, but when I put on thicker socks it was a bit snug.  Changing to 12 wide worked perfectly, it gave me a little more toe room that benefits from thicker socks for fall and winter walking.  Sole of the shoe when walking is slightly firmer than expected, but was mentioned in reviews;  I hope it breaks in a bit and softens up with some miles on them.  Very happy at the price point of just above $100.  Solid shoe and I'm happy with them.Update 08/31/2024.  These are great mid hiking shoes........but I found amazing boots a day later.  Go to REI buy a lifetime membership (30 bucks) and buy something cheap.  Go back after 24 hours and buy a set of Danner 600 leaf GTX hiking boots for men (grizzly brown/Rodeo Red) and get $30 off.  My boot code was ""62302"".  They are on sale until September  2nd 2024 for $164, but if you get a member card and use it 24 hours later, you get lifetime membership and $30 off and you get these AMAZING  boots for 132 and tax.  If you have 11.5 in 4EE feet you will thank me later.  If you have narrower feet stick with the maob 3 mids for half the price.  I bought a pair of Danners 20 years ago and they are still amazing.  No shade for the Merrell Moab 3, but for a wide foot the 62302 Danner is like a silk slipper. OMG I love these boots, I am so sorry Merrell......... but I found true love."
"Just a great boot! Light, comfortable and well made. I‚Äôve had several pairs of these and each one has been perfect fit."
"These hiking boots are incredibly comfortable and provide excellent support. They have been tested them in wet conditions, and they truly are waterproof, keeping my husband‚Äôs feet dry throughout the hike. The grip is solid, even on rocky trails, and they feel durable enough for many adventures. A must-have for any hiking enthusiast!"
"Loved everything about these boots including the color, durability, easy to break in, decently lightweight and comfortable. Only negative is after a long hike feet felt quite warm, little ventilation but thats probably with most hiking shoes"
"The Merrell brand was recommend to me by a friend. I had never heard of Merrell before. I received these boots just 5 minutes ago and put them on immediately.I purchased the ""Earth"" color (brown) and the boots look real handsome! I don't see any obvious flaws and they seem to be sturdy and very well-constructed. However, I will need to wear these Merrell boots exclusively for the next few months to see if anything defective develops.SIZE INFO: I usually wear a size 10 or 10.5, depending on boot/shoe manufacturer. My friend recommend that I size-up just a little when purchasing this Merrell boot. Good Advice!I think at least one reviewer said that these boots run very large. This is NOT true in my case. I purchased size 10.5 M and they fit absolutely perfect.The boots are quite comfortable and have noticeable arch support.Although only extensive use of an item like this (clothes, shoes) really determines their durability and value, at this point I rate these Merrell boots 5 stars.Regarding Waterproofing:I always spray my suede/smooth leather boots and shoes with the common silicone boot waterproofing spray. It protects the leather and makes it last longer. Reapply every year.I recommend these boots."
"I hesitated before buying these, as I had a pair of low Merrells that were not comfortable nor waterproof.  I I was a faithful Timberland buyer, but they have really cheapened their boots. So, I finally broke down and bought these as they come in a wide width and were rated fairly highly on several different ""best of"" reviews. They were comfortable right out of the box. Wore them to mow very wet grass and feet remained dry (only time will tell how they fare in Adirondack weather). I also wore them on a hike into a remote lake up north, good traction and protective footbed. The price is moderate, there are cheaper boots, but these seem pretty rugged in comparison. I hope to get several years out of them."
"I love these boots for the summer months. They are waterproof but handle the heat very well. They are light weight and comfortable for racking up miles quickly in."
"I've been wearing Merrell Mid hiking shoes since 2016. My previous two pairs were Moab 2, and I've been very happy with the wear, fit and waterproof qualities. Right out of the box, I noticed that the Moab 3 looks to be even sturdier then the Moab 2. The sole has a more aggressive tread and the toe and heel are more reinforced. The fit is sturdy and the insert seems to have a more significant arch support. I read some reviews reporting that the sizing runs a little small, and I notice that they seem to fit snug, but that might be because they are new.Some reviews report that they are not waterproof; as of this writing, I haven't had an opportunity to test that facet. I don't use Merrell's for necessarily just hiking, but more of a daily wear during the colder seasons and inclement weather (although I do occasionally hike with these). They have always been very comfortable, so I am looking forward to the Moab 3. I will update this review, once I have experienced wet conditions and after a break-in period."
"This is the fourth pair of these hikers from this company I've bought over the years. I walk on average 1000 miles a year in the forest and get the best life out of these over any other like product. Very comfortable at any temperature for me from +95 down to -30. Haven't found anything yet that would make me change."
"So have worn the Newton Ridge Plus for some 10 pair or so.  If memory serves they were just Newton Ridge (non Plus) for the first few pair, but that was some time ago!  I keep buying them as they do it all right. Waterproof, Support, Last a year of ~10K steps / day.  My go to work, play and away boot.I actually got this pair for a workmate that had gotten boots from a local big box and the sole broke after 3 months, twice in a row.  I could not take it anymore and had to get him a real pair of boots.  He's doing fine in these.  You probably would too.I don't have a break in period with these.  They feel comfortable and work right and can be worn to work the day you take them out of the box."
"These shoes feel fantastic!  They are very true to size, and they fit me just perfectly.  The craftsmanship and design look wonderful, and I haven't seen or experienced any issues with them so far.  I ordered these as hiking boots, and possibly as winter boots, but they look so nice, I kind feel bad about possibly scuffing them up!The support around the ankle area seems adequate to me, but I immediately removed the insoles from these shoes.  They're just thin pads, and although they were comfortable, they didn't provide the arch support I wanted.  I had some high arch insoles that slid right in, and now I'm ready to go.  I tend to overpronate, especially with my left foot, due to a prior injury, but with the insoles in these, and the added support around the ankle, these should be just great for me!Awesome quality, stylish appearance, and a great value, in my opinion!"
"This is my second pair. They fit my foot perfectly. My job requires me to stand all day. These boots are way more comfortable than tennis shoes. Secondly, I wore them hunting and they are way better than the $300 to 500 huntimg boots. They handle walking on rocks better than Merril hiking shoes. For the price, These are amazing shoes. Im buying a third pair now."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



TLDR: Tongue is a bit water resistant, outsole has soft rubber (potential durability issues), eh plastic coated leather, comfortableThe important thing to note is that this shoe is not a workhorse boot. If you were planning to wear this for an everyday 9-5 warehouse job, serious hikes often, or for labor work every other day, this shoe isn't for you. While the shoe is decent, it lacks the longevity that you want in a workhorse shoe. It does work in a pinch, but expect the outsole to wear out quickly and with the poor quality PU coated leather, don't expect much. But if you want a comfortable water resistant boot that you wear for the occasional hike, around town for whenever it rains, or just for casual house work, this boot is quite good.Build: The shoe, in terms of build, it is alright. The leather is not soft and supple, but more of the quality you would expect from shoes around its price range (plastic coated non top grain leather). The outsole and midsole are cemented onto the body of the shoe, which does limit its longevity but it does make it waterproof when compared to if you stitched them. I am a bit worried about the outsole, which is made of a softer rubber. While this does make it grippier, this limits its longevity as well. Its soft enough where you can slightly bend/move the tread with your thumb, mostly in the parts with thinner tread. The places where you loop your shoelaces are made of metal, probably aluminum or similar. Shoelaces are alright, maybe won't last as long as you would want for a boot, but workable. There is a moderate amount of padding around the sides of your ankle and on the tongue. There is some polyester mesh like but tighter woven lining in the entire interior of the shoe to make it more comfortable. Overall pretty average.Stability:If you tie the laces tight and use all the lace loops, it has decent stability. I tried intentionally roll my ankles and it definitely helped. I'm not sure how it would handle if I was carrying something heavy though. It has a rigid heel counter to help keep your foot in. Overall decent.Comfort:Honestly a very comfortable shoe. It feels closer to wearing a light boot instead of a heavy duty boot. I liked that the insole and midsole conformed to your foot a bit and isn't too soft or too hard. If you use your thumb to push the insole and midsole from inside the shoe, it gives a little bit but then gets too hard if you try to push further. The shoe is also fairly light for a boot. Significantly heavier than a sneaker, but not up to the level of a heavy duty boot. I could imagine myself wearing the shoe often and walking in them for a while.Waterproofness:The shoe is definitely waterproof in the leather parts but the tongue I was worried more about since it mesh. The tongue is gusseted up to the first hook (or right after the 4 triangles for the laces). The gusset was designed to not pool any water and to make the water flow downward toward your toes. I wouldn't say the tongue is waterproof, but is a bit water resistant. I wore the shoe in light to moderate rain outside. I checked the weather and it was around 0.04 to 0.09 inches of rain per hour during the time I conducted the test. I made sure not to cover the shoe with anything and stuck my leg out into the rain diagonally. The shoe was basically in the rain without my upper leg or body blocking the rain. After 17 minutes or so, I finally noticed some dampness inside the shoe where the tongue connects to the shoe upper. In the upper parts of the tongue, when I squished the tongue from the outside, I noticed that the inside went from dry to damp. This means that the tongue is some water resistant mesh or soft shell  and that water will soak through with enough time in the rain. This also means the tongue is breathable. In the vid I poured maybe 2 cups of water onto the tongue (vid only showed 1 pour) and the shoe was still dry inside. I think with an umbrella, the shoe will be water resistant enough for your casual needs in continuous rain for the day. Its weakness is continuous direct water keeping the tongue saturated. I also think it will be fine if youre quickly crossing short streams or puddles once in a while and letting it dry out after before doing it again. It should be probably fine if youre going from your car to your house, to work, maybe 5 blocks, or any short journeys without an umbrellaI do not think this shoe will keep you dry if you are walking a lot without an umbrella. Or if you do have an umbrella but a significant portion of the rain is still hitting your shoes because of your height or wind and you are walking for longer distances. At that point you might as well either wear a gaitor that covers the tongue, super breathable shoes that dry quickly, a full rubber rain boot, overshoes, or waterproof socks"
"So let's get this out of the way these are hiking boots... These are not work boots... I'm about 97% sure that they are real leather... So they can make your feet smell... They are extremely comfortable. They have great traction.But ultimately once again they are not work boots.This means that the sole is simply too soft and too thin to last very long on raw concrete or asphalt... Once again it's not what they were meant for.I used mine in a mixture of tile floor and sidewalk concrete. Not surprisingly. They did not last very long before the heel wore out... Not the boots fault not Columbia's fault. They are just not work boots...Love, the gray, beautiful looking boot actually."
"Can't beat Columbia's blend of comfort, style, functionality & price. I commute via train downtown for work then have to talk a mile round-trip. These expertly handle the slick city-scapes if it's raining, snowy or icy. And yes--they are waterproof. Should keep your feet dry so long as you're not trudging through 6 inches of snow or stepping in giant puddles. They also look the part once I get into the office which in important where I work. Highly recommend!"
"I really love this brand. The boots are very comfortable and very light. The materials are really of excellent quality. I have had several colors but in black they look very pretty. I will buy this brand again even above the one from the little tree, highly recommended."
"These are super lightweight and fit very well right out of the box. They are also waterproof !"
"Tested these boots extensively - 3 weeks of backpacking in Vietnam. From hiking in the mountains, walking in cities, riding scooters...they're very comfortable boots. Great fit.The only complaints I have are:(1) Slippery soles when wet. That's a huge negative for me. They need to use a better compound.(2) Metal lace hooks are soft and will bend. They won't bend when you tie laces, but sometimes the boots catch on each other when you walk, or they catch on debris in the bush. I expect better hardware for the price paid.(3) Right boot now squeaks a bit. Not a big deal to me, but could be annoying for other customers who buy these boots."
"Perfect"
"High quality great price point. Strong support, great for mild to cold days. Love the colour."
"I bought these as a backup pair to take on a week long trip. I wound up wearing these more then my regular boots, comfortable and light weight."
"These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned.  I bought them for hiking on damp mornings and in wetlands.  They’re perfect for that - warm, dry and very stable.  But, after less than a week of owning them, I want to wear them everywhere all the time.  (So much so that just went ahead and ordered another pair of keens with a low top.)  It did take a me a few days to adjust to the higher top as I usually don’t wear a mid-top shoe - but needed one for hiking during foliage as it get slippery out there - but the insoles were perfect from day one.  Can’t say enough great things about the design - that wide toe box PLUS heel lock is real so you don’t feel like you’re sliding all around inside them or have to tighten the laces as far in as they go as happens in the some other zero-drop wide toe box shoes."
"These are comfortable, sturdy, light weight, & make my big feet look great. They run a tad small though so order half a size up."
"I bought these specifically to walk my dog on wet days but have found myself wearing them frequently.  As others have said the fit is great with an ample toe box. They also have enough wiggle room for either regular socks or thicker socks; either way they are comfortable and keep my ankles stable. From the first day I wore them, when we walked about 4 miles, I've had no discomfort whatsoever.  I may order another pair just to have when these ones wear out!"
"I have had them for a couple weeks and walked about 10 miles in them trying to break them in and get used to them.  1st issue: the toe box is actually not particularly wide. Coming from a pair of Altra hiking shoes, my feet definitely feel cramped. But I was also spoiled with that toe box, so I was willing to overlook that. It's definitely wider than a pair of Merrells. 2nd issue: The right boot has started making a crinkling sound, like the glue is dried out and bad.  3rd issue:  The left boot has a weird seam right above the pinky toe that is rough and creates blisters.  This is not in the right boot. The right boot feels awesome, just makes a weird sound.  For the money, I would have liked a sturdy pair of boots that didn't cause blisters.  I think Keen needs to tighten down their manufacturing. The fact that two boots in the same pair to have two very different problems, is concerning.I have a hiking trip coming up that I don't have time to break in a new pair for, So I'm going to wrap my foot, bring some extra glue, and my old Altras for backups. Fingers crossed these hold up in the New Hampshire white mountains.**UPDATE** I took these boots with me to climb Mt. Washington. I wore them as much as possible in the days leading up to the hike.  After about 15 miles of wear, they FINALLY were broken in.  It was like a switch flipped and they're super comfortable hiking boots now. The weird seam is no longer poking out, and the toe boxes loosened up. They served me quite well on Mt Washington. The soles were super grippy and worked well on wet and slushy rock. When we got into the compacted ice, i added Microspikes and the boots felt very stable with those on as well.  I've had hiking boots where spikes felt weird, but felt fine on these.  Updating to 4 stars, because I'm still not totally sure about the glue on the one boot. I took it to a bootery and they said it was fine, but without removing the sole they couldn't be 100% sure.I recommend these IF you have the time to break them in THOROUGHLY before your adventure."
"These boots stay clean even in wet grass, have comfortable support, and are high quality. They fit true to size and are easy to lace up in terms of functionality. Love them!"
"I had no breaking in period. Wore these right out of the box on long hikes in Iceland. Kept my feed dry through shallow streams, no slippage up or down hills. I usually have problems with my toes hitting the front of shoes when going down hill but these kept my foot in place so no issues there."
"I was recommended these hiking boots by my parents because I was heading to Costa Rica. I bought them back in April 24’. I used them multiple times for good lengths of time over several different terrains to break them in. I even wore them to Disneyland to walk ten miles in. Every time I wore them my feet felt like they would fall apart. So uncomfortable that I ended up purchasing inserts to put in them. Fast forward to June during my trip. I wore them on the hikes through the rain forest and let me tell you I did not feel confident in them keeping me stable one bit. I was constantly focused on where to step in fear of losing the grip. They were great to protect my feet and ankles from critters but that was it. Two days ago I was walking around the main city and had my hiking sandals on, walked 4 miles and felt great but it was starting to rain and the streets can get a little slick. I decided before heading out on a walking food tour to switch to the boots to help keep me from slipping. They did the OPPOSITE! I can’t count how many times I felt the shoe slip as I walked. Ultimately I ended up slipping and unable to save myself. I fell hard on my knee resulting in a giant slice and scrape. I couldn’t go back and change because the tour had started. So I’m walking through the city with bloody knee and walking for another 4 miles before finally making it back to the hotel and my feet were literally screaming. The tops of my feet were so strained, the bottoms hurt and I got a large blister on one of my toes (which I hadn’t gotten one yet). I would’ve felt safer in the hiking sandals and more confident in not slipping/falling. I one hundred percent wouldn’t purchase these again nor recommend them."
"I bought these to replace an old pair of Keen hikers that I absolutely loved, but they had served their time and were ready to be replaced.  I can't remember if they were Targhee's or not, but from what my husband and I can tell, these are the boots that were most similar to my last pair.I jumped on this pair because the price was awesome, compared to ordering directly from Keen!  They have the classic Keen wider toe box, which is perfect for my wide, size 8 feet.  I ordered an 8, and they fit perfectly.  I wore them for a day on my daughters field trip, and I can't really say that they needed to be broken in, they were just comfy and a perfect fit from the get-go.  I also wore these hiking this summer in Alberta and BC, and they were amazingly comfortable.  I highly recommend if you're looking for a hiking boot with a nice wide toe box and you don't want to have to break them in!"
"It was my first time to purchase KEEN hiking shoes, after I tried it in heavy trails , I love it ! I think I'll consider KEEN one of my favourite brand in hiking shoes."
"The shoes fit my size perfectly and are light, tough, and comfortable."
"Bought these for hiking on trails in Arizona. Used them for 5 days in a row and they were fantastic! They were the most comfortable option in this price point and seemed like a great value for the money. Highly recommend!"
"Sturdy boots and sufficient wide cut. Meant to take a beating. Ofc, it is a shoe for 60.-, dont expect it to be on the same level as a high end product.It is comfy and the sizing is true to the chart.I nor ally wear a 13 but buy a 14 bc of the thicker socks I wear. This shoe would have been enough in 13 tho…"
"As a mail carrier who walks 12 miles a day, I like these boots. Long lasting comfort and solid waterproofing"
"Great shoes!  I wore them all around Alaska and they are very comfortable and warm.  I went up one size to allow for thicker socks and it worked like a charm.  I would buy these again!"
"Just received.. looks great and will post update as soon as they worn to see how they function."
"Looks great, feels great till you get water on them. I bought these for a BWCA trip and was expecting them to be waterproof. A bit of water already gets absorbed easily, thus resulting in wet toes, not exactly a plan for a multiple day camping trip with wet boots. Save your money and get an expensive pair. Do not recommend if you plan to be near water."
"time will tell, but for now they are very comfortable and my feet are dry after walking through park in heavy dew."
"Very comfortable"
"Love these mid top trainer/ boots , great support for my ankles  , so comfortable have worn my first pair out"
"They fit true to size, and seem durable. I haven't had a chance to put them through the ringer yet but have done lots of standing for hours in them and some walking. I have flat feet and they didn't hurt *too* bad after. Tread and grip seem to be pretty decent on uneven and loose terrain.The ankle support style they have going is odd, they grip your ankles pretty firmly. I'm assuming over time it kind of stretches or loosens, but for now it is a bit uncomfortable.Breathability seems ok. I'm in Arizona but got these just as the triple digit weather ended, but I haven't felt like my feet were swimming. However the goretex is obvious as my feet were noticeably warm.Tldr, grippy, kinda warm, ankle support is incredibly smug, objectively breathable, also kind of funny color combo"
"A little big on fit. Not bad thought at all if you wear warm winter socks! The Gore Tex waterproofing and insulator, are as always, on point. No water leaks in snow or creek. Feet stayed warm, but not hot or sweaty. Perfect. They are by far the lightest hiking boots I’ve ever worn, and comfortable is an understatement! Definitely have recommended Solomon brand to family and friends. Great boots, and not as expensive as other “top shelf” winter hiking boots!"
"So far very comfortable and holding up to my expectations.  Time will tell if these boots can make the grade or not."
"I have not been impressed with Solomon boots recently (2023).  The quality has been suspect on almost every boot I've tried.  But with these, my faith has finally been somewhat restored.  These are by far the heaviest Salomon boot I've tried, but they are secure and comfortable after you break them in (but they do take a while to break in -- depending on how much hiking per week you do)."
"I gave these boots five stars in spite of my criticism for their durability, because I'm not sure if any other boot would last this long. For context, I do boxing exercise in the morning, am on my feet all day for my job, frequently run five miles at the park, and also exercise at night. I have been wearing only these shoes for all of these activities. They also get soaked with sweat so every morning and night I have to use a boot dryer. I initially started using hiking boots for all my exercise, including running, because my coach said it would help relieve my knee pain, which it did. Unfortunately I am beating the absolutely crap out of these shoes, and after writing all this down, realize that it's a miracle they survived this long! 😂Also you can see where I used waxed thread for sewing leather to repair where the shoes have started coming apart. Same on the other boot. Also, worth noting I had this happen on my previous pair of Salomon boots that I used when I was at the Postal Service where I walked around all day (but didn't run or do exercise in them). That pair lasted significantly longer but ended up tearing in the exact same spots. However, the soles of the current pair still have a lot of life in them which is why I've repaired them."
"I do some really rugged trekking and work in hilly bushy land. Sometimes wet, muddy and slippery ON CLAY! Yuck clay. Yuck 15lbs of mud on each boot. Slow, In the rain. Dark. Holding stuff, going nowhere fast. Yuck clay.Anyway, Quality top notch! My bush resilience is partly based on the toughness of this boot. I’m fairly remote and can’t take careless chances. Using heavy brush cutters and chainsaws on steep slopes for hours is serious work - it requires your full attention - the ankle support is absolutely essential. The trakky grip sole is essential. The added bonus of being lightweight is essential. I can’t say enough how much I value this piece of footwear. Sometimes I’m like a Sherpa, carrying anywhere between 30 and 70lbs on shoulder, up and down hills. I will never work without it - galoshes? Wellies, neoprene, rubber boots, whatever they’re called are for flat land, washing a car or something like that.These are the boots that can get you in and out of anything - with or without load. It’s a vital piece of survival/work gear. If I don’t have these to get into the action… nah, will just stay home! bought a second pair kinda for dry weather. The waterproof didn’t really hold up somehow by 3rd year of use. Dammit they’re good!"
"I work with water a lot. I work on pools. These boots have had yet to see the worst. And already gave up. There was some clear signs. Something was wrong. I continued my day and then it took a turn for the worst. At first, it felt like I had bubbles somewhere inside the shoe. I could feel them squirt and move around every time I took a step, but my foot was dry however, this was concerning. And then later, I was standing maybe one or 2 inches in a puddle working and my shoes filled with water. Water is not splashed on them. These have sustained no damage. I’ve had these three days of walking and working and they’re already useless."
"I wanted a good hiking boot to look at on the floor by my door that I wont use enough  :P  These fit great and feel really good. Love the way they look as well.My only isue is one of the shoelaces is shorter than the other so its harder to tie that one.  Over all I love them.  I only gave a 4 on comfort as I havent broken them in fully yet and my feel do hurt after wearing them for a while.  Im thinking once I get used to them and they conform to my feet that should get better"
"My boyfriend started a new job and needed designated shoes to be left at the greenhouse. He's very picky with his shoes, both in looks and comfortability. He decided to go with these based of good reviews, looks, and price point. They've held up well in the greenhouse environment. His feet stay dry. He talked about how comfortable they were, even on day one. They fit true to size. Definitely consider these if you work in a greenhouse!"
"Size is true to form , nice and waterproof , traction and grip is Very good is slick conditions."
"These are really nice hiking boots. I am a big fan of Adidas foot wear and have the low sneakers just like these and always buy last years' style, since these are generally at half price and the current ones are about 200 now, I am not cheap, but why pay that much for the same shoes, with slightly different styles. The treads are good for climbing up the slopes.We do lots of hiking in Sedona and Tucson, these have good traction and comfort for long hikes and the high tops provide more ankle support. I wear 11.5 and these were just a perfect fit at 11.5. Sometimes I end up buying 12's in Adidas shoes, but these fit just fine."
"Well made, soft and very comfortable!Price $20. More than they should be.Should have been priced at $59. Not $79.Time will tell if they hold up, nice boot for winter, climbing and hiking!"
"Love these shoes, live in Wisconsin and they are excellent for winter conditions. I really like the high ankle support for uneven terrain. Grip is excellent in frozen and slippery surfaces. Would recommend."
"Warm, comfortable and good looking.  They fit perfect."
"After reading all the reviews, a lot of people said to order up a size. I usually wear a 7 in men’s sneakers, so I ordered the 7.5. I wish I would have just ordered the 7, because these are a little big for me. I’m a little disappointed, because I like them, but they’re a little big and I don’t know if I can really return them now, or exchange them for the smaller size.They are well made, have good traction and a nice sole. They are a little difficult to get on and off, but that’s most likely because of the way that they are laced. Plus, I have to have them laced pretty tightly because they’re a little big for me.They are nice, though. Cool kicks. Not sure about waterproofness, but they are sturdy and comfortable."
"Comfortable, ideal for walk and stand for many hours. Quality materials and slip resistance."
"These boots are a literal LIFESAVER and can withstand ANYTHING.My little brother impulse invited me to go hike an active volcano in Guatemala 4 days before departure and these boots got me through that TWO-DAY, FIFTEEN HOUR HIKE - which was so steep, you’re basically walking horizontally, directly up for 14,000 METERS!! Where you also hike through the terrain and weather of FOUR DIFFERENT CLIMATES, beginning with blaring sun and ending above the clouds in brutal wind and freezing temperatures - all while trudging through nonstop mud, rock, sand, ash, rainfall, and gravel so loose you’re taking 2 steps up and sliding 1 step back!Bought these 2 days before we left. Wore them around while packing, etc. so never really broke them in but it didn’t matter. My feet stayed dry, warm, and comfortable literally the entire time, and I had ZERO blisters at the end of it. Not a mark! I may never walk again but that’s no fault of the boots!! They held up PERFECTLY! And matched all my outfits :)Some cute English guy in our group even asked if they were “designer” because he liked them (lol). Also, I’m shocked at the price, STILL. These should honestly be 5x more expensive for what you’re getting - and after all that, they still somehow look good.Telling you, these boots saved me. Can’t even imagine what that hike would have been like without them being everything they needed to be! I have no complaints. They are perfect. I love them. And you will too.me: got the beige ones with the brown/cream/blue heel accent in a size 6, true to size - these boots are ALL weather proof, for real.(the last pic is post-one week in Guatemala and that crazy hike .. I ended up wearing them like the whole time - so also rode 4Wheelers in them, while walking around town, airport, etc.! Still haven’t cleaned them even though they were completely covered in dirt and sand and mud after the hike ..but somehow don’t look that dirty lol)"
"I got these for a trip and they were perfect. They are kind of hard to slide and the shoelaces are hard to pry apart to loosen. But once they’re on they are super comfortable. I love the flannel lining it’s really soft. I am flat footed so it’s more on the flat side and not much of an arch in the boot. I got an 8.5 which is what I usually wear and it works perfected. Plenty of toe space. I love the color options in got the light brown. The boots do make some noise from the running of the leather but it improves over time. Took a bit of time to break in. They are great boots for a great price!"
"These shoes are super cute for hiking shoes! They’re soft on the inside, but not too hot to wear in the summer. They’re waterproof and durable. They even have some cushion in them for extra comfort! The laces are not too complicated. The sides rise up enough for ankle support. They are super light weight compared to other hiking boots. I usually wear between a 6-7, so I ordered a 6.5. They fit a bit snug, so I probably should have ordered a 7. But even snug they’re not super uncomfortable and should break in after wearing them a couple more times. Overall, these are a good value for the money spent."
"I like the way the boots look - very stylish and modern. I plan to wear them in light snow and to hike. They are very warm and comfortable and because they are waterproof, I will be able to wear them in different types of weather."
"I'm so happy with this purchase. They may run slightly big or ""roomy"" but I like that I am able to wear thick socks with them. The inner lining material is very sold. Sturdy soles with great traction on ice. At this price point, I highly recommend!"
"Bought these boots for hiking. Put them on to try and Love it!!! Super comfy and very nice looking. A but squiky since I wore just for an hour. Aso warm and cosy. I think I will get another pair for hiking. These are perfect for fall/ winter I am in CA. Sprayed with water resistant  sprsy to keep clean and mud free.Highly recomended!"
"Boots were fine and comfortable.  I have bigger fingers so I would like if the pull tab had a little wider finger hole.  And also after walking in them all day they did stain my white socks with some orange and gray marks, not all over but some."
"Bought these to work on hurricane recovery in NC. Brand new they were comfy, needed about a week for break-in and, yes - they SQUEAKED (pic 1). A little baby powder under the laces on top of the tongue fixed the squeak. The boots went through a lot of muck, serious terrain, rain & snow for 5 solid days (pic 2), but a little stiff bristle brush & they came out great (pic 3, color chg due to different lighting). My feet were always warm, dry & comfy, and I never slipped regardless of the conditions. I bought these because of the rating and at this price wasn't a loss if they didn't survive. Now, I plan to buy another pair when these wear out."
"Well finishing good quality"
"These fit well and as expected as far as size goes.I like the skecher brand. What has been challenging with these shoes is the grommets haven't been the best.The same pair of shoes right and left, looking down, top left through grommet pulled loose (3rd down, left side). I found some great glue and along with a clamp and a couple of tries, I've been able to keep using these shoes. I ordered a 2nd pair and have used this pair only while letting the glue cure. So far, so good. You can also see the 2nd pic shows a different shoe string. It happens.I wear these shoes every day. I usually go through shoes, so 8 months, even with repairs, is ok.I hope they get the grommets sorted.As far as the seams, no gaps or tears which is surprising given the grommet issue. Very pleased with this part of the build.Wear pattern has been. Looks even after 8 months, your wear may vary. But quite a bit of rubber left and even.The metal ""waterproof"" badge is silly. Broke off the left fairly early, the right is still hanging on by one.As far as waterproof goes, I guess they are fine, I have not paid attention to this piece as I didn't buy them to be water proof. But if the grommets are going to come off, make your own assumptions.They are comfortable and stay relatively cool while moving around. Sitting still will warm up as expected.I may actually make it a whole year with these shoes with a little more grommet glue which will honestly be the first time in 35 years.I've built a kitchen pantry, removed windows, installed a patio door in our house. I have also made a rental property ready to re-rent... A lot more effort and quicker. I have done oil changes and added a lift to my truck and much more. These shoes have been through a lot of torment and have held up, with just a little glue to help."
"I recently purchased the Skechers Men's Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots for my son-in-law, and I must say these boots have proven themselves to be a reliable and resilient choice for outdoor adventures. Specifically designed for hiking and light rock climbing, they showcased their exceptional performance during a challenging trek.Right from the start, it was evident that these boots were built to endure demanding terrains. The sturdy construction and durable materials instilled confidence that they would withstand the rugged conditions encountered during the hike. My son-in-law took on 15 miles of trails and conquered numerous rough rock faces, and these boots held up admirably, demonstrating their impressive durability.Comfort is paramount during long hikes, and the Skechers Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots excelled in this aspect. They remained consistently comfortable throughout the entire hike, ensuring that my son-in-law's feet stayed cozy and supported. The boots' design incorporates features that cushion the foot and provide ample arch support, contributing to a fatigue-free hiking experience.It's worth noting that my son-in-law took the precaution of wearing these boots daily for a week before the hike to break them in. This step allowed him to acclimate to the boots and ensure a comfortable fit. However, the boots' performance during the actual hike was exceptional, and their durability and comfort were evident even without an extended break-in period.The Skechers Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots offer exceptional value for their quality. Their performance, combined with their reasonable price, makes them an excellent investment for outdoor enthusiasts. Knowing that these boots held up impressively during a demanding hike gives us confidence that they will continue to deliver in future adventures.In summary, the Skechers Men's Relment-Pelmo Hiking Boots surpassed our expectations, proving to be a reliable and resilient companion during an arduous trek. Their durability, comfort, and ability to withstand rough terrains make them a smart choice for outdoor enthusiasts. Once my son-in-law wears out his current pair, we will undoubtedly be returning to Skechers for another remarkable hiking boot experience."
"I ordered a 10 Wide but received a 10 Extra Wide. I was going to return them but after a little thinking I decided to keep them and give them a whirl. I have a tendency to blow out the little toe area on the right shoe thus the wide order. But, not with every brand or shoe, I still sometimes wear out the little toe area even with a wide so I decided to keep these Extra Wides. I added a cheap pair of cushioning insoles and since winter is coming upon us I figured with heavier socks and the insoles that these just might work out alright. I have only had them for about 3 weeks now and did a grueling hike up and down ravines for about 3 hours and have worn them casually a couple of other times, 4-5 hours at a time. My initial thoughts right now is that these will work. They are very comfortable and lighter than a coupe of other pairs of hiking boots that I own. On my first hike I did end up walking through about ankle deep of water that was in a creek and as advertised, they kept my feet dry. How long the waterproofing will last is still yet to be determined because every other waterproof boot I have owned lost its ability to keep my feet dry after a couple years. I didn't want to just jump in and give them 5 stars yet since I have only had them a few weeks but will try and update this review after this hunting/hiking season comes to an end early January. I should have worn them enough by then to give an honest updated review."
"They fit great and are very comfortable to wear.  I'm on my feet 12+ hrs a day and walking alot and they feel great"
"My feet were designed for Skechers shoes. Have bought many pairs and all were comfortable and long wearing. Will continue to buy..  Being water prof is a positive feature, and they look good."
"These shoes were so useful I wore out a pair and bought them again years later.  The uppers are tough enough to protect my feet during nature walks.  They look great.  The fit is comfortable, with a wide-enough toe box."
"These are some really nice boots and really comfortableThank you for a quality pair of bootsüëç"
"I'm not kidding, the boots are so very comfortable, they feel like slippers. They are new so a complete review is hard to do at this point, but I may come later if they disappoint.  But at the moment, I highly recommend them.  The size is true, the bottom grip seems quite adequate, very please with this purchase!"
"Great price, very light and comfortable."
"I really hate buying shoes because I am 100% about comfort and functionality.Straight out of the box, I considered returning them because they just felt light and a little too roomy. But I ended up putting these on for the first cold day in Colorado. They were cute with leggings. So even if I couldn‚Äôt hike in them, I figured they would do for running around town. The plan was to go to a museum downtown, but somehow I ended up on a 4 plus hour hike in the pouring rain at 46 degrees F.These little boots were amazing! Comfortable for hiking that involved serious elevation changes. No issue with the toe box. IYKYK. I sloshed up past 11,000 feet elevation on a trail that became a small river. And then sloshed down in the same conditions. They were so comfortable. They had good grip in slick mud and on slippery rocks. My feet stayed warm and dry over creek passing.I am in shock at the price of these. They are so much better than my Moab‚Äôs. The terrain didn‚Äôt phase them. They were so much more durable than I first thought.I‚Äôm super happy with them."
"I wear a size 6.5 and bought the black pair and the  brown pair. This review is for the black pair.  First impressions were that they sent me the dark brown I even asked my husband what color they were and he said dark brown. Although the coloring is off I still feel in love with these boots.The fit couldn‚Äôt have been better. Great ankle support and cushioning with arch support on insoles. The fur was the icing on the cake.I couldn‚Äôt wait to wear them so instead of shorts I threw on jeans and the boots in Texas in 90 degree heat and took my dog for a walk.  My feet never hurt nor did they sweat. It was better than wearing my asics or vans or Nike the arch support kept me walking as if I had a pair of my tennis shoes on.A neighbor asked where I got them and I referred them hereWaterproof I can‚Äôt fully attest to as it did sprinkle but not enough to leave puddles although the tops didn‚Äôt have spots left on them from where the droplets did hit them. So that was a relief. I‚Äôm going to scotchgaurd them just to be safe.I was walking on dirt and through woods a bit but what dirt sand leaves twigs I ran into was easily brushed off and no scratches or tears.The boots were stiff for first part of walk but soon loosened to a comfortable fit still providing the additional ankle support and cushioned insole.I will be buying the pink ones next hey a women can‚Äôt have to many hiking boots! Especially ones that are functional and fashionable."
"I love the feel of them with the support for your feet. The little fuzzy adds some cuteness and I love that they are durable for winter and definitely worth the price. I wear them to work, I wear them just going out. So they‚Äôre great to wear anytime! üëç I highly recommend these if you want durability AND support. üëç"
"These are very comfortable and keep your feet very warm. I haven't used them in snow as of yet,  but so far they have been very durable. They are true to size."
"I‚Äôm not a huge boot person. BUT I do own three pairs of boots, Muk boots, Timbs, and now this pair. I got them yesterday- fast shipping- arrived right on my birthday :) The value for product is unmatched. They are comfortable and fluffy on the inside. I live in the Midwest and got these for when I shovel snow to keep my toes warm. Luckily it has not snowed yet here, but based on the reviews I read, they will be nice for the cold weather. Plus they are cute! Win win!"
"They fit like a dream, are unbelievably comfortable and the quality it top notch. I am absolutely thrilled."
"These boots far exceeded my expectations!!! They are not only beautiful, but they're super warm and comfy!!! I live in a very cold area and need water resistant, comfort, beauty, and warmth!!! Check, check,check, and check!!! Thrilled with the product!!!"
"I had high hopes for these boots, wore them for half an Ohio winter season and they couldn't stand the test of time. Now mind you I was not using them even as actual hiking snow boots, I simply wore them as cutesy boots with jeans maybe 8 or so times. While they are very attractive boots and were originally comfortable, the heel/Achilles area wore down pretty quickly and started to rub badly in that area even with decently thick socks, also the bottoms (inside the boot) would somehow get wet after about the 4th wear. Not like I was splashing around in puddles or anything, just simply walking through snow or in some minor slush areas. Not sure if I just got a poorly made set or what. But they were not all I expected them to be sadly."
"These boots are comfy, warm &ever so light on your feet.Bought them as it's getting so cold & wet lately, they keep my feet very cosy."
"Very comfy and true to size"
"I wanted some boots for dog walking. I didn't want to spend too much as they were likely to get covered in mud. I was sceptical about the price and whether they would be comfortable enough. They are perfect. We'll worth the money!"
"I've enjoyed these boots several times already and I just bought them! They're very cute and comfortable. Kind of sporty looking which is what I wanted. I bought a 6.5 to make room for my thick socks, but I think a 6 would have been a better choice. They are slightly too big... not enough to exchange because my thick socks vary enough that I can choose my thickest ones and still be comfortable.Note it states ""hiking STYLE"" boots. These are not hiking boots. Don't mistake them for hiking boots, they won't hike well. There's no grip on the sole. They do LOOK like hiking boots though, so if it's the look you want, here it is."
"First of all they have wide widths.  I am grateful for that.  I like to wear a thicker sock in the winter and my feet are a bit wider than normal folks.  It's a little work to get them on, but they are comfortable.  No breaking in period, I wore mine all day without them hurting my feet at all.  What I don't understand is why all of the colors are not the same price? I looked a week ago and the grey ones were $79 and then looked recently they were the same as the other colors at $44.  I ordered right away before the price jumped again.  I would order 1/2 size larger than your normal.  All in all cute boots, very comfortable, reasonably priced."
"ETA- they were so uncomfortable getting on and off I ended up donating them. Disappointed.Cute pair of boots, I chose the lighter color which I think goes nicely with many outfits. So far they seem like better quality than a different pair I recently bought from a discount store for the same price range. You could dress these up or down which is nice. Comfort is good, and they kept my feet pretty warm. Only thing I donâ€™t like, is that itâ€™s a bit hard getting them on/off because of the high top ankle."
"These booties are so nice. They are a great quality. Look good with jeans, or long skirts and dresses.  The material is  so nice. The price is great. I got a 8 w because I need ankle support as well as room for my toes. They give me this. I recommend these."
"I needed to get a wide width due to edema which hopefully will improve soon. But, none of my regular shoes would get over my swollen feet. These were my exact size. I am a 9 1/2  regular width so I increased the width to get shoes on and these worked like magic. And they look cute too. I did not have to go up a size like other reviewers said nor did I have to wear bulky socks. This is day one, and I hope they stay this comfortable."
"Love then, stile is cute. I think they run small though alby a bit so if yiu wear wide like a do. Might need to size up. Feel in the middle between roomy and snug, so might need to return and size up for socks, haven't tested it yet. Hard to pull off once they are tight. And are a bit small in back towards the heel"
"White mountain is a good brand for a shoe or a boot. I found the sizing to be spot on. I am an 8 1/2 wide and that is exactly what I ordered and it fit comfortably. This is a good walking boot as well as fashionable. Functional and fashionable definitely would order again."
"Cliffs always makes good quality boots. This has a non skid sole, lightweight, comfortable and is warm. Absolutely love this. Only downfall is it doesn't have zippers but this is no big deal. I'm a zipper girl lol."
"These boots are very cute but a bit hard to pull on. Always need to loosen up the laces."
"These are even nicer than the photos. The material feels nice and sturdy, as do the soles. The furry cuff can fold up for a taller shaft, which is nice. The sweater collar is soft. After wearing the boots for only a few minutes, my feet were toasty. The fit is a wee bit large; I ordered a 10 and they fit like a 10.5, very generous. It's good because that gives me room for thick socks. I haven't worn them outside yet or for an extended period of time, but they feel comfortable. I'll try to update in a couple weeks after I've worn them in a bit. Overall, I really like these! I think they'll be great.EDIT I ended up returning them. They were just a bit too big and it made me feel self-conscious, like my feet looked like clown shoes. It was disappointing because they're beautiful boots. I also realized that I really like having a side zip, and these have none."
"You wouldn't think for this affordable price that these would last this long, but I bought them for a 10 day trip to Ireland, and I put A LOT of steps on these, from mud, to puddles, to cobblestones, everything. They were also really comfortable - not too hot, but cosy. Easy to wear in all weather while we were there, and great multi-purpose boots now that I'm home."
"Really cute and warm! Was hard to put on at first because its slip on basically but once you loosen it up its good to go!"
"I received these new Terrex at 6 am today and at 8 am went to a 5 miles trail, really comfortable, water proof, looks good and fit good ,"
"Adidas are the only brand I buy online because I know I won't have any fit problems. I wear a normal Size 10 and these fit as expected. They look cool and they are comfortable. Great traction and no issues so far. I will update this review should I have any issues when I put miles on these.Update 1: This is my second pair of Adidas Terrex shoes. My other pair are Terrex Skychaser LT GTXs. These AX4 are a little bit different. The toe box is a little bit more narrow. Not a problem for me, but keep this in mind if you have wide feet. Also, the sole and heel of the AX4 is much more firm. These are not squishy when you walk or run, but the sole is very supportive."
"Love the look and feel of the shoes. I wear a 13 in all my other shoes. These definitely don’t fit the same. Had to return and order a 14. They fit perfect."
"My husband moves furniture as a job so he needs comfortable shoes, and he really likes these. The treads are wearing down pretty quickly because they are being used for intense work. They fit well and don't cause his feet to hurt. He has not complained about his back hurting nearly as much since he started wearing these."
"I bought the olive Terrex AX4 hiking shoes without Gore-Tex fabric online accidentally while not paying complete attention. I love my black Terrex AX3 shoes with Gore-Tex and I thought something in a different color would be good. The AX3’s with G-T are a little better hiking shoe than the AX4 generation. The 3’s have better rubber outer toe support/protection and are a little more supportive shoe with better tread. The tread on the 3’s is also more knobby, but it doesn’t wear down as fast and has great traction on slippery surfaces. With the Gore-Tex fabric it’s also more durable in areas the shoe breaths. The AX4 without G-T looks like it has lower quality construction on some parts to me. The tread on the bottom is good, it’s the same harder Continental rubber from the AX3 generation. The lugs on the shoe are flatter though and I think they’ll wear down quicker making some surfaces slippery.  On the AX4 they have more fabric on the toe and less rubber which I think will lead to more stubbed toes and shoe scuffing/damage. Additionally without G-T the meshy fabric on the shoe where it breaths looks cheap and I think it will snag and damage easily if you’re somewhat hard on shoes or use them in the woods. The mesh reminds me of a lower quality mesh fabric on Nike or Adidas walking/running shoes you see at department stores. In some photos online the AX4 has images of white speckles on the bottom rubber/tread area of the shoes. I think the white specks are just poor editing. When looking closely though, I did notice very little speckles of black rubber or rubber dust in the gray rubber on the shoe. If you look closely, the gray has texture on it. I think that comes from the shoe going into a mould or something that makes contact with it to make that texture pattern. I think the black is rubber dust or debris not completely cleaned out of some moulds or whatever makes contact when the gray rubber when it’s textured and formed. I can also see little glue fibers in some spots where the shoe was glued to the tread. They also must wipe the shoe down if it gets over glued or before it gets shipped away. 1 shoe had little fibers on it like a throw away cloth or paper towel had wiped 1 shoe. I’m still going to wear these shoes, but they’re not something I’d wear hiking or in the woods. I’d wear them running errands or hanging out with friends. My suggestion is if you want a great hiking shoe get the AX3 with Gortex. I imagine they’ll be discontinued at some point for the newer models coming. I wear the AX3’s for both work and everyday. They truly hold up to whatever I can put them through. I think the AX4 especially without Gore-Tex needs improvements to be considered a hiking shoe."
"I own several pairs of these shoes, in both low and high top. They are light weight, comfortable, durable, and excellent for everyday wear or outdoor activities. I wear mine for hiking, rappelling, canyoneering, caving, etc. I also wore them as duty boots for regular patrol and SAR missions. They fit true to size. The soles stick to pretty much any surface, even when wet. They will not stick to wet mossy surfaces though, but what shoe does? The ones with Gortex dry super-fast."
"On the first wear it felt tight. As I walked they loosened up and they feel great. My new fav. I personally love the style and they are a perfect all around shoe for me. I walk and these are excellent."
"he loves them, had to go1/2 size bigger for comfort but otherwise a nice seemingly sturdy shoe."
"Comfy and looks stylish"
"Love these boot. I used them on my motorcycle rides in cold weather. Nice quality product. Waterproof & keep your feet warm. Don't buy if your feet are wide. Fits snug probably D or M."
"Your review process is way to early. I haven't tried them out yet. The look is good and the fit in fine. Check back in three months or so."
"I got these boots to use outside on my farm. I needed something that could hold up to daily use and also be warm as our temperatures can get into the 20s or less. I am pleased with these boots. They are comfortable and keep my feet warm. Especially for the price you pay.They are a little on the heavy side but I think that’s just because they hold up well. Worth the buy."
"These kept my husband feet absolutely dry and he said “if I didn’t have these boots you got me I would be hating life right now!” As we walked through melting mush.I will say they DO NOT WORK WELL IN ICE. Slippery as all get out on the ice. But in the snow, which is what they are designed for, they are perfect!!!! Great boots and the price is perfect.Recommend purchasing"
"Okay, snow boots should last in SO Cal.Very comfortable. Only wore them when it rained.I think I bought them in December.I noticed this morning as I was cleaning them that the left boot has a hole wearing through the rubber. Cheap manufacturing. Very bummed. I really liked these. Zippers are a bitch. They make me late for events."
"These boots are very comfortable, my feet stays warm and dry , my only grieve is the zipper keeps going down but other then that these boots are very comfortable. Revised after wearing these boots for a month . Like I said the boots fit like a glove an the zipper comes down often but if you put your pants legs over the zipper they stay up I don’t know if this will help other out but for me the zippers stays up . I’m still wearing the boots an yes they are very water proof . My feet stays warm an dry an I recommend these boots to anyone . They are awesome an I would purchase these boots again ."
"Husband says that these boots are heavy, but they provide a lot of stability for his ankles. They kept his feet very warm, but almost too warm, because they made his feet sweat, lol). He asked me to order him a 2nd pair though, so he really likes them!"
"I bought these boots for working outside in NE Ohio. We get a good bit of lake effect snow and I needed a warm pair of boots. The 3m thinsulate keeps your feet well warm. I have worn the in 0 degrees Fahrenheit and have not had any issues.My two downsides to the boots are that the zipper will slowly work its way down as you walk and the boots are actually too warm at times. If you wear these over say 20 degrees Fahrenheit, your feet may sweat and make them colder"
"This was excellent when testing it outside. I stayed nice and warm and had no problems whatsoever."
"I (5'9"" woman with average sized head) bought two of these two years ago, and am now buying a third so that my two kids and I all have one. My 7yo and 10yo boys have heads the same size as mine (they inherited giant heads from their dad, lol), and this balaclava works great for both of them and for myself. It's not terribly thick, but if it were it wouldn't fit under a helmet well, and it's thick enough to keep us warm! We've used them 3-5 times a year for the past two years (we don't generally use them unless the temps dip down in to the teens or lower, not counting wind-chill), and I've put them through the dryer numerous times and the washer several times, and these have held up well. The face-covering portion is just right--not too tight and not too loose. For adults with huge heads, though, this probably won't be ideal--it's too small to be comfortable for my husband (he wears size 8 in baseball hats, for reference)."
"This balaclava ski mask has quickly become a must-have in my winter gear collection. Whether I’m hitting the slopes, riding my motorcycle, or just braving a cold day, this mask delivers in every way.Warm and Cozy: The material is soft and insulating, keeping my face, neck, and head warm even in freezing temperatures. It’s perfect for those chilly mornings when the wind is biting, providing full coverage without being bulky.Breathable and Comfortable: Despite its warmth, the mask is surprisingly breathable. I never feel suffocated or overheated, even during intense activities like skiing or snowboarding. The fabric wicks away moisture, keeping me dry and comfortable throughout the day.Versatile Fit: The design is flexible and fits comfortably under my helmet, making it ideal for motorcycle riding as well. It stretches to accommodate different head sizes, so both men and women can wear it without any issues.Durable and High-Quality: The stitching is strong and well-finished, ensuring this mask will last through many winters. It’s been through multiple washes and still looks and feels brand new.Multi-Purpose Use: I love how versatile this mask is. Whether I’m skiing, snowboarding, biking, or just taking a walk on a cold day, this balaclava provides the protection and warmth I need. It’s also great for layering under other gear.If you’re looking for a reliable and comfortable winter face mask, this balaclava is a fantastic choice. It’s become an essential part of my cold-weather wardrobe, and I highly recommend it for anyone who spends time outdoors in the winter."
"I had been using a wool balaclava for years; they were the ones with open eye sockets, nose and mouth orifices. They were heavy, constrictive and overall, they were not as comfortable as I wanted. I discovered this pair which not only had better visibility, breathability, multiple ways of wearing it and much more comfortable as well as keeping my face warm. Also, my hearing is not impaired which is ofter an overlooked feature but which may well prove to be an indispensable safety feature. With a good pair of goggles, I am now fully protected from harsh wind, snow and ice while outside. These are perfect for my needs and I expect you will feel the same. Oh yes, they are well made and I expect them to wear very well."
"Does the job and not scratchy"
"I’ve been using it during my morning cycling sessions, and it’s been fantastic for keeping the chill at bay. The protection it offers from the wind and the October cold, around 40°F, is impressive. It keeps my face, neck, and head warm, which makes a big difference on those brisk early rides. The material feels soft against the skin, and the snug fit provides comfort without being too tight or restricting.Wearing it under a helmet is no problem at all; it fits perfectly without adding bulk or making the helmet feel uncomfortable. One of the best features is its versatility – I can easily slip the face mask down when I just want to use it as a hat, which is really convenient for times when I need to cool down a bit. Overall, it’s an excellent choice for anyone needing reliable cold-weather protection for outdoor activities like cycling, skiing, snowboarding."
"Glasses still fog up really bad unless your glasses are over the mask and the mask is rubbing your eyeballs. Also the neck cover needs to be longer, it constantly gets pulled out of my collar with the turn of my neck. It’s warm and is comfortable if you can get past the little things. Don’t have to worry about foggy glasses if you don’t wear them lol"
"This works great and fits great also would definitely recommend very fast shipping would buy again"
"I bought this as I work outside on rooftops all day and started getting wind burn in fall / when the snow started to fly. Immediately I noticed dispute the material being thin, it kept me warm and kept the wind off my face well. Would recommend as it feels high quality and works well."
"It fits"
"Thank you"
"A must have product for very cold climate areas. The material is very soft and provides good warmth cover. Will recommend for all hikers and bikers"
"I really like this package deal because it include all important and basic supplies I need for emergency.I never thought of shove, tent, camp light and knife with variety tool I might need.The price was perfect because prime deal and quick shipping!The bag was nice size and small. I like the color and type of quality . It believe this bag would last alittle bit longer compare to plastic box.Nice quick zipper and extra pocket inside."
"All the essentials. Not too big but full of what you need."
"I knew what I was getting into, with the price I knew quality wasn’t gonna be amazing. And yes, as the reviews say, it is tiny and jam-packed with stuff. The tools are also tiny and if you want full sized tools, this ain’t it, chief. But there’s a lot of pretty decent stuff here. But some of the stuff just doesn’t work, or is just useless and probably could buy a better replacement separately if you need, probably cheap.For example, the compasses are sorta junk, the standalone one is finicky but can get an accurate read, wouldn’t rely on it and would suggest buying a separate one.Especially the “compass” in the handle of one of the tools, totally junk. Same style as the one in my power bank I bought from tiktok. Just floats around in there and doesn’t actually work at all.The folding knife I was actually pretty impressed with. It doesn’t have a good lock so it can technically fold back in during use but I haven’t had that. The blade is pretty dang sharp, sharper than my own pocket knife I carry. Enough that I gave my self a small cut trying to see its sharpness. Very lightweight but transportable because of the skeletonI won’t entertain the idea of the spoon, fishing line, or glow sticks, like I’d ever actually use them. I’m sure they’d work in a pinch but not why I bought this.Haven’t put batteries in the lamp or flashlight, but I assume they should work, if not I’ll change the review.I also didn’t take the tent, blankets, or the poncho out cause I didn’t feel like folding them back up again.The “medkit” is pretty basic. Wouldn’t use it on its own. Other than to help with the cut I got from the blade lol. But I’ll likely order some more and see if I can’t just fit it inside the bag. If not I’ll bite the bullet and buy a full medkit. Cause if this were a video game it would only restore like 5hp. There’s some bandages and I think a bit of gause, but it’s mostly i think betadine and alcohol wipes, and bandaids. I think some aspirin pills or something possibly. Aka, this would be good for school nurses. *ER* Nurse, well, not on any day.The survival bracelet is ok. Whistle works as expected but the compass again is junk and doesn’t work. The bracelet isn’t adjustable from what I can tell, and since I have skinny wrists it was pretty loose on me. I haven’t tested the fire starter inside the bracelet, or the other standalone fire starter. Was about to but came to my senses that I was inside, and I didn’t want to light my carpet on fire… So, I’ll have to bring it outside when it’s not raining. Again, I’ll update the review if either one don’t workPhone case worked and you actually can use the screen which I thought was neat. Didn’t really buy this for that at all but, seeing as it works, it might come in handy one day.I forgot about the “saber card” I think it was called. Still have no idea what the heII that is lol. I suppose the tools on it might work but I really wouldn’t likely use. Still baffles me and cracks me up that they put a mini ruler on it for whatever reason. But if you ever need to measure something 3 inches…uh…on second thought keep it to yourselfI highly doubt you’ll ever need as many q-tips out there in the wilderness as there is. Unless you’re cleaning a rifle or something, but you’d probably want a different kit for that.I’m going off of memory here so I’ll probably miss something but I wouldn’t recommend buying this pack for any one thing in particular, just for the convienience of everything all in one bag, and having it all shipped for a flat fee and you can decide what you need and don’t.Oh right, the wire saw. I probably won’t even open that but I doubt it’s that good.To be honest, the best part of this is the kid in me opening it all up, cause there’s a LOT of stuff. Pretty fun even though some of it was junk. But some stuff I hope to never need. But having survival stuff like this gives me some comfort in preparation. But I also wouldn’t recommend this being your “bug-out bag.” Or just your only survival equipment in general. But rather, because of its size it could maybe be a simple portable version you take out with you. Or like I will do, because of the strap on system, have it as bag attachment to a bigger rucksack with a more complete bag. Imma be honest though, the whole thing all in one bag is pretty beefy, I don’t know how many pounds but in my hands felt pretty heavy. That’s why I think having it on a rucksack might be better than carrying it around with you"
"Hands down one of the best purchases from Amazon. Everything is high quality, all useful items. Everything is packed well, with individual carrying cases for the majority of the items. Looking forward to using this. I recommend you get one for each person in your camp. I did."
"This was great. Me, my dad, and brother had a great time outdoors hiking a mountain nearby. This bag is small and looks like it doesn’t hold much, that’s why I was happy and surprised with all the items that came in it. They really thought of everything. Fishing supplies, small knife and axe, saws, emergency tent, emergency blanket, thorough fist aid kit, and other things. It’s pretty light even with some of the heavier items like the small axe/hammer. The knives are actually sharp too so they do their job. I definitely recommend."
"Smaller than I thought for some reason and yet very practical and useful."
"Unfortunately, I went ahead and bought this, and I truthfully don’t care if anybody believes me or not, but I am just slightly disappointed. I’m usually pretty chill about everything I buy even when some things have a few issues or flaws. I never really write reviews either but this time I thought, “what the heck.”After reading all of these reviews mentioning how small this item, much smaller then they thought, I was prepared—or so I thought. It still kind of shocks you just how small it really is lol everything is basically miniature and only a few items are of decent quality i.e. the pen and the paracord, multi-functional wrist band. That being said, it’s still a cool little bag of goodies for the right person, but to be honest, to bring everybody into the light here, the perfect candidate to gift this to is your 10-12 year old son or nephew for his annual Boy Scout camping trip. Hayden, Bryce and Aiden will absolutely love it. Take that however you may, just know I don’t mean it’s only pertinent to a 10-12 year old boy but it’s really just for some buying perspective and may help you know what you’re looking for…everybody’s opinion is different, so, I digress.So, I’ll say the quality of this set is borderline fisher•price/playskool if you ask me.. erector set to be as fair as I can. Now, as a 33 year old adult male, I was feeling quite silly taking everything out—almost reminding me as if I were an 11 year old boy performing a cringeworthy, family arranged play around a campfire at the annual up-north Kumbaya soirée with uncle chubbs, cousin Bert and the whole gang, whilst the theme of the play being an educational demonstration of the key tactics of survival. Only not good. Not good at all. (cousin Bert starts the slow clap…) Berrrrt…Bert! Shhhhhh!!!!! Not yet. Smh. Bert.My point is that if you are looking for a nice, real survival kit, and you’re over, okay, let’s say the age of 15 to be as fair as possible, this is not for you.Everything is much smaller than you will expect, even after knowing this bit of info. Again, opinions differ, so, if this is just something you want to have in case of a minor emergency, anything can really be useful in that situation, even this fanny-pack of “survival” tools.I love you all, so, jot that down."
"Not too bad but the lantern is pocket sized and made of the cheapest materials but still very bright."
"I feel like I‚Äôm always in the go. My mornings generally consist of drinking a coffee made from my keurig machine, but on those days that I have more time, I prefer drinking something a bit more customized. I don‚Äôt want a coffee maker because of how much storage and counter space it takes, and my last French press shattered in the dish washer. So this Stanley pour over made out of stainless steel is really appealing to me. Its sized perfectly for the cup, our even using it over tumblers/mugs. It‚Äôs a great product that will last years to come. And yes, it makes a good cup of coffee (without the need for filters)."
"I love every Stanley product I own. I usually use disposable pour over filters, but I wanted to try this. The quality is amazing. This is perfectly priced.  Super easy to clean! Can make a big cup of coffee or a small one. Holds a ton of water. And is super easy to use!"
"I‚Äôve never purchased a Stanley item before. I heard of them because of the target Black Friday last year where people went crazy over the tumblrs. I think carrying something so big is obnoxious and I avoided this brand for a long time because of the stigma. I was looking for a coffee maker that made a single cup and I didn‚Äôt have to use pods or electricity for some coffee at my work desk. I should have known to look for camping stuff! This is perfect for me. I‚Äôm a bit of a coffee snob and aside from the waste of plastic I was not a fan of the freeze dried coffee flavor from pods. You get great flavor from this although it only needs to brew for 4 min. I get bougie ground coffee and never had a problem with the grinds seeping through. I also always put flower petals in the top for extra flavor- and it does a great job at seeping them into the coffee but never see them in my cup. Oh- and I read the Stanley promise, I love that you can call them for replaced parts instead of purchasing the whole set which makes me feel comfortable about my purchase. I have mugs at home but I was nervous about buying the pour over separately in case it‚Äôs not compatible with any of the mugs I own. It seems like it totally would be, but the set is aesthetically pleasing. I also HATE stainless steel items because I can taste the metal. I think coffee is a strong flavor to begin with, but luckily I don‚Äôt taste metal at all with Stanley :)"
"I purchased this for a camping trip. It was easy to clean and stored well in a small space. The coffee mug has a nice lid but I wish it had a magnetic slider to close it so bugs can‚Äôt get in my mug.It takes a few minutes to trickle down from the filter into the mug, but that was expected.Overall, I give it 5 stars. Money well spent."
"Pros-it‚Äôs fun to use and the brew is tasty. Fairly easy to make a cup in a few minutes. Looks great on any counter was one of the appeals that drew me in. Good size for a limited space/storage situation with the 2 piece design. Use the built in filter or paper filter - even at home the paper filter is best solution for me.Cons-2 piece setup doesn‚Äôt attach, do don‚Äôt knock the top over! No issues so far just fyi. Again, the included metal filter works fine, but in a camper (limited water) to rinse and clean after each brew (will not let any grinds go down the RV sink) I immediately bought a large pack of cheap paper filters and they work great- zero mess but does add to the waste can. And a biggie here. I love the mug but the base is too big for for a couple of my vehicle‚Äôs so have hold onto it. I use hot just boiled water but the brew isn‚Äôt that hot when finished? Which actually I use the lowest heat setting on the Kureig anyway but this is only sort of warm??Last con-uses more coffee per brew vs. my reusable k-cup. Toting a lot of coffee for the Stanley is a consideration when packing for travel in a small space. So‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep it for the house- it‚Äôs cool and fun to use at home with a good tasting brew. (I use retail Maxwell or Folgers medium ground) it‚Äôs economical and good enough coffee for me!However, I‚Äôll buy a slim Kureig‚Äôs for the Sprinter so I can reuse my old refillable k-cup and have the handy attached water tank as well."
"The quality expected from Stanley. Makes a good cup of coffee, running water to help rinse out the strainer is helpful.  I would like an engineer genius to figure out how to make this identical item, but nested to store smaller and pack easier. Great for camping with facilities and storage spaces, but not as convenient for backpacking trips. The good cup of coffee in the morning gets it 5 stars, and I would take it backpacking, but I'm looking for something more convient to stuff in a backpack."
"As always Stanley makes high quality products, and this is no exception! Very easy to use and also very easy to clean! Brews up coffee or tea in just a min or two and very low profile so easy to pack for your trip or outing! Will buy again if this one ever gets worn out ü´∂"
"While I don‚Äôt drink coffee my wife can‚Äôt start her day without it.  This was the perfect solution for when we go rustic camping for her to get her coffee in the AM.  It‚Äôs easy enough to use just heat up some water out your grounds in the top piece, set the top piece on top of the cup and pour your water over the grounds.  The coffee drips down into the cup which she says is the perfect size cup of coffee for her in the morning. The product works great and while it want the cheapest my wife thinks it wads a great purchase."
"I recently added the Stanley The Camp Pour Over Coffee Set to my collection of coffee gadgets, and I must say, it has been an absolute game-changer for my morning routine. This pour over coffee set has truly exceeded my expectations in every aspect.The first thing that struck me was the amazing quality of this product. The stainless steel construction gives it a sturdy and durable feel, ensuring it will withstand the test of time. It's clear that Stanley has poured attention to detail into crafting a product that exudes excellence.Using it couldn't be simpler. Whether you're a coffee connoisseur or a beginner, the intuitive design makes it a breeze to create a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. The step-by-step process is straightforward, and I found myself effortlessly brewing a rich and flavorful cup every time. It's as easy as adding your coffee grounds, pouring hot water, and watching the magic unfold.One of the standout features of this coffee set is its promise of longevity. With proper care, I have no doubt that this pour over set will last forever. The quality materials used in its construction give me the confidence that I'll be enjoying my favorite brews from this set for years to come. It's an investment that's definitely worth making for any coffee enthusiast.A notable bonus is the versatility of the Stanley Camp Pour Over Coffee Set. Not only does it fit perfectly on various Stanley mugs and bottles, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it also fits seamlessly with my existing mugs and bottles. This adaptability adds an extra layer of convenience, making it an ideal companion for outdoor adventures, road trips, or simply enjoying a cozy morning at home."
"The battery pack is light weight. It does appear charging in Sun light with green light and blue lights on. Solar panel charging is slow as expected with Photovoltaic cells. It helps on camping trips and emergency situations. The flashlight is not bright, may be less than 100-150 lumens at most like a cell phone. I didn‚Äôt test the full capacity of the battery pack though. It appears robust enough, time will tell about the performance and reliability."
"I love this solar power pack. I bought it for hurricane season but soon learned so many times I use it. Great for camping, hiking, really any outdoor activity. Love the light and SOS feature. Very durable, easy to use. As expected solar charging is slower but gets the job done, especially during power outages. Clips right on to my backpack and is rain resistant."
"I bought this solar phone charger a few days before Hurricane Milton, thinking I was being super prepared for the biggest hurricane to hit the Tampa area. I knew we‚Äôd be without power for a while, and I thought this would be a lifesaver. Well, I was right about losing power, but this charger totally let me down! It barely held 2 out of 4 capacity and didn‚Äôt keep my phone charged when I needed it most. It was pretty scary being without reliable power, and this charger just wasn‚Äôt up to the task. Definitely looking forward to returning it for something more trustworthy!"
"This power bank is ideal for outdoor adventures, offering multiple full charges for devices and the ability to charge two devices at once. The solar panel provides a small boost in sunlight, best suited for emergencies rather than full recharges. Its rugged, splash-proof design includes a built-in flashlight and compass giving it even more functionality. Overall, it‚Äôs a reliable power bank for long trips but isn‚Äôt ideal if you‚Äôre relying solely on solar charging."
"I like this product a lot, but today the flashlight just randomly stopped working! It worked three days ago, and I‚Äôve used this item very minimally. I can‚Äôt get to the manufacturers website to get support. Huge bummer. Of course I did all the appropriate troubleshooting, and the battery appears to be charged fully. However, the light is not turning on at all. You might consider looking elsewhere for a better product."
"This portable at least 2x lighter than my old portable but performs the same if not better. Takes a few hours to charge but once it charges fully, it lasts me around 4-5 charges on iphone 12 pro max. Great product can't complain."
"What that means is. Husband goes to training quite frequently. He is always needing battery packs for it. They are always super annoying to keep charged and make sure they are good to go. This pack was a life saver for his past training he used it for over a week and worked the entire time!"
"Whenever I stop being grumpy, I'll purchase another one of these because it's really a great little charger. I bought this for a camping trip and used it maybe three times to charge my phone. LOVED IT. It fast charges my phone and it's solar powered, the flashlight was cool but the compass didn't work at all.So also.. my husband hung it up on a small d-ring we had on our boat and we forgot it there, just taking in beams of light as we drove across the lake. We hit maybe two waves and the only thing left was the cute little clip it came with.. so clearly the plastic on the actual device was less strong than the clip itself. Not saying that there's a manufacture issue for that specific of an issue because I doubt they account for being shaken violently while being tethered to a speeding boat, but hey.. there's always room for improvements haha you just never know. Maybe next time I come back to purchase it'll be renamed ""boat ready, can be shaken in 40mph winds"""
"Review: SZHLUX Camping Hammock DoubleThe SZHLUX Camping Hammock Double is spacious, durable, and perfect for outdoor relaxation. Made from sturdy, breathable nylon, it comfortably holds two people without sagging. Setup is quick with the included tree straps, and it packs down compactly for easy carrying. Whether for camping or backyard lounging, itâ€™s an excellent, affordable choice for couples or solo use."
"I really liked this portable camping hammock! Itâ€™s lightweight and easy to pack, making it perfect for outdoor trips. Setting it up was a breeze, and it felt sturdy once hung between trees. The material is comfortable and breathable, so I stayed cool even in warmer weather.Itâ€™s also spacious enough to relax in comfortably, but compact enough to carry around without taking up too much room in my gear. The only thing I would improve is the strapsâ€”they could be a bit longer for more versatility. Overall, itâ€™s a fantastic hammock for camping!"
"I needed a light, durable hammock to add to my camping gear. This was one of the least-expensive options and it outperformed most of the competition.It was easy to setup, easy to teardown and as comfortable as any of the more expensive models."
"I obvs haven't tried this with two people because itâ€™s designed for one. Its very sturdy, super easy to set up (even without instructions) and perfect for camping, festivals and relaxing by the waterfall! You can easily compact and store it, and super easy to use!"
"Ive wanted a hamock for years but i always thought theyd be expensive so i never looked into getting on. That being said mothers day i decided id get myself a gift and happened to find this one the price was very cheap, once i got it and set it up i would have gladly paid twice as much its super sturdy and holds 2 people quite well the material is soft and light weight its easy to clean and cart around camping or hiking the straps are durable and the color was exactly as in the photos very happy with this product ðŸ˜€"
"This hammock was the perfect size for my husband. It was easy to set up and the color is bright. Being lightweight it would be easy to carry wherever youâ€™re going, itâ€™s a breeze to set up and you can be relaxing in comfort quick and easy."
"I'd always wanted to buy a hammock but never did because of the high price of the ones I saw. To be honest I wasn't expecting too much of this item because it was so cheap. But, I was pleasantly surprised. It's an excellent hammock. Very sturdy and well made and extremely comfortable."
"Love it, easy to set up and very comfortable. Folds up in its own neat, small bag. I Keep it in the RV and use it when camping. I should have bought 2 of them."
"Perfect for any yard or camping trip also hand for kids in bunk bed they love it or under the table in the fort cause the straps are long so versatile"
"I'm really impressed with this hammock for the price! It packs away small, light enough for camping and beach trips. You can set it up by yourself in only a few minutes, the straps are sturdy and don't slip, and they are also bark safe which is important. It's not the most comfortable hammock, the design means you are basically swallowed in as soon as your weight is in there. It can be better sitting sideways and changing the weight distribution than laying lengthways. You almost need a support bar or something to hold it open like a more traditional style hammock."
"I'm really pleased with this 2-pack of headlamps. They are surprisingly bright and provide excellent visibility in the dark. Whether I'm hiking, camping, or working around the house at night, these headlamps illuminate the area well. The light is clear and adjustable, allowing me to focus it exactly where I need it. They are also comfortable to wear; the headbands are adjustable and don't feel too tight or uncomfortable after extended use. The design is straightforward and easy to operate, with simple buttons for switching between light modes. I appreciate that they come in a pack of two, which is convenient for keeping one as a spare or sharing with a friend or family member. The battery life is decent, lasting several hours on a single set of batteries. Overall, these headlamps exceed my expectations for their brightness and comfort, making them a great value for anyone needing reliable hands-free lighting."
"This light is a lifesaver at night time. The light is bright and super functional with all its options. The battery lasts a long time before needing to be charged."
"The white light is great. Comfortable to wear and plenty bright, seems easy enough to use. Didn't push it on battery life yet, but seems worthwhile.I was excited for the red light while camping, though, and that turned out to be a disappointment. A friend had a headlamp with a red beam that clearly illuminated a patch three meters out, which is plenty to see the ground while walking from tents to bathroom. This one either lost focus or just wasn't bright enough even 2 meters out, so really couldn't use it for walking around in the dark at all. This was the same for both lights, which was disappointing. Wish they'd chosen a brighter LED."
"works well get 2 for the price of 1"
"Not the brightest, but good enough for around camp or to throw in your pack in case you need it."
"The light doesn't tilt/adjust.Lightweight. Elastic adjusts well."
"I got these for my kids & I to go on night hikes outdoors. They work great! We usually hike btwn 1-3 hours & these remain bright for the entire time. I’m glad I purchased them!"
"Purchased these for gifts for the hunters in our family. These are powerful, bright, easy to adjust and operate! It’s a valued “Safety” gift for a hunter walking through the woods at dusk or night."
"Cheap feeling but it does what it is supposed to. So, 5 stars in my opinion."
"Doesn't flex/rotate head but ok as backups/spares"
"2 pcs in one bulk pack without battries"
"I wanted my middle school students to get a feel for what it was like to start a fire without modern tools, and this was a great tool for them to use. The success rate was about 20-30% (it was a moist day), but all the groups had a lot of fun, have a tactile memory of the effort required, and practiced team work in doing this. I will order again for next year."
"This item COMES ASSEMBLED!  I found the You Tube video reference really helpful.  It is exactly as advertised.  I am thoroughly satisfied.  What super fun!"
"This is a bow and drill for starting a fire, so of course it is going to suck. I find these sorts of kids incredibly difficult for getting an amber, but I needed this to practice for a competition that had a fire-starting component"
"Learning to make fire need patience but worth it"
"I understand the concept, I bought this for my son to learn and mess with different methods of fire making. This! Kit is guud‚Äù but lacks clear instruction if you didn‚Äôt already understand the concept of the bow drill I can see it being hard to mess with"
"After a little trial and error my son and I got in a rhythm and started a fire! It was really cool!"
"I got a couple of these to introduce my young sons (ages 5 and 7) to the concept of friction fire.  I really like that the bow is attached to the spindle, so it removes the frustration of having the spindle fly away from the bow like a regular bow drill.  I think this is a great teaching tool for those unfamiliar with friction fire as it eases the learning process, especially for younger users.  We got to practice our form, and learn the concept, which was the goal.  While they weren't able to get an ember during their first attempts they did learn some things, and most importantly, they didn't get frustrated and had FUN!  We will continue to refine our techniques with this kit until they are able to get an ember and start a fire, and then we will progress to a regular field crafted kit.  Overall, I think this is great way to teach newcomers, and it is also a great way to share and spend time with your kids."
"I ordered this to see how good of a product it was. This was sent in a very timely manner and arrived very quickly, with great packaging. It was very easy to use with the spindle on top of the handle which eliminates the need for a rock or harder piece of wood on top. The paracord around it makes it easier to spin fast, which inturn uses less energy to make an ember. It takes less than a few minutes to get the fire started even for a novice or beginner. It‚Äôs designed in a way, and easy enough for a child to use properly. Will be purchasing again, and would recommended to anyone."
"I picked up this survival shovel mainly to keep in my truck for emergencies, but it’s already proving to be useful around the house for small projects. The compact design makes it easy to store, and the blade is tough enough to handle digging through dirt, mud, and even snow.The pick feature is a nice touch when I need to break through tougher ground. It folds down easily and comes with a handy carrying case, making it perfect for camping or off-road trips.Some people said it's too heavy for a backpack, but I'd disagree.Pros:- Compact and easy to store under my back seat- Sturdy steel construction- Includes a pick for tougher tasks / breaking up soil- Comes with a carrying case that seems robustCons:- A bit small for larger projects"
"This is a great emergency shovel to have in both your bug out bag 🎒 and the trunk of your car 🚗. This shovel also has a few other hidden tools inside the handles that can come in handy 😉 and it comes apart at the handles for compact storage. Seems to be just the right size to handle anything from mud and dirt to snow as well as cutting and sawing. This is a great survival multi tool. Thanks Rhino USA. I love it.  Tony H."
"I originally purchased this for a snowmobile trip but this little shovel has proved itself useful many times over the past year. It packs compact and is light enough to throw in a backpack. This is one of those items that you will use more than you realize. Would recommend this to others."
"It's fine as a light use camp shovel. It folds and unfolds okay. I haven't used it for anything other than digging up difficult to remove tent stakes or covering and separating campfire coals and light digging at campsite. I agree with the customers who are disappointed that it's not made in the USA and think the advertising is deceiving, but I already knew that before I bought it because I actually read the reviews beforehand. It would probably cost at least twice the Amazon price to be made in the USA these inflated days so I understand why it's not. I purchased it in hopes that it would last for my intended use and because the company appears to care enough to donate to reputable charities. I'm not sure how much of the purchase goes to charity, but that's okay since I was purchasing a product, not donating to the charities. So far I'm satisfied with the quality of the product and will update if that changes."
"Wow! Really nice well versed camping/survival tool. Sharp edges, sturdy extension pcs. The cool hidden gadgets is an extra OO7 feature haha. Definitely worth the price. This for sure is everything and more than I expected."
"I bought this because I needed a small shovel to scoop dog poo but I feel a lil bad cause this is a nice hand shovel. Good materials, easy to figure out, comes with a warranty and a bag (which I won’t use for a poo shovel but I’m keeping it anyway cause it’s a nice nylon storage bag).Whoever said in reviews that the advert was deceptive re: made in the USA, I beg to differ. Unless something says those words, assume it’s not. This company was extremely blunt and considering it doesn’t cost $50, wherever /whoever made it did a fine job.I think I’ll get the fancier multitool one for my outdoorsy brother. He’d love it and he’s a snob for quality. 10/10 would shovel poo with again"
"I’m digging in my basement crawl space in a confined area. It’s rugged, yet light. I got the straight handle so I can jab into clay soil and roots then pry up with it. I’m amazed how strong it is. Love the cover so I can throw it in the back of my seat in my truck. Must be made of some type of aircraft aluminum, I don’t know, but the blade is thick. Better than the one I humped all over the deserts. Be a great gift for a son, or daughter…"
"This small but heavy duty, what we used to call, an Army Shovel, came in very handy and much needed to dig the ground underneath my mobile home. I was getting sewer stoppages for a long time and the quotes to fix my sewer pipe under there was astronomical. With my new, handi-dandi army shovel, I was able to dig it up, under there, and do the repair myself, for a FRACTION of the price. No other shovel I had could do the job. Even cutting the handle down short couldn’t get it. With the army shovel you can change the angle of the shovel in close quarters. And it has a small pick (ground-scratcher) as well, making it easier to break up the hard ground for easier dirt removal.I highly recommend this JEWEL for jobs such as mine, and would also be very handy to have available on camping trips and such. And the price is reasonable!"
"Bought this to carry in an emergency bag I keep in my truck. Folds into a compact size but when assembled seems to be a well built sturdy shovel."
"Perfect fit in  small bag but can go up 3 feet sturdy and light"
"I got this for my husband as a stocking stuff since he’s always going hunting or adventure seeking. It’s compact and can fit in any backpack or vehicle. It has so many great items and enough space to add a few more things if you want more variety. It’s definitely a must buy if you go off roading or hiking often."
"Wow, this has everything.  I love it. I'm keeping it in my car for emergencies."
"Got it for my son for Christmas on sale for $25! It’s very cool I think he will love it!"
"Jam packed full of the essentials. Thought it would be bigger but it gets the job done"
"All the supplies shown where in the bag ! Definitely good for traveling"
"This kit is exactly as portrayed by the Amazon listing.  In fact, I used the listing to aid me in identifying some of the items.As I live in Colorado, I primarily bought this to keep in the SUV, just in case.  When travelling in the mountains, it is surprisingly easy for a routine drive to become a survival situation.  This kit will help out immensely in that situation."
"This item was purchased as a GIFT, and the recipient absolutely LOVED it!!! Thanx for this opportunity!!!"
"The running vest is an excellent choice for any avid runner. It offers a fantastic fit that conforms comfortably to your body, minimizing any bounce or chafing during your runs. The storage options are impressive, with multiple pockets and compartments that securely hold essentials like your phone, energy gels, and keys, without adding bulk. Additionally, the vest is remarkably lightweight, making it easy to wear without feeling cumbersome. Overall, it’s a top-notch piece of gear that combines functionality with comfort."
"I'm 66 years old and had Neck Microfracture surgery so some chest or fanny pack bags cause me neck pain.This bag is comfortable and allows me to carry more gear. It's also ""lefty"" friendly.I have tried different firearms in it and they all fit great. I even tried a Government model 1911(5 inch barrel) that's pretty darn heavy. The 1911 is more comfortable in this chest pack than it is carrying it on my hip.This pack seems well made and a good value for the price. I'm seriously considering buying another to have for a spare."
"I bought this to start running and I love it. It’s great quality, looks fantastic, super stable when running. The elastic back straps keep it close to chest so it’s not bouncing a whole lot. It fits great out of the package but it’s also adjustable. Overall worth the money spent."
"Got this for a gift and he likes it ! The size is good! The stretch is good and very handy … the storage room on it is great!"
"It’s very cozy it’s something small so it won’t take up room it’s light weight and has many adjustments so you can fit it to your body type and looks cool while using and can fit with many outfits overall happy with my purchase"
"I like this product and would highly recommend it to those who hike, run, and/or use a CCW.The backing to the front is comfortable and has a soft comfortable backing to it. It’s mesh and has some lining on the side that I thought would irritate but it’s not an issue. This makes it user friendly when doing different activities.The zippers are good. There’s a waterproof pouch that you can store things that would otherwise function if not submerged or covered in water.The bigger pocket allows a strap and for a CCW. There’s even a convenient strap for quick draw.The front again has some capacity for other pieces of furniture that you want like a clip on mag light or something. The flag patch is removable.The back has a mesh pocket that’s see through. And the straps and buckles are pretty good as far as fit and appearance. It’s hardly noticeable wearing this thing. The value for the money is great and again I highly recommend this product. Can’t wait to see what they might update on it or other colors."
"Positives: This chest pack holds my wallet, phone, keys and all my other EDC items along with a full sized carry pistol. Its pockets and slots hold everything securely, and with little to no movement inside. The hardware works as intended and with no issues with the zippers or the side clips.Negatives: I use this chest pack for running and walking outdoors, and with only a few months of moderate use, the right side,  shoulder strap is starting to tear at the seam between the elastic material and nylon strap, with the stitching coming undone also, as shown in the picture with Red arrows.The clasps for the shoulder strap loosen and need readjustment every so often, also I have the shoulder straps tightened as far I could possibly could, and still can’t manage get the shoulder straps at the right adjustment so the chest pack isn’t sagging nor loose and flopping around while running, although I’m not sure if that’s a personable problem or product flaw yet."
"It is easy to adjust the straps to fit over what it needs to. Fits over my jacket, but I don't tighten it too much when I do. Holds quite a bit of stuff, without to holster being used. I think it is comfortable, and the fabric is soft."
"Awesome compact design that allows for a quick split on some kindling.  I've owned and used this for the past year and so far the blade has held strong and sharp. The edge seems to hold, but I am also only chopping small soft wood like pines. The small size allows for a quick swing. For the price and brand name this is hard to beat great value and addition to my camping bag"
"I purchased one of these used for around $25. Came with a few dings on the handle but hey it’s a tool doesn’t bother me. Great addition to my bug out bag, thin, lightweight, compact and definitely sharp. Even for the normal sale price I’d call it a good value."
"This is good got backpacking and lightweight"
"I’m making a get home bag to leave in the car. Since stuff might get stolen, I’m not leaving real good expensive stuff in the bag. I have better hatchets. Much better. This guy will suffice for any short term emergency and eliminates the need for any good knife in the bag. This hatchet and a mora will do the trick.This is a relatively thin stamped steel. Full tang, adequate grip. Baton small branches and twigs for tinder.Good sheath with belt loops. Not too heavy for a backpack. Good choice for a limited purpose.Also good for a new scout."
"Right size, Comfortable, Very sturdy. I like Gerber stuff."
"Light, sturdy and sharp. Great for your pack so you can break down wood for kindling and such."
"This is a remarkable hatchet. Gerber always delivers. Would highly recommend for camping or your bug out bag."
"Gray productos Greate quality 100%"
"Great product for my newest hobby where I needed a handy sized and lighter axe for my woodworking projects and the nice little safety cover is great for taking it in my backpack when I am out in the woods"
"I bought it for my husband. He likes to use them during cold weather. It is not too hot and warm with a perfect temperature. Rechargeable batteries is much convenient. The size is perfect to carry anywhere."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I‚Äôve gone through  a lot of different gloves, mitts, and combinations over the years and still needed to use those disposable hand warmers which weren‚Äôt that warm. These will eliminate the need for those!I like that they have 3 settings, the battery life has been great so far (I used them on medium heat on two hunts for a total of 5 hrs and still had some charge left) I like that they snap together so it will be harder to misplace (as I tend to do). They are compact enough to fit in my mittens. But work best in a pocket where you can curl your hand around them as the heat is only on one side unless you snap together for 360 degree heat.What I like a little less is the thickness of them (but I supposed it‚Äôs what is needs to be to maintain the charge for so long)I also wish they were pliable- they are hard plastic and the heated side is curved to fit in your palm so it may become a pain to use in ski gloves while using poles. I like to keep a warmer in my glommit top over my fingers so I as not to impede my grip on my firearm or access the trigger.But overall I like the reliable heat these provide and the money I will save on the disposable warmers.Great value!"
"These work great on a cold day.  I keep them in my pocket and turn them when I get cold."
".  It's nice that if your hands are freezing, you can use a higher setting, and once they've warmed up, the setting can be lowered.  Anything but the lowest setting gets too hot, but they lasted a good while and provided comfort."
"A great item to have in my pockets when I‚Äôm fishing in the winter time, very easy to use and long lasting"
"I cannot handle the cold and this has saved my ‚Äúalways freezing‚Äù hands. I can keep them in my jacket pockets and I can get through the winters a little easier knowing they are warm and reliable."
"I ordered these ( 2 pair ) Wednesday mid morning and received them Thursday mid morning. Charged them up and used them for the first time last night at My Oldest Grandson's High School  Rugby  Match here in Nc. It was 38 ¬∞ with a feel like temp of 33¬∞ . These hot little suckers worked GREAT ‚ÄºÔ∏è I Let my Youngest son and youngest grandson use a pair and they loved them as well. No more disposable hand warmers for this family  .They heat up FAST, fit perfectly in my hands and are also cool looking as well.. I've just used them the one time and for the price,  I can say I'm ECSTATIC about this product so far...we have 4 grandchildren that play Football, Baseball, Rugby and soccer,  so will use them often. I'll also use them when I'm out fishing on cold days.. Go ahead and buy a pair or two, you WON'T  be disappointed ‚ÄºÔ∏èüôÇ"
"I'm a ski instructor and my hands get extremely cold. I was flying through the one use hand warmers. I also didn't like how much waste I was creating with the one use ones. These warmers are absolutely amazing! They get very hot. I only ever had them turned on to the lowest setting. They last a long time and are super easy to charge. As soon as you hit that on button, you can start feeling them warm up. Love how hot they get and how fast they warm up. I absolutely recommend!"
"This unit does not have a solar panel like the lawn lights that get cloudy and quit working after awhile. Thus is a high quality.material. By virtue of the enclosed battery the unit has some good heft to it.Cordless charging is fast. It can be charged prior to camping or an approaching storm just like you would any device. It comes with a USB-C charging cord. When the power is out or you are camping the solar charger works great. High quality unit at this price."
"I went with the larger capacity as I use it for backpacking. It fully charges my phone several times on a 3-4 day trip. The flashlight is also very bright and works well. Solar capability is not any better than any other charging system, but it still works well enough. I'm not really a fan of the built in cables, but I just pack my own and plug it into the side. Easy enough"
"Purchased two power banks for use while touring Europe this fall, and we were very impressed with the performance of the power banks.  What was surprising about this product was how well it stood up every day in keeping our phones fully charged, we never ran out of power.  We were using our phones constantly throughout the day and night while touring, geocaching and taking thousands of photos.  The power bank comes with the 4 built-in cables, but we never used them, instead we opted for 3- and 6-foot fast charging Type C cords that ran from our backpacks to our phones while moving.  We also liked the wireless charger, which had no problem charging our S24 Ultras with Armor Box covers.  The only drawbacks if any, the power bank is very heavy and a bit bulky and does exceed the approved TSA battery capacity limit, but we had no problem going through TSA security checks."
"It still works great! Like most solar chargers though it takes a few hours to fully charge when using direct sunlight. I brought mine on my trip to Turkey for a week. I used it to charge my phone the entire week I was there. I believe in the description it says it can charge a phone up to 8 times, but mine only charged it about three times all the way, which worked for me perfectly. I plugged it in to recharge the solar charger every night though. It‚Äôs slightly heavy lol but I‚Äôm ok with it. I LOVE all the adapters and stuff it has. It‚Äôs so easy to use. It has a nice feel to it as well. It‚Äôs also pretty tough. I‚Äôve dropped it a couple times and it‚Äôs withstood the potential damage. The size is as described."
"I like that once it‚Äôs charged , it lasts long charging your phone. However for solar charging, it takes time to charge the pack."
"This is great. It charges quickly when plugged in, less quickly by solar panel. It's a good size to take camping, hiking, or rafting/boating, and not too heavy. It charges up my cell phone or kindle pretty quickly.I think it's best to start a trip fully charged and just top up by solar power, as it gets quite hot if you leave it in the sun long enough to charge it fully using solar power.The clip on the side is not so useful to hook it to a pack while hiking, and is plastic. One on the top and the bottom to secure it and it's orientation to the sun would be much better and more secure. Just dangling from one hook doesn't work."
"I recommend this product to everyone. Great use in an emergency and everyday use. Great product for the price. It‚Äôs holds a charge and doesn‚Äôt and takes about an hour to charge. Can charge multiple devices at once. Has multiple charging ports and adapters."
"Not as good as expected"
"Heavy, Not good quality cading, Works ok ok, Solar charging is useless."
"I purchased these lighters after getting fed up with using multiple windproof matches just to light a portable cooking stove. Instead, I invested in these two lighters to take the place of matches and free up some space in my pack. Since it came with two, I was able to put one in a survival kit in my truck and the other in my hunting equipment.The electrical lighter has a distinctive ""cool"" factor going for it with the pink crisscross lightning bolts that it has for the ignition mechanism. It's nice that it can be recharged as well. The butane lighter is pretty standard.Both of these are weather resistant and work great!"
"Wow, these are terrific. I smoke cigars, and we do adventure motorcycling - so I bought these as compact lighters that are water resistant. I haven't tested the water resistance, but I think for the price, you have to cut some slack - although I'll say, they appear VERY solid and will resist water nicely. Everything about the construction and quality is really good-  AND, I was very pleased the USB lighter works great for cigars. The 'window' where the electric current runs is quite small (seems designed for a cigarette) but I've had no issues at all lighting up my stogies, really great design. The butane came empty, but local cigar shop sold me a canister and super easy to fill!  The butane flame is powerful and just really really pleased with both of these, I'll carry both and butane will be backup if USB runs out of power/fails."
"Great little arc lighter, but I wish that the cap could either come off or folded further back. It’s nearly impossible to light a candle with it because the lid is open at a 45° angle so the arc can’t reach the wick."
"Bought these for kayaking and camping, easier to use since they are windproof. Better than matches."
"I like how they feel in my hand, smooth and light. They have a locking mechanism to keep top on. I tried the electric (arching light), and it started a fire on paper and burned it.  Good to have on hand.  I haven’t tried the fuel one yet because I need to buy fuel to fill it up. So, I’m sure it will work just as well!"
"I really like the USB arc lighter, it's pretty reliable and it will certainly start fire if you need it to. The butane lighter only ignites when the celestial conditions are just right. In other words, you might get it to light on the first click, or the 50th. Not exactly what you want if you've crashed your car in the country in the middle of winter and you're trying to start a fire to stay warm."
"I have used these for back country camping on 2 trips so far and they work great. I'm ordering a second set for my GO-bag."
"These lighters are pretty cool.  The arc lighter is interesting.  I have never used one before, but it started out fire with ease.  I have not tested whether they are water proof yet, but the case design is solid.  I like the lanyards that come with both lighters. I lose stuff a lot, so it is nice to be able to hang them around my neck while setting up camp.  Great value and works well."
"No more wind blowing out"
"Product works good. Easy to use. I use it to light my cigarettes while riding my motorcycle."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Super lightweight, I love how fuzzy and warm it is. The black color pairs great with so many different things. Easy to pack and fold up to bring with you. Quality is great, I got this my first year learning to snowboard and took some mean falls and it still held up perfectly lol. It‚Äôs functional, fits multiple helmets. Super easy to wash and it doesn‚Äôt tear to pieces after washing. Will definitely be getting different colors!"
"I was surprised how attractive this hat is.  It is really pretty and extremely soft. It is warm and can be adjusted. I purchased the leopard one and love it."
"This fleece hat is so soft and warm.  I use it when I walk my dog in the cooler weather early in the morning.  I can layer with a beanie underneath and my head and neck are so toasty!  I will enjoy wearing this with a ski helmet when I go skiing this winter too!"
"4/5 because it is kind of thinner and looks like a cheaper material, but I mean... you can tell that from the pictures. It looks exactly like the pictures (which imo isn't really the cutest, but functionality > fashion in the winter)Bought it for a chilly camping trip (~35¬∞F) and was not disappointed. Design is perfect - blocked the wind, easily adjustable to be loose or tight, easy to drink/eat while wearing without having to stretch out the mouth cover. Soft, comfortable, cozy.I've now worn on 4 camping trips, machine washed and dried each time, and it still looks like the day I got it. Definitely recommend."
"Soft snuggly and warm. Kept me warm during a trip to Iceland in November."
"I am snowboarder, I need a balaclava over the helmet, not inside the helmet, because I don‚Äôt like the balaclava too tight on my face and over my hair. This balaclava is exactly what I needed. My helmet is slightly bigger than normal adult, my helmet size is 65, if you are familiar the helmet size, normal adult would be 63. This balaclava fit over my helmet, and not very tight, I can still turn around my head to either direction easily, also the ropes in front can also help adjust the tightness of the balaclava. I really like it."
"Wasn't impressed at all with this purchase.  Seemed cheap, but boy, I was wrong!  It is amazing!!  Kept me warm when the windchill was 16.  I am ordering more to give as gifts!! Great purchase!"
"I bought this to wear while alpine skiing. It is a lot thinner and less plush than what the picture shows. It did fit well over my super warm hat, and kept my hat from flying off in the wind. I stayed warm, but again, had my awesome warm hat, so I‚Äôm not sure how it will be when I just have my ski helmet. I‚Äôll update when I find out."
"I've had this for 2 years now and it's amazing. Keeps me super warm and it's extremely comfortable."
"I was not sure about ordering a female Balaclava as I thought i might look like a bank robber lol but I did and I and so pleased with it, it is thin material but so very warm and fits perfectly. It keeps my hair dry and the cold of my neck and ears definitely very functional  but stylish."
"I purchased this one and another one that was thinner for an Iceland trip. This one definitely did the work. It was perfect fit, comfortable and kept me warm during the entire time being out in the cold. The other one was too thin."
"Very warm... versatile....I used it several was... Like it alot"
"Does what it's meant to doIf this was windproof it would be amazing."
"Love the product, keeps me very warm. I use mine for snowboarding and sometimes it gets a little too hot in there and I can‚Äôt breathe. Would be nice if had a nose port but you can always just lower the mask. Also it‚Äôs a hair short in length it seems, sometimes i‚Äôll get a breeze on my neck but overall i‚Äôd recommend."
"This is nice and soft, cozy, doesn‚Äôt smell weird - it‚Äôs perfect. I really like the double drawstrings. One controls the tightness around your forehead and the other controls around the top of your nose and back of your head. It‚Äôs fully customizable to fit your head/face shape, so you can‚Äôt go wrong with this if you have a small to medium sized head. Someone with a particularly large head may not be comfortable in this due to the depth of the hood, but I think it would work well for most people."
"I bought this to work in the cooler & it sure kept my head & nose warm."
"So far, the quality seems very good. Nice, heavy weight fleece, with a few options on wearing it.  Fits my head perfectly..I wear 7 1/4 hats, and have close cropped hair. If you have a big head..or a lot of hair, I.can see this fitting you a little tight."
"I bought this product because of this claim‚ÄúFreezing moisture is the biggest cause of discomfort when skiing or out in the cold. That‚Äôs why the Tundra Balaclava has a breathable Poly-Spandex mouth panel and moisture wicking fleece to keep you both warm and dry all day‚ÄùI wore this product on a 6 mile walk today in 32¬∞F weather.  The ‚ÄòPoly-Spandex panel is just the same fleece the rest of the balaclava is made of.  There is nothing breathable about it.  By the end of my walk the entire mouth/nose panel was drenched.  I can only imagine how bad it will be when it‚Äôs -20¬∞F out.That said, the balaclava is soft and comfortable.The sales pitch is just overhyped."
"Good quality. Made of mostly fleece. Works well for most cold temps. I used it all the way down to -55c & it kept me warm enough! I like that it's longer, so it covers all of my neck & tucks into my sweater nicely to prevent skin exposure."
"2 cups arrived broken and buyer replaced them asap! Besides that, they are great!"
"I love the size of these glasses, they aren’t huge…so if you’re looking for a BIG glass for chugging water, this isn’t it. But if you want something reasonably-sized that doesn’t take up a ton of space in your cupboard, get these. They have a nice weight, wash up well in the dishwasher with no cloudiness, with a sleek and timeless design. I upgraded my glassware and am glad I went with this option. Perfect packaging was a plus."
"Thank you, these were great and affordable."
"These glasses are very nice; simple and comfortable to hold. Nothing fancy, they have a solid bottom, seem sturdy and hold up to a dishwasher well. Great for everyday use."
"In love with these glasses! Fits in cabinets really well. It’s clear glass in color no turbidity. As far as appearance looks really good you can tell they’re quality glasses. I put these in my dishwasher and none has chipped or broken so the performance has held up pretty well"
"I do not usually do product reviews, but felt compelled on this product. These glasses are extremely brittle. Day one I was getting ice out of the fridge ice machine. The ice falling into the glass was enough to break one. They broke in the top rack of the dishwasher. Our last pair of glasses survived 7 years and only broke if accidently dropped. Half of these broke within 2 months with just everyday use. We had to purchase another generic set from Walmart."
"I had been searching for drinking glasses that were pretty, strong, were a pleasure to drink from and narrow enough to fit in my dishwasher (between the tines.) I tried several brands, but was never satisfied. This set fit the bill!"
"I had a set from Target I bought in 2015, which were made by Libbey Glass as well. I recently broke two glasses and bought these to be replacements. They are exactly like the set I got from Target years ago. Excellent, sleek, chic glasses perfect for everyday use or for elegant barware. A+"
"It’s wonderful to have matching glasses in our cupboards. I bought two sets of these."
"They look great in my place with the MidCentury decor, they fit right in. Thicker and higher-quality glass than I expected, at this price, to be honest."
"These glasses are very thick and good quality. Very cute for a farmhouse or boho chic look. Glasses are true to size. Arrived perfectly."
"Beautiful glasses, sturdy, and exceptionally priced. Customer service was also great, quick to respond, and very accommodating. One glass arrived with a small chip in it and they were quick to offer multiple reasonable solutions that I was very pleased with."
"I wanted glasses that echo the hobnail glass that was popular in the 1950s-60s. These do that, plus they are much more substantial than I’d expected. I love how the texture makes them so easy to hold, too. Wish they were available in a teal or lt blue color!"
"I love the delicate hobnail design which also gives a nonslip feel in your hand along the slightly weighted feel. I also like the 2 sizes in this set, 10 & 12 oz.  I ordered the clear ones but the colors were very attractive, too."
"LOVE these glasses so much. They are so chic and so sturdy."
"WOW . That’s about the best word I can give !!! The glasses are gorgeous love the hobnail and weight.  They came in a great box with lots of padding.  The sizes are perfect for breakfast juice and dinner drinks.  They are a great value for the moneyTHEY ARE JUST THE BEST!!!!"
"I love the look of these glasses! The glasses are made from thick, tempered glass that feels sturdy and durable. The classic design is simple yet elegant, making them suitable for a variety of occasions, from casual everyday use to more formal events. Also, very economical!"
"Very thick and durable but not too heavy. They look great and are dishwasher safe. Came with great packaging and none broke upon arrival which is great. Perfect for a fancy drink or a plain soda. They hold cold very well. Can‚Äôt complain these are great."
"The glasses are really lovely.  Feel substantial in your hand but not too heavy for my elderly relatives to use.  The shape is a nice change from traditional glasses and looks elegant.  One of the small glasses was broken during shipping (which was surprising because they were well-packaged) but the seller was very responsive and quickly made it right.  I have no complaints and wouldn't hesitate to buy these glasses again."
"This is a lovely set of cups, Perfect size for a Family, includes 4 large cups and 4 smalls cups, I would buy it again!"
"These glasses are sleek and work well. One cup came broke but it was replaced right away. Very happy with them and customer service."
"The drinking glasses arrived as described, functional for different beverages, good sizes, good grips and easy to clean."
"This set was packaged incredibly well. It‚Äôs made of a light weight yet thick glass. This set is incredibly visually appealing and I‚Äôm very pleased with the purchase. I inspected each glass and all were flawless, free of any bubbles or chips. Will definitely order another set."
"They are well packaged and came in perfect condition. The glasses are bottom heavy so they don‚Äôt tip easy (just be careful how you put them in the dishwasher). The glasses are large and hold a lot of liquid. I like the shape and feel of them. They seem to be good quality and have a perfect thickness to make them last but aren‚Äôt too thick that they are cumbersome. I have had them 2 months now and all still good. My ONLY complaint is that I want to order more, but only the smaller glasses as we use these much more than the tall ones, but I can‚Äôt find them separately, so would have to order both which I don‚Äôt want. Otherwise, great buy for the price and would recommend."
"I like the fact tgt i got short and long drinking glasses that are very nice and quality is very good"
"Perfect Glasses!  A classic look and durable.  Plus,  great that comes in 4 count and I didn’t have to purchase 8 in an order. Recommended!!"
"Love these glasses. They are good quality and thick glass, wash well and came extremely well packaged. They are a little heavy but I quite like that as it doesn't feel like they'll break easily"
"Perfect for making Old Fashions and everyday use."
"Generally like these everyday glasses and have ordered these before. Unfortunately they were either not packed well or handled badly. One of the smaller glasses was broken to bits. The others survived but had been dislodged from the styrofoam."
"Glasses have a good thickness to them.  Should hold up."
"Bought this glass set because I wanted to get rid of all my plastic cups because I prefer drinking out of glass and these cups mentioned that  they were made of good quality so I figured I would give them a try. Over all great set. Glass is sturdy not that cheap flimsy glass something you get at the store. East to clean no staining or no chipping so far. Dropped a glass in the sink as I was putting it in and didn’t crack or shatter which I was happy about. I’ve had other glasses that I bought and just by tapping something else the wrong way they would break. But happy with the glasses and I would definitely recommend"
"Perfect. Exactly as expected"
"Quality product , thickness is so perfect . We are looking for this kind of product . We are glad and happy to have one"
"Great quality, the glasses have a good weight to them"
"i don't like the look of the glass finish"
"Wish the simple design I chose would have come with a thin drinking edge."
"I just bought these and I throw out three already. These are easily broken. The mouth of them was chipped. Not sure what happened"
"I discovered that my old glass set was not meant to be cleaned in the dishwasher - and the designs were peeling off.  These look good, the sizes work and I can pop them in the dishwasher instead of hand washing them."
"These glasses are thick and quality glass. My kids tend to break glasses easily when they are doing dishes. They have not broken one of these glasses yet. The design is unique and they are a great addition to any kitchen."
"The glass itself is thicker, and I’ve had no problems with it. I had an earlier set. I think it was Libby or someone and it was so bad that I cut my hand a knuckle. It was so thin. It just broke so easy but these glasses are wonderful. Very good quality and a very reasonable price"
"I wasn't going to do a review because two of the glasses in this set were broken and I can't get a reaction from the goods store that they came from, but I decided to keep the ones I had just cause its a hassle to return things, I'm hoping they will send me some replacement glasses but we will see, the glasses are very nice however, nice set."
"We just received the glassware set!  All of them beautiful and beyond my expectations. We will be enjoying these hopefully for many years."
"Loved the glasses. However, shipping did not hold up. I bought two sets. On set large glasses were broken-bits of shattered glass leaked through the box and I had to clean up. The seller quickly returned new glasses and they too included broken glasses.  I would suggest that the seller revisit the way they ship this product. The glasses were double boxed with some large bubble wrap. Needs much better packaging. Those bits of glass hit the floor and animals could be harmed. Fortunately I was able to vacuum the floor before any damage done-again the glasses were of great quality, value, and appearance. Just be careful when opened"
"Packaged poorly. Arrived today with broken cups. Completely shattered. I was able to salvage some of them.  The cups that were not broken were heavy & nicely designed. Very happy with the cups."
"I love these things, especially after not having stackable glasses for so long! I recently downsized my unmatched glassware and bought a set of these to replace the cups that were culled.These glasses look great, are thick enough to be decently sturdy and I love the pattern on the sides. That being said, these ARE glass and I already have lost one to a careless child, but with concerns about plastic used for food service, I have been cutting out most of the plastics in my kitchen where feasible and these are great enough that I will buy a whole second set as soon as I have enough room for them,"
"These are heavy and don't feel like they'll chip easily. They look nice, too. We'll use them mostly for water... wine in a pinch ; )"
"We use these for every holiday table setting. Very durable and pretty. Perfect for all ages. Hold up well."
"Love these tea goblets. Have used this style for years since my first cruise experience. They add an air of class to any table. Great price and fast shipping. Buy them!"
"These are great goblets.  They have a sturdy base and a generous bowl.  They are heavy and well made.  They came exceptionally well packed - no chips, no cracks, no breakage."
"These glasses are a great quality. Nice and thick. Very well-made."
"These are great glasses, nice weight and multi purpose for formal or informal, iced water or iced tea etc. However, One glass did arrive broken. Working on receiving a replacement!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



These are perfect. Think, well packaged. Not one was broken. I like them. A little thicker and a little heavier than the store bought ones."
"I LOVE these glasses. I bought them to serve sangria in, because I didn’t want to use my good crystal wine glasses, and they’re so pretty I’ll be using them all the time. Great for ice tea, too, and they go with every style decor. Glasses came quickly and in perfect condition."
"Exactly what was pictured, reasonable price."
"Super Impressed!Not one crack or break on delivery! Only shipped in thick cardboard box, I thought for sure they would all br broke - Nope!! Not the one.Very sturdy thick glass!I will re-order! Love them!"
"They're the perfect size wine or water goblet or cocktail if you prefer.  Substantial weight that you won't knock over but a little elegance."
"Glasses nice and thick.. Encourage the kids to drink more water.. We all love them."
"This line has been my favorite for years, I love that I can use ice in this goblet and still have lots of space for water."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I ordered and returned several other brands (because the quality was terrible), before landing at these. These were the most affordable and the best quality! And I really inspect every detail. The “thickness” of the bottom part of the glass was important to me. I wanted rocks glasses that had a thicker bottom because I had ordered some other brands where the bottom was thinner and they had a cheaper look to them.. Other brands had a lot of rippling in the glass but the quality of these glasses were great.One of the glasses had a tiny flaw in the glass, but you wouldn’t notice unless you’re reallyyyy inspecting it, under the right lighting. I used all 12 to fulfill an order for a customer. I will DEFINITELY keep ordering these for my small business!"
"We needed a lot of glasses for a party and buying these was so much cheaper than renting from an event company. Classic all-purpose design.  And they’re well packed so no damage in shipping. Would totally buy again."
"Great glasses that are solid and very sturdy.  They are nice and simple."
"Weighted just right and a nice feel"
"Just like the description these are heavy bottom glasses they feel more stable and do not tip off easily when bumped accidentally. They are very good all around glasses whether used for water or for scotch"
"Good quality but concerned about thin rim chipping in future."
"These glasses are excellent. Little story. One fell on concrete and still didn’t break. Thanks seller excellent product."
"I purchased these to replace a couple that had been broken.  Well packaged and slightly smaller diameter than indicated in the photos.  A perfect match to my existing set.  Actual diameter is a hair under 3⅛""."
"We had an older set of these glasses and over the years, several had been broken.  No other manufacturer makes an exact match, so we had to order the Libbey 918CD model -- really nice glasses, but very expensive -- probably 3 or 4 times what we paid for our older set."
"These glasses actually hold only 10 oz, when filled to the brim.  The description says Libbey's 11 oz."
"These glasses are very sturdy and have a nice feel and weight to them."
"Great quality. Good size for water or juice. Nice feel in the hand. Great value for the price"
"we are down to 2 glasses out of the dozen in a few months. I know they are made of ""glass""  but we have other sets, including wine glasses, that have survived years of clinking in the dishwasher and bumps in the sink. These glasses have a thin rim and almost every one that broke has the same shape piece come off. Many broke just going through a dishwasher cycle."
"The Marquis by Waterford Markham Double Old Fashioned Set is simply exquisite! These glasses are the perfect combination of elegance and functionality. The crystal-clear glass and beautiful cut design make them a stunning addition to any bar or dining table. They have a nice weight to them, giving a luxurious feel when holding them, and the 11 oz capacity is just right for enjoying a generous pour of whiskey, cocktails, or any beverage of choice. The craftsmanship is outstanding, with each glass showcasing Waterford’s signature quality and attention to detail. Whether for everyday use or special occasions, these glasses elevate the drinking experience. They also make a fantastic gift! Highly recommend this set for anyone who appreciates fine glassware."
"These have comfortable feel and weight, great design--downside is if you put them in dishwasher they will discolor--says so on instructions and is true"
"These glasses reflect the light beautifully, are a nice weight, and perfect size. And a great price too. I couldn't be happier."
"The author of the description has been very truthful and meticulous to let you know everything you need to know about these.  You need to read ALL of it.  What I am referring to is that these lovely glasses are not the razor-sharp hand cut Waterford of yesteryear that some of us remember.  These are not hand cut and are not made in Ireland.  They ARE machine cut and come from Italy, but DO feature the Waterford stamp.  They are indeed lovely and are a value version of the very expensive forerunners.  I am very happy with mine -  in fact, they are for a gift and will be lovely.  Just don't be surprised when you go to inspect them & you don't cut your fingers.  A+++. Great value and still happy!"
"Nice looking glasses which arrived well packaged and protected. Look and feel like expensive crystal. Machine washable but recommend hand washing to maintain clarity. Ice sounds wonderful in these glasses. Very happy with this purchase."
"Took me several tries to find my definitive whiskey glass - These were the closest for the money. Quite adequate until you compare them to high-end crystal (so don't). Curious to realize the exact design in next level crystal - Enjoying them regardless of my nits.Pros:* Decent weight, neither heavy nor light* Nice refractions, enhance the look of the whiskey* Seem durable, without feeling like plastic* Lip not too thick but not quite thin enough eitherCons:* Cannot unsee the circumference seams at each third."
"These look very expensive and they are a fraction of the price of the rest of the Waterford collection. However they are so heavy that they are virtually unbreakable.  Love these!!!"
"This glassware is used every day for every meal."
"Lovely glasses"
"Bought two sets, one came broken on each box. Quality is not great. They’re too thick and don’t even look like crystal."
"Love the height of the overall glass and the long stemware makes it special.  I did find the glass is a bit heavy in weight so it makes it a bit more like glassware than crystal."
"I DID NOT GET AN AUTHENTICITY CERTIFICATE...JESUINHO"
"good quality"
"Like the cut of these. Very unusual."
"I like that these ribbed glasses are stackable. I can stack them (no more than one on top of the other) and make more room in cabinets for other glassware. They are lightweight and sort of thin and not as thick as I had hoped. The clarity is okay, it is not bad, but it is not pristine either. Finally, the main highlights are that these stackable highball glasses have that popular ribbed design and are affordably priced."
"I recently received this set of ""Ribbed Drinking Glasses set of 6, 14oz Vintage Glass Cups,Elegant Ribbed Glassware,Highball Glasses,Clear Glass Tumbler,Cocktail Glasses,Iced Coffee Cup for Water, Beer,Juice,Mojito,Decor,Gift"" to accompany a similarly styled set of ribbed tumblers.This set came very well packaged in a box with double foam protection with cutouts for both the tops of the cups as well as the narrower bases.  No signs of damage and I have to say that I appreciate the extra steps.  On top of that, despite the box being somewhat plain, it was still nice enough that this set would be a great gift idea (think: Housewarming Present).These glasses aren't huge, being only 14oz., but they're big enough for general daily use.  A canned soda (or beer) is typically 12oz., and that extra 2oz. should be enough for a couple of ice cubes.  Also, because they're made of boroscilicate glass, they can be popped in the freezer for those times when ""a frosty one"" is called for without fear of the glass breaking.  ;-)This set of six ribbed drinking glasses is priced at $34.99 as I type this review, but is also marked down 29%, lowering the price to $24.99.  But wait!  There's more!  There's an additional 20% coupon right now, which then lowers the price another $5.00, putting this half-dozen glasses at $19.99.  Hard to knock promo pricing like that, honestly, and that makes me even happier to recommend these glasses to others."
"I’m really digging these ribbed drinking glasses* They have such a cool, ultra-modern look that instantly elevates my kitchen. The ribbed texture gives them a unique feel, and the shape is sleek and a bit different from your usual glass, which makes them stand out. They’re also the perfect size for pretty much any drink, and I love how sturdy they feel in hand without being too thick/heavy. Definitely a stylish addition to my barware collection. If you’re looking for glasses that are both functional and stylish, these are a great pick!"
"These ribbed glasses are nice. I’ve used them for iced coffee and they feel sturdy without being too heavy. The vintage design adds a nice touch to my table setup. They’re easy to clean and have held up well after several uses."
"These glasses are cute but very very thin and light.They don’t feel hefty in your hands and the drinking experience is not as pleasant.They are supposed to be stackable but because it’s so thin, I fear that they will break if they get stuck to each other.  I’m not crazy about these."
"I have three kids and we go through glasses pretty quickly whether it’s durability or they get fogged up in the dishwasher or lost or dropped or whatever. I thought these were super cute so I snagged a box of them. I do love how they look. My only concern is that the glass is pretty thin and lightweight and I’m fairly certain they’re gonna get broken easily in our house. The transition from sink to dishwasher when you have kids is a little dangerous for glassware, and since my kids do the dishes, I am a little concerned about the durability of these glasses. Time will tell and I will update my review. Other than that, they are great! They look super cute. They are uniform size and shape, and the clearness of the glasses is good. I just worry that they are a little thin and lightweight for a household with kids."
"This is a very attractive set of six vintage style ribbed 14 ounce drinking glasses.  Perfect for dinner guests, casual affairs, or for everyday use.  The glass is thick and durable, a blast from the past in regards to style, perfect for gifts or setting up home for the first time, always a welcomed addition to your glass collection to select from for serving the perfect drink from the correct type of glass."
"First I wanted to thank the company, Zulay Kitchen, for the care they did to pack EACH glass in bubble wrap and NOT putting adhesive stickers right on the glass, which is so hard to get off!  The glass looks beautiful, has a sturdy bottom and is dishwasher safe.I highly recommend them !!!"
"They are a lot bigger than I thought they would be. I love the color, and seem nice and sturdy. They do stack, but they kinda get stuck on each other, and stacking them makes them really tall. So you are better off just not stacking them. I am happy with the plastic glasses!"
"These are holding up well with daily use.  They do break easily if dropped on the floor by kids.  Otherwise, Iâ€™ve gotten a lot of compliments on them."
"Good quality. Perfect on our boat as donâ€™t have to worry about glass breaking. Wash well"
"L9ve these. They are so pretty & look like glass. Nice & thin, comfortable to hold. Perfect size"
"Lightweight, clear, good quality."
"My husband thought it was real glass. You pick them up they are very lite weight. They look like real glass and high end. Package very well to no broken ones."
"I bought these cups last year, and when they were new they looked great! However over time they are getting scratched, certain things stick to them/they donâ€™t always come clean from the dishwasher. I wish they had held up a little better."
"Like the look of them, in fact we ordered a second set and use them for everyday. Nice sizes."
"Started using these glasses immediately after delivery.  Set them up in my Airbnb apartment, and they are perfect.  Sturdy, holds a lot of volume, and overall has a great, high quality feel.  Excellent value for the price.  Would buy again in the future."
"Glad we ordered these glasses, they have a nice quality and size to them.  They look nice and feel good in the hand."
"Wish I had ordered these sooner. The glass is not thin and cheap. Dishwasher safe. Sturdy but not heavy. Arrived perfectly. No flaws."
"Bought these to etch some design into them for coaches gifts. They are very simple and nice looking. Good quality."
"Outstanding for the price. Clear glass. No problem in the dishwasher."
"These glasses are great! They are nice and heavy, not chintzy or cheap. They look lovely, and I appreciate the great quality."
"This have been great for our family. They are a wonderful size, and they are a classic drinking glass. Very practical!We had glasses before that would never come clean in the dishwasher, and ain‚Äôt nobody for time for that! Bought these hoping they would wash up better in the dishwasher, and they do! They usually come out sparkling clean, occasionally with some smudges still, but I honestly think those outliers are due to poor placement in the dishwasher. Super helpful to have daughter help me do the dishes! Sometimes they don‚Äôt put them in the washer where I would though. It‚Äôs a give and take‚Ä¶ parents know what I mean.So, gave it 4 stars because these are nice, classic, basic glasses and because they come clean way more easily than my last set of glasses. Why not 5 stars? They are just basic. Nothing to make them pretty, stylish, or outside or the ordinary. Craftsmanship is nice though, they arrived on time, they arrived in perfect condition and I highly recommend them!"
"Very nice drinking glasses to add to my collection"

"Exactly what I was looking for and very happy with them.  They feel very sturdy and seem like they will last."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



The reason for the four-star is because they are good glasses but as you can see from the video there was one glass that had a crack in it. This is probably no-fault a manufacturing I‚Äôm guessing it was the Amazon delivery driver or during transport.  It isn‚Äôt worth my while to try and send them back and get a refund as it is only one glass but the quality seems to be there overall"
"These are very sturdy and well made. They're the perfect size as well!"
"The best bar accessories! This also came with a cocktail recipe book, which is a great resource for a quick guide on how to master your favorite drinks"
"This has almost everything your need in a small package. Nice dark wood stain, easy to us of you know what your looking for, ba perfect gift for anyone! Only wish it had sizes engraved on the jiggers for easy use on measurements ha ha. Great bang for your buck."
"I did not use this product it looks great but it was bought for a gift"
"I gave this as a gift to my husband. He loved it. It's very Ratpackesque. The pieces are sturdy and heavy. The tray doesn't look cheap and it has almost everything a home bar needs. We are very pleased with it."
"Great quality. Great price. This is comparable to the very expensive name brands."
"Works, looks nice, and does its purpose. Pretty close to money well spent."
"Quality seems durable and the size is perfect for my office coffee/liquor bar! I’ve made a couple delicious cocktails so far with it and the performance of the shaker and strainer held up nicely! Doesn’t feel cheap at all. Everything went together well right out of the box! All holes lined up for all parts. Two thumbs up!"
"I recently turned a sideboard into a bar, and wanted a compact bar kit. This kit has it all! Everything but the liquor. And the base that houses everything is surprisingly sturdy, compact, and visually appealing. I highly recommend this product!"
"Love this for starting out a bar cart! Everything works really well. Convenient that everything can be stored together. Looks aesthetically pleasing. My husband loved receiving this as a gift and uses it often!"
"This little kit has everything that you need for starters. I‚Äôm training to be a bartender so I got this to practice at home. I like everything except for the jiggers only because they‚Äôre different from the one I use at work. Quality is nice. The stand doesn‚Äôt hold the bar spoon very well but that‚Äôs all I have as far as opinion lol it‚Äôs a really nice set, can‚Äôt beat the price and quality!"
"Have everything I need to make the perfect mix. The look is classic on my counter top but is still portable to other spaces. The recipe book is a added bonus. Great quality for cost."
"Worked fabulous at my party"
"The base/stand is pretty cheaply constructed, but looks nice enough on the shelf.  Others complained about the stability of some of the items staying put in the stand.  Hasn‚Äôt been an issue for me, but I don‚Äôt expect much from a set that mostly just sits on a shel out of the way.  Probably wouldn‚Äôt stay out in an earthquake though. LOLIf you‚Äôre looking for basic functionality, this works.  Would suggest spending a little more for the fancier, more quality versions if you‚Äôre hoping to show off both your bar and your mixology skills."
"Upped my game as a bartender"
"Decent quality, doesn‚Äôt tarnish and perfect for a at home barmaid kit"
"jigger is not good and I couldn't find what's the capacity  on each side ; there also don't have detail on the website..."
"everything you need to make cocktails"
"Great kit for making cocktails"
"Works perfect for making drink garnishes. Easy to use and clean."
"Cuts a nice garnish. Well made. Very happy."
"Very fine product. Weighted handle makes it easy to use and the tip is very sturdy."
"Works great for really pithy lemons and oranges, nice long curls. Thin pith lemons and limes in general not so much"
"Really sharp, so be careful out of the box. Works well, will see how the wood handle holds up over time."
"A fantastic accessory for any cocktail maker. Simple and elegant design. good value!"
"I purchased the Viski Channel Knife, Cocktail Garnish Citrus Zester, and my experience with this bar tool has been quite disappointing. While it may have an appealing appearance with its walnut wood and stainless steel construction, the actual performance and quality are far from satisfactory.Despite its attractive appearance, the overall build quality is subpar. The tool feels flimsy and lacks the durability expected from a bar accessory. When it comes to its primary purpose, which is zesting or garnishing citrus for cocktails, the Viski Channel Knife falls short. The blade is not as sharp as it should be, making it a struggle to achieve clean and precise zests. This can result in messy and uneven garnishes.In conclusion, the Viski Channel Knife has been a letdown. While it may have an appealing design, it ultimately fails to deliver on the most important aspects of a bar tool: functionality and durability. I cannot recommend this product, especially considering its relatively high cost. There are better alternatives on the market that provide a more satisfying experience for cocktail enthusiasts."
"Feels like a very real kitchen tool. Metal and wood build feels like it will last a long time. Tested on fruit numerous times now and have no problems with sharpness at all!"
"Bought one and thought it was a malfunction.  Nothing on the blade section to stop it from rotating. Ordered another and same thing.  Poor quality!"
"Great product and worth the price. The wooden handle seems untreated so I rubbed a bit of my cutting board mineral oil into the handle and now it looks even better!"
"This is an excellent, must have tool in the kitchen.  I have had many zesters in the past - this one is the best I have ever used, very well made, and worth the price."
"This is the perfect knife for making cocktail garnishes!"
"Excellent solid glass does exactly what it's supposed to do. You can read the measurements on the side perfectly. You don't have to squint or get a maginifying glass to read the #'s on the side in black. We use this to measure our hot tub chemicals. And it works perfectly. I would definitely recommend it and I would purchase it again. It was an excellent design.  An perfectly priced! I may purchase another one! The weight is solid durable.If he dropped at once, it probably would not break.You can tell it's a well made product"
"This measure is awesome. It has markings for ml, oz, tsp, and tbs. Has a spout for pourability . Nice product."
"I have multiple of these.  The writing on the side is super dark and easy to read.  Ass is a thicker quality so not easy to break."
"This is perfect and just what I was looking for! Love that itâ€™s glass and has a bunch of different measurements"
"This is a no-nonsense bar and kitchen tool: surprisingly thick glass, with a heavy bottom.  Put it down on a countertop, and you can pour stuff into it without worrying about tipping it.  Sharp, black markings are easy to read in normal light. If you have a dimly-lit bar area, the black markings might not be ideal, but the straight sides allow you to guesstimate fairly accurately, which is hard to do with those conical steel jiggers.  (If those things really are ""preferred by professionals,"" it's *because* they're hard to use!)"
"These are great measuring glasses!  This is our second set.  The only problem is that the measuring marks wear off after going in the dishwasher too many times.  We hand wash ours, but we would love the convenience of putting them in the dishwasher."
"Measuring small amounts of liquid, is a PITA with standard measuring cups.  This makes it ease to measure fractions of onces (up to 3+) or milliiters.  I use it all the time for mixing drinks."
"Perfect for mixing maugaritas"
"I love that this shot glass is larger than most and can handle liquids easily for several drinks at one time."
"I purchased this to measure alcohol. I own shot glasses and had no idea what size they were. All these years I thought I was drinking 1oz drinks, but it turns out they are actually 2oz. Thanks to this measuring glass now I know. No wonder my liver enzymes were so high."
"After just one dishwasher wash all the printed measurements disappeared, so this glass is useless nowðŸ˜ž"
"This product is exactly as it appears. The glass is thick so unlikely to break easily. The spout for pouring works well. No problems so far. Highly recommend."
"I purchased this stainless steel mixing glass after a crystal mixing glass I purchased (different brand) cracked merely from ice sitting in it after 2 1/2 weeks of use. I wanted something durable so I looked into this stainless steel mixing glass.I like it a lot and I'll give it 5 stars because it achieves the thing I was looking for. Durability. I don't have to worry about this thing cracking on me from temperature changes. With that said, there are a few things of note about this mixing glass.First is that it is not actually a circular opening. It is slightly ovular. It was hard for me to notice at first glance. I was initially disappointed because I thought my julip strainer didn't fit it, but then I noticed that the strainer would fit if used perpendicular to the pour spout instead of parallel like I was used to doing. So keep that in mind.Second, is it is much noisier than a crystal mixing glass. The back of the metal stirring spoon abrades against the inside of this stainless steel pitcher. Scratches develop very quickly on your spoon but that's nothing to worry about. However, the friction means that the stirring motion isn't the pleasant glide that you would get from a crystal mixing glass. But you're not buying this thing for aesthetic charm or texture, you're buying it for rugged durability.Third, because it is made of metal, the ice cubes want to stick to the bottom and sides of the glass before you start stirring especially if you are using a lot of smaller cubes with more points of direct contact against the metal. So it takes a little bit more force to get the ice moving.Once you get used to these things though, this is a perfectly functional, HIGHLY durable mixing glass. Overall, I think the crystal mixing glasses are far more enjoyable to use, but they come with a very high risk of cracking. At the end of the day, this stainless steel mixing glass gets the job done even if it isn't as pretty."
"I like to mix my old fashion drink in this glass.  It is very well made, and has a good looking design on the glass.  It is easy to clean, and works great if I am mixing one, two or three dinks.  The capacity, even with ice is very good.  I enjoy using it."
"I have purchased other Viski products and am generally pleased with them. This is a little retro in its elegant styling and has a nice weight to it. I have a Viski shaker in gunmetal color that I love. When I started exploring gin martinis, I wanted something I could stir a metal spoon inside without scratching it. This mixing glass with a 15"" Viski spoon makes a nice combination. It elevates the experience."
"This is a nice-looking mixing glass that is 23 ounces, not 18 ounces as originally advertised in the header's description.  This has been corrected subsequent to my purchase.  Otherwise, it is exactly as described.  A slightly smaller glass with a narrower diameter would be nice.  This glass can be difficult to hold while holding a strainer in place with the same hand."
"Heavy duty, feels quality."
"I’ve become an amateur mixologist the last couple years. Started following recipes exactly so to make sure I’m doing the drink justice. Fact is, you need to stir, not shake certain drinks to obtain the right flavors and texture. This does that and it looks good in my bar shelf."
"Feels great, smooth with no seams inside.The base is heavy to keep the glass still when mixing, Good size too.Very pleased"
"The right sized beeker for mixing drinks and cocktails. Great pour point. Nice heavy base. Looks more expensive than it is. Perfect for stirred cocktail mixes."
"Stirred drinks, you can get by stirring them in the glass or in the shaker tin, but if you enjoy the bar stuff, there's nothing like this large clear vessel with its thick bottom, you don't have to hold it, it's heavy enough not to move and you can thoroughly stir your drinks. And it really is a major conversation piece 😁"
"No complaints. Decent pour on it, which is a complaint of a couple of other mixing jugs on here.Looks good and does the job."
"Here's everything you need to know about this mixing glass:- It's NOT 23 oz! It's more like 17 oz (approx. 550 ml), but trust me, you don't want anything bigger than that if you're just mixing one or two drinks at a time. 17 oz is the industry standard, so this is actually better (unless you're really looking for a 23 oz glass)- It's heavy enough. This mixing glass will not move around once the ice is in there (unless you're stirring like a caveman). Big win.- It's not a seamless glass, but the seam does not run all the way to the bottom of the glass, so you won't get an annoying clicking sound while stirring. No need to spend the extra money on a seamless one if you're just starting out- The glass isn't perfect, there are a few tiny bubbles, but you won't notice them from a distance. Other than that, the glass feels sturdy. Function over form!Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I think you will be too"
"I had been looking for a good bartending kit for a while and I am not disappointed with this one.  Elegant, well presented with the stand, sturdy and practical."
"Nice quality. Looks great on bar! I highly recommend."
"The weight and quality of each of the tools is great.  The stand looks nice and helps keep things organized on the bar top.  Not sure if/when I'll use the pourers, but I like the option to have them.Would like to have some more classic cocktails in the recipe bookLooking forward to putting this to use."
"Ordered many sets and chose this one.  It has everything you need to make great cocktails!!  Love the shaker - feel like a bartender!!"
"Great quality product we love it"
"This is all you need"
"Good quality, has everything and more for the home bartender, all in an aesthetically pleasing counter piece."
"Without overkill offering countless never to be used pieces, this product seems just right for my needs."
"I looked at a lot of different barware kits before buying this one.  The price is on par with all the others, so that was not a big factor.Not all kits have a peeler for garnishes.  This one does, and it works really well.The caddy stores everything  well, and makes it easy to transport in and out of your cupboard if you don't have a space to keep it out all the time (e.g. if your ""bar"" is also your kitchen).The only thing missing is a channel knife for making lemon twists.  And to make it absolutely perfect, it could use a 0.25 oz marking on the jigger.  (Note:  Etens does make another jigger which does have a 0.25 oz marking, so I bought one of them -- having two jiggers isn't a bad idea anyway).I paired the kit with a mixing glass from A Bar Above.  That, plus the channel knife, and my bar is fully equipped and makes great drinks."
"Purchased for use during holidays. And into 2025 and beyond. My 20 something family members are seriously into cocktails and recipes. I finally have a bar set. To go on my counter. Or outside in spring / summer.  Woukd also make a perfect gift. Three year No Rust warranty.  Looks very good in stand. Iâ€™ll toast to that. Cheers!"
"I really liked this 16 piece bartending kit from barebarrel . Excellent product, easy to use and great quality!"
"I really like this cocktail mixing set. I've often thought of myself as a mixologist ðŸ¤—, now I truly feel like one! This is a 16 piece, stainless steel set, some items like the wine corks have black accents. Its a high quality set, durable everything from the shaker to the stirers etc. are good quality. Its an ideal size for a countertop, mini bar etc. it comes with a caddy, but I don't personally like it. It is made from wood, sturdy keeps everything in its place. What I don't like is that for me it cheapens the look of the set. I wish it came with a black caddy or at least the option to choose. Its not a deal breaker but a preference. Good value and  comes with a cocktail booklet so you too can easily become an at home bartender.Also comes with a rust proof guarantee and customer service website right on the box!"
"I absolutely love this set! It comes with every thing you need for your home bar! I highly recommend this set."
"Looks very nice in my home bar"
"This is an excellent, premium and professional -looking and -feeling set of drink-making tools that's very well-made and excellent to hold and use. Every piece fits together perfectly and fit well into the places in the bamboo rack that are designed to hold them. The cocktail recipe cards are also very well-made from thick paper and given on a twine string that fits well into a space in the base. I like how it looks and feels, it fits in perfectly at a private bar and it looks great in almost any setting. This includes everything you could realistically want if you're looking to get into cocktail mixing and creation, or for practicing your skills!The zester is the one exception to the professional look. If you look up close at the part where the zester connects to its handle, you can see how it's connected together, which is something that isn't an issue on any of the other pieces. Since it doesn't affect how well it works and it still looks nice overall I'm not counting that as a significant negative. The small little cleaner brush is also quite small, as well, but it doesn't need to be larger to work well. I'm not a fan of the basic little rubber covers that go over the liquor pourers, but they do the job.Almost everything in this kit is made of pure stainless steel - in fact, the only parts I can find that aren't steel are the silicone parts on the stoppers, the rubber stopper covers, and the bamboo rack. I don't know what grade of steel they're made from, but they're holding up well to use for various drinks and they've been put through the dishwasher a few times now with no visible changes. I'm confident they're durable enough to last a long time, as long as they're taken care of properly - don't leave them wet for long periods of time when not in use.Everything works exactly as you'd want them to work. The cobbler shaker fits together easily and doesn't leak, the liquor pourers both work perfectly to pour out liquor or flavored syrups quickly with no dripping, the mesh strainer has fine mesh and can hold a sizeable amount of solids, the Hawthorne strainer is great for quick straining while you're pouring out drinks, and the bottle stoppers work well for several sizes of bottles - anything that could use a standard cork.Overall, this is an excellent set of barkeeper tools that I'm going to keep using for long while. I'll update this review if any issues with any of them pop up down the line.I only review things that I personally use myself on a regular and continued basis. I always give my full, honest, unbiased and unfiltered opinion on everything I review. I will not hold back or avoid describing any issues I have with a product. I write exactly what I think about things - the good, the bad, the ugly, and the questionable. And, I will update my review if something breaks, stops working as intended, or otherwise doesn't hold up as expected."
"What an amazing, comprehensive bartending kit! It has so many useful elements and they're all compiled in one set. While one would expect a jigger, cobbler shaker, strainer and corkscrew, it has a 2nd type of strainer, knife on the corkscrew to cut through tough bottle seals, an ice scoop and bottle stops. It even has the liquor pour spouts. Not the ones that pour only a shot at a time but guides to help you pour straight and not spill. A zester and muddler are great to have but not always something one thinks of picking up. They're also not always available in stores. Iâ€™m not a huge drinker and only sporadically entertain where lots of cocktails are involved but his has everything I need to serve up a wide range of drinks and do so easily. They've not only included cocktail cards with instructions on how to prepare various drinks but the cards are tied together so you won't misplace any. They include a small pipe cleaner with the deck to keep the liquor pourers clean. There's a small wooden rack to house all the elements together. This would make an excellent gift that would be convenient for the host or for guests to use to serve themselves. I did have a bit of a tussle getting the cap off the cobbler tumbler but just making a mental note not to push down on it too hard should solve the problem going forward. It's silver and supposedly dishwasher safe, though I haven't tried in the dishwasher. I didn't really have an issue having items soak a little in hot water and cleaning by hand."
"Not only does this set have the most-used tools for cocktail making, I especially liked that they are corralled in an attractive, custom sized wooden holder. The holder makes them easy to see and use as well as store. The branding is subtly added too, not emblazoned garishly across the whole thing.  Nicely done!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Absolutely love this set it has everything you need to make delicious cocktails at home and looks fab on display on my garden barI went for the silver in particular as it is dishwasher safeThank you @barebarrelFrom @jintylovesfood x"

What an amazing product well recommended."
"This Cocktail Making Kit is an exceptional choice for both beginners and cocktail enthusiasts. This 16-piece set has everything you need to mix up any cocktail, from classics to creative concoctions. The 675ml (24oz) cobbler shaker is well-sized and has a sleek charcoal/gray finish that looks stylish in any kitchen or bar area. All pieces are sturdy, well-crafted, and designed to last, which impressed me.The display stand is a nice touch, keeping everything organized and easy to access. The 35 recipe cards included are a fun bonusâ€”they cover a wide range of cocktails, perfect for trying something new. This kit is also very user-friendly; even as a beginner, I found it easy to use and clean. It makes for a fantastic gift, too, thanks to its quality and presentation. Highly recommended for anyone looking to elevate their home bartending game!"
"This cocktail making set covers everything you need to get started. Its made of stainless steel so should be resistant to rusting.The whole set has a nice bamboo stand that you can display your equipment if you like. You also get 35 cards detailing how to make cocktails.4 stars from me. Good set and ideal as a gift."
"Me and my partner love a cocktail night so jumped at the opportunity of getting this set!The kit comes neatly packaged with each individual item wrapped in paper to protect the metal finish. As I unpacked the set, I slotted each item into its corresponding spot in the base and they all fit perfectly.Even when we're not using it, this set has a permanent place on our kitchen countertop because it looks beautiful! The stainless steel has a very appealing finish that catches the light perfectly looks amazing on show.Practicality-wise, this set has it all. We've used the muddler for mint leaves for a Mojito, we've used the strain to pour drinks that required mashed fruit, we've used the shaker for mixing each cocktail, etc.The set even comes with a pack of cocktail recipes if you want to try something new!This set will come in handy (and take a beating) come this Christmas period, and I recommend to anyone in the same boat who plans to experiment with new cocktails this Christmas."
"This is great quality kit for the price. The wood frame is sturdy, well-shaped, and looks good. The kit itself is of nice quality, shiny, and solid. My only complaint is that the cap on the cocktail shaker gets stuck very easily and is hard to remove. I would buy this again, especially as a gift. It's a nice addition to our bar cart, and it looks more expensive than it is. Miniature is in the picture for scale (but not included with the product!)."
"This isnt that great of a picture but i havent used these yet. theyre very good quality for the price!! So cute to display aswell and everything came together well! Very easy to use:) nothing was missing and everything fit perfectly! im happy💌"
"I bought this for my bar station and it has everything I need to mix drinks and make what I want. The stainless steel makes it look high quality and it doesn’t feel cheap either. I also appreciate the little book on ingredients to make mix drinks that comes with it."
"Great for the price. I put 4 stars because one of the items came broken. Other than that it was good."
"I am amazed with this bartenders utensil set. At such a low price and such high quality it’s a beautiful purchase. There’s not anything that I will have to add to have everything needed to make our favorite cocktails. I will be purchasing this set for gifts for friends and family…everything from housewarming gifts to birthdays and everything in between."
"it's got all the stuff I was hoping for and it stores really nicely.  great price and great look!"
"Item as described, good quality, fast delivery"
"I just started bartending and I wanted to get these for home so I could practice and be able to make friends drinks, they are very nice and great quality, is has a few different drink recipes that are easy to follow, and everything is easy to use and clean, I love it!"
"This citrus peeler and zester tool is a must-have for any home bartender or chef. The specially designed channel knife makes it easy to peel citrus fruits, while the ultra-sharp zester holes are perfect for creating citrus zest and garnishes. The non-slip grip of the soft-touch handle provides a comfortable and secure grip, and the hanging loop is designed for easy storage. This tool is durable and easy to clean, and it is dishwasher safe for added convenience.I used this tool to make Old Fashions for my Christmas party, and it was a big hit. The ultra-sharp zester holes made it easy to zest the citrus, and the specially designed channel knife made it easy to peel the fruit. The tool is also quiet and easy to use, making it perfect for entertaining guests. Overall, I would highly recommend this tool to anyone looking for a durable, high-quality, and versatile option for their kitchen or bar."
"The handle fits wonderfully in your hand. Great grip peels well."
"This handy kitchen device can take a lemon and cut a large-shoelace-like strip of the peel.  Really nice for a martini.  In addition it can make a set of tiny rind strips using the little holes.  That said, when you get it the big strip maker comes VERY dull.  This made it difficult to produce these strips without a struggle.  However, if you can locate a 1/8"" round metal file, the cutting edge can be dramatically sharpened and the thing then works much better!"
"Did the job well"
"I used it once in the last two years. I chose this one because it was the lowest-priced Amazon option.  It worked perfectly because it's a commodity item.  More expensive options wouldn't work any differently."
"compact, comfortable to hold in your hand, non-slip"
"Professional restaurant Quality! spent over 25 years in the food service industry and have held every position from Dishwasher to Executive Chef to Director of Food Services. Fully recommended for Mixologist as well as a Pastry Chef without hesitation!"
"Always wanted one"
"Excellent product easy to use"
"No more knuckle skin in my lemon baked goods. Much better and easier to use than a cheese grater. Allows you to zest around any bad parts of the peel. Makes long skinny strips of zest that I then chop finely with a knife a cutting board. A million times easier to clean than a grater."
"Cozy and warm but not too heavy or thick. Love the emerald green!"
"It's very cozy, no bad smell when opened, vacuum packed well, shipped fast. It's not very heavy, but it's warm."
"Bought this for my son who loves purple. It's heavy, fluffy & warm. Has been washed several times & holds it shape very well. Great product."
"Super soft fabric. Machine washes well. Light weight but keeps you warm."
"I had a hard time believing that this comforter would be warm enough on cold nights, especially after seeing it wasn’t as thick as expected. However, I’m delighted with it! Perfect Cal King size, nice soft fabric, neutral gray and a great value for the money! I recommend getting a cover for it to keep it looking fresh even through it is washable. I found a nice cover on Amazon with the same brushed soft feel and it’s great!!"
"Arrived on time in good condition. Not very thick for northern climates but does good here in zone 5."
"Bought it for a full bed and the length on the sides did not reach half way down. I think the King would give more coverage on the sides. Washed it by itself the minute I unpacked it. The tag got dyed red after washing, so be aware of it. The red color is ok, not as bright, but acceptable. Would not had bought it if I were to have seen it before."
"First of all, my wife was coming home from a surgery today. I use Amazon because I was able to get something in a few days. We have been using another ""comforter"" from Amazon for like a year already. It was time to replace it as why wash it after she used an iron on it numerous times haha! I know the pics usually show a fluffed up cover, and no this is not thick people! It is just fine as a blanket however and I ordered a queen and that's what I received. We have a Therapedic queen on a full framed in bed that is also fully adjustable. The cover fits fine, as pic'd. The blanket arrived completely vacuumed sealed yes, I carefully opened and it say for an hour. I shook it and placed in dryer no heat for 20 mins and placed it on clean linens. I did smooth it out and tucked in the end. No smells whatever (?) I put my big nose on it many times and no smells. The color is just like I figured and the texture is great. The fit is just like the last one...perfect. If you want bigger then buy bigger. The stitches show no problems and I looked it all over twice! Now, that said I cannot say what will happen in a standard washing situation. The last one I washed and yes got a few lumps, but smooth out with hands and after a few bed makings they went away enough to keep using it. However, this is an inexpensive purchase and may not be right for those that expect frequent washings and a big thick comforter. I am happy to not have to parade around retail stores until my feet hurt just to find something better. For now these covers will have kept us warm and covered just fine until maybe one day we find a better option. I would buy another one no problem. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the purchase and I don't usually give reviews. However, after spending more time checking reviews on Amazon and needing a new bed cover asap. I feel compelled to say this cover is just fine."
"Awesome product. Totally worth buying."

I purchased this for my son because he gets so hot while sleeping but there are times it’s so cold in his room. The material is nice and soft. I expected it to look like a comforter for a dorm room.  It was full of static so I recommend planning ahead and leaving time to wash it before using.  The colors weee nice a bright. Sometimes black can be a weird shade. But both sides were nice colors. This is great for people who want a comforter like bead spread year round. I really like how lightweight it is.  I feel like it will be one of those blankets that are nice and cool to lay with while the air conditioning is on and warm and comforting when it’s 20 degrees outside. The price was reasonable for a full/queen and it’s definitely big enough for a queen.  As long as it washes up nicely I think it’s one of my favorite buys.  I may buy another for the Airbnb. I think it’s perfect for everyone."
"I’ve had this same comforter before, about 5 years ago before I moved out of the country, and I moved back like 3 years ago. I bought it again because I remember liking how durable and comfortable this comforter is, breathable but warm. I’ve been using a duvet with a black cover for a little while, and while the duvet is nice and thick and cozy, the fact of the matter is both the duvet and the cover were in terrible shape, and the king size duvet cover still felt too small for the queen size duvet somehow (unless I was given a different size duvet than it said on the label). I got rid of those because it was bugging me how it fit on the bed, and the fact that it didn’t stay decent for long. This comforter is so much easier to wash anyway, and I’m really glad I re-bought it. Washed it a few days ago, so it smells like fresh laundry. Laying on it right now, and ahhh 😌 that’s so much better! I definitely recommend this comforter!! It’s not fancy hotel quality or anything, but, it’s really nice for the home if you’re looking for something affordable, but decent quality."
"This is a nice lightweight comforter.Equal to the value for quality.  It is perfect for summer, a kids room. I have mine in the guest room over a day bed. It is easy to wash and there was no odor when I opened it. This is not heavy duty. The size is perfect just as described and it is not overly soft but has a nice smooth fabric."
"does the job of keeping me warm without feeling like a ton of bricks on top of me."
"Very nice reversible blanket. Very comfortable and keeps me warm."
"Okay product but not good for winterDoes not feel comfortable with this one.Quality not so impressiveI definitely not recommend this item."
"This is my 3rd one of these comforters.  The price is good, I figured if they only lasted a year it was a great buy.  However, I bought the first 2 over 2 years ago in 2015; the black/gray for my oldest grandson, and the orange/brown for my 2nd grandson. They are a med weight comforter, which is great for my hot blooded grandson as well as the cooler grandson.  Also my daughter is able to fit both comforters in her washer at once.  Some of the thicker comforters would be too crowded and not wash or dry as efficiently.  BUT here is the REALLY BIG DEAL about these comforters..  My grandsons are extremely HARD on everything!!!  BUT these comforters have truly  stood up to all that my grandsons have dished out.  For the first few months, one of the comforters was washed several times a week, sometimes daily,  due to bedwetting, ALSO  my daughter is regular about changing her household beds every other week, so they are still being washed quite frequently and they have absolutely stood the test!  They still look and feel great.  The colors have not faded, they haven't lost their shape, no shrinkage, the batting is still in great shape, no pilling, or napping.  They come out of the dryer wrinkle free.  What more can you ask for?  And at this price???  So now that grandson number 3 has graduated into a ""big boy bed"" I was very glad to find that Amazon was still offering these comforters and I have just purchased our 3rd one, this time in the two shades of blue.  My daughter couldn't be more pleased.  I am thinking about getting 3 more,  (1 of each)  just to put away for when these  finally do wear out.  You can't beat the price for this kind of quality!"
"I bought this for my granddaughter, she loves the dual colors,  it’s super soft, comfy, and has held up well on a rough 7 year old. I ended up loving this so much I ordered a second for my grandson. Great product at an amazing price!"
"I like it because it is light,warm and easy to handle."
"It's a perfect weight for those cooler summer nights, nice feel to the skin and a bit larger than expected, which is a positive."
"I needed an inexpensive comforter set for a spare bedroom.  These were priced perfectly so I didn’t expect much.  Man was I shocked!  This set is gorgeous!  I ordered a king set because I wanted extra overhang on my Queen platform bed.  The color is so pretty.  And best of all, the set washed and dried great and looks fresh crisp and new.  The fabric is lightweight with a cool silky type feel.  Not too thick so it fits in an apartment size washer.  Will definitely order from Bedsure again for all my bedding needs!"
"I love this comforter!  When I first opened it the comforter was very flat, I had to shake it a bit to fluff it up. This feels light but don’t let that fool you. It is a warm comforter. It is soft and just feels great. Beautiful looking in my room."
"This set is so soft and provides so much warmth even though the material feels so light. I love the deep emerald color."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



It’s definitely not luxurious but it works. It’s thin and lightweight. I would prefer it to be thicker and fluffier but the design makes it look nice. I washed it before use and it held well n didn’t lump up so that’s good. I wouldn’t say it’s super soft, but at least it’s not rough or scratchy feeling. I have a king size bed with a LOW box spring and the cal king size fit just right.  Over all it’s good and I’ll be keeping it as back up during washes but will be looking for something  more thicker and better quality."
"This is exactly the quality I’d expect for something like this at this price point - good. It’s super cute and the perfect weight."
"Very nice!  It's a medium weight, so not too hot.  Looks great on my bed and is very soft!"
"Full disclosure: I won’t lie. I bought this for one of my dogs. Yep. Really. For his purposes I am happy with it. Would I buy this again for a human? Absolutely not.It is soft enough but straight out of the bag it has a horrible chemical scent. That will launder out (I hope) but it’s still a turn off. The comforter is also quite thin. Now, since this is for the dog and it will be folded that will be okay. For a human, it may not be as warm as you’d like unless you are a hot sleeper.Simply put, the design is nice and I like the boho vibe, but make no mistake: this comforter and the pillow shams are cheap for a reason. If you’re looking for high quality, breathable fabric this is not it.Do I recommend it? Yes, but with a caveat… understand that you’re purchasing something that is inexpensive. If you care about fabrics and quality spend more to purchase something nice. If you just want a boho vibe on a budget, the price is right."
"This comforter is great for the price. The ivory is perfect... Not white, not yellow. It is the perfect level of warmth and coziness. I bought the queen for my full-size bed so that it comes down more on the sides."
"I am beyond impressed with the EASELAND All Season King Size Soft Quilted Down Alternative Comforter! It has exceeded all of my expectations. The softness is incredible, and the lightweight yet warm design makes it perfect for year-round use. Whether chilly or warm, this comforter keeps me comfortable without overheating. The reversible feature is a nice touch, allowing me to switch up my bedding style. Plus, it's easy to care for and holds up beautifully after washes. If you're looking for a cozy, high-quality comforter that fits any season, this is the one!"
"Absolutely AMAZING!!!  Delivers as promised. Soft, plush, warm, vibrant in color and beautiful.  Winner. I just need that Burgundy color to restock in oversized and it’s mine. I bought the charcoal gray oversized for my King size high rise bed. Perfect fit. Snooze and you will loose. Winter is coming 😂(my Game of Thrones Fans)!!!"
"I’ve been wanting to get a duvet for my bed for a while but just didn’t want to pay a lot. I found this one and the reviews were good and the price is fantastic. I washed and dried it and it held up great. It’s warm and very cozy. Very happy with this purchase"
"Not sure if it is just an aberration but the one I got is thin. This isn't to say that it isn't warm or useful but it isn't the toasty, pouffy comforter that I was looking for. I'd say that this is ideal for spring and fall. As the temperatures have dropped to the 30s and 40s at night, we've added a fleece blanket which, together with this comforter, provides enough warmth for us. (For context my husband's internal thermostat is ""normal"" (runs neither hot nor cold) while I am perimenopausal and for a time was running hot.)"
"I ordered this for our king bed and am very happy with it. It’s thinner than I expected it would be, but still very warm and snuggly! The material is super soft and the light gray is very pretty. I am very happy with this comforter and would definitely recommend and/or purchase again!"
"I like the softness and lightweight yet providing warmth."
"I love duvet and it keeps me warm during winter. I love the ease of it and the functionality of the duvet. It’s pretty soft and you are getting the value for your money."
"I'll be leaving similar reviews on the same product in different sizing: but rest assured I'm a verified buyer. I've had it better than six weeks through all kinds of crazy weather. Honestly I was not sure about this purchase: I have purchased quilts that were advertised as cotton and came to me a sticky, sweaty, stifling (and frankly disappointing) polyester. I am spoiled by the 'grandmother's sheets"" concept: crisp and cozy, all-weather breathe-ability and comfort/quality is my focus.  I have wasted so much money in search of the right sleep combination. Easeland is now my most favorite company EVER!  I am just so pleased with their product and their honest marketing (that means a lot to me). This comforter is gorgeous, cozy, extremely well-made and just plain high quality. The stitching is fine and sturdy: it's fantastic to get a quilt that I know will not bunch-up or fall apart. There were a few loose strings here and there when I opened it, but I singed those off and they were tied off/stitched down so they didn't pull and unravel: just a by-product of manufacturing process. That was no issue. The quilt expanded nicely once un-packaged. Color is a dark smokey grey which I just love (I repainted my room around the color, I loved it so much). It's not wrinkly or clumpy. I live in Michigan, where in the the summer it could be 90 during the day and in the 30's at night, and well... you know we get cold in the winter. I really wanted a quilt that had a balanced, ""comforting"" and all weather weight, but that was not ""smothering"". Easeland delivered! Hallelujah! I purchased this twin for my son and we bought the oversized queen for our new beds: they fit well and the overhang was perfect. I will say that with the new foam mattress I am glad that I did go oversized. Combined with percale Bumble sheets, the whole setup is breathable and I really love the well-stitched loops for a duvet, which I will only purchase from this same company. I returned to school to obtain a graduate degree so my teen and twenty something kids agreed to a ""Christmas in July"" as I was finishing a hard curriculum. This was a great graduation present to myself and I will be purchasing these comforters as gift for my older girls who have their own households. I know they will be a hit! It's a humid, sticky July in Michigan right now and yet this all weather quilt is perfect. And I know it will handle our Michigan winters just fine. As someone who has been struggling under the c19 shutdown with little to spend, I was worried about spending the money on another bad buy. If you're worried about the price point for Easeland: don't be. This is a very quality product and actually a fantastic brand for what you'll pay. Questions? Bring em'."
"This quilt is as soft as promised. Very well made. And the price was good.  Nice that we didn’t have to wait long to have it delivered.  I ordered two quilts and put one on top of the other, to make a soft bed for someone who has sore joints.  It is working out great.  I would recommend this quilt ."
"Nice and warm"
"Super soft material, not thick but so warm. I bought the dark grey and it beautiful!Best purchase in a while."
"Product is super warm and comfortable for the price bought 2 of them and would recommend for friends  and family to buy also"
"Very nice quality, looks very nice on the bed. It‚Äôs perfect year round. Warm enough for winter but lightweight enough for summer. Soft material and has not pilled at all. Fits our king sized bed perfect."
"So happy that I bought this comforter it‚Äôs soft. It fits my king size bed. Well, I love the color. It washes well in my washer keeps me warm even though I like to have a fan on in the winter. Very lightweight I would recommend this anyone"
"1. I love all things purple.2. I bought this because of the color.3. I am very happy with this purchase.This comforter is very lightweight and comfy. The King size comforter covers my King size bed‚Ä¶. But with little extra material. It‚Äôs lightweight and warm with what I consider a pretty shade of purple. The best part of this comforter is that I can throw it in the washer and dryer with ease."
"Seller very responsive, 1 day prime shipping service , great price and a very lovely material . Cozy and not heavy ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt washed it yet , so for this reason I don‚Äôt give it 5 star rating. No smell , perfect fit .Thinking about order up for king size next time, since I do like a bit of more covering on my queen size bed . Hubby approved as well . So far so good , get it while supplies and price last !"
"Purchased for Harley themed guest(grandkids) room in Queen. It‚Äôs a nice comforter set for the price, not too heavy but warm enough for SC winters. The fabric is nice and soft. The orange is very bright which I wanted and the black is a true black. I have not washed it yet so not sure how it will hold up in the wash yet. The bed is 23‚Äù high with mattress and box spring at 17‚Äù and the comforter just covers the frame. It works fine for this bed but you may want to size up if your bed/mattress is taller. Overall I love it , would definitely recommend"
"This is a great comforter for just about any season (except summer of course)!  Very good price (you get 2 pillow shams) and shipping was only a few days. Glad I waited for the sale,  but if you're looking for this print and color (grey),  it's a hit.  Reversible."
"..... and I love them.  I love the design, the softness, and the value for my money.  You get this warm beautiful comforter that my cat and I love, as well as 2 pillow shams and a bed skirt. I buy another everytime they go on sale. Oh, and they are reversible.  I love this so much."
"I was drawn to this comforter set because of the advertised thickness in the photos, but unfortunately, it‚Äôs not as thick as pictured. That was disappointing since it was the main reason for my purchase. However, I will say that the color is beautiful, and the softness is great, very comfortable to the touch. If thickness isn‚Äôt a priority for you, it‚Äôs a decent option."
"This item is very light and does not put undo stress on your legs or feet . This is why I purchased it . Well made and very easy to put on the bed ."
"Love this comforter. I almost never write a review but I‚Äôm pretty impressed with this comforter so why not. I read a lot of the reviews and it looked promising - glad I got it. It‚Äôs a lot warmer than I thought it was going to be given how lightweight it was out of the box. But it still feels super cozy even though it‚Äôs lighter. There were a few threads along the edges but cleaned them up by cutting them and it looks better. Washed it after a week as I have 2 dogs that are on the bed as well - it held up pretty well. Even a few blood stains from one of the dogs was washed out pretty easily with a little oxyclean pre soak. Seems to have held up to the wash well - no bleeding no clumping of the inside stuffing and no rips or tears. I put it in the dryer on a low setting. Would definitely buy again if needed."
"This comforter is lightweight and comfortable.  It’s not used as a duvet cover, it’s just a great comforter. It washes great , fits the bed perfectly and seems to be of good quality. Plus it looks cute in my pink and gray bedroom."
"Super soft and just plushy enough! This insert is warm, but breathable, so it’s perfect for people like me who sleep hot! The quality is great. I’m using it with the Bedsure stonewashed cotton duvet cover, I didn’t buy the insert a size up from the cover, but the ties make it fit perfectly regardless! The weight is just right, I love it. Definitely worth the price!!"
"I bought this insert and a cover from the same brand. The insert is on the thinner side but super comfy and it keeps me warm all night. I get cold easily haha. Great quality for the price and fit inside the cover perfectly."
"I was looking for a comforter for my bed that would make me cooler and gove more comfort because my comforter was making me sweat! Now this blanket is So Much Better! I feel much cooler, i dont have to run my air conditioner all night and Zero sweating through the night! I'm sleeping with comfort and no longer waking up throughout the night drenched!I definitely recommend this for sweaty sleepers like me! Also the price is great! For the price I was expecting something very cheap but it's not. It's decent quality. It's light weight but also would be warm enough for winter! It's performance is better than others and I really like it!"
"I am so happy I decided to order this comforter by Bedsure! Great company first of all and they sell quality products too. The comforter was vacuum sealed and when I unpacked it, it immediately puffed right up. It’s  honestly one of the best comforters I’ve ever purchased for the price! Got a really good deal during the prime sale! I ordered the green/light green color combo and it’s a sea foam but darker IRL. Nice looking and its box stitching keeps the filling in place. Seriously surprised at the quality and it’s perfect for Southern California Fall/Winter season. Very soft and yes I recommend! It can easily be used as a duvet insert too. Versatile and comfortable! Not cheap feeling at all. Fits my queen bed perfectly, completely recommend! 5 stars all the way!"
"Omgosh where do I start.We bought this new comforter when it was on sale. It's the very first brand new comforter I bought in 25 years. My mother in law used to give me some (sadly she always missed on the colour and patterns. Sorry. I never liked them, but as I hate waste, and didn't want to upset her, we used them lol)Anyway. I was excited to buy this ine lol.And wow. I love how soft it is. It's warm without being heavy, or stuffy.I bought the king size for our queen bed and it is perfect. The colour is absolutely gorgeous.I ran it through the fluff cycle in my dryer to take out the wrinkles and fluff it up before I put it in the bed and it worked like a charm it looks so good.I also washed it right away, to see if the batting would stay in place before the return window closed lol (and we wah our comforters regularily, like once a week, because yuck)It went through the wash and dry cycles beautifully.I liked it so much I tried to get ine for my son, but the sale was over and he picked one from a different company, but it turned out just as nice thank goodness. Lol"
"Love this Bedsure comforter! Light weight but so very warm & cozy, We have a split king adjustable bed so I ordered reg king xl, wish I had gotten oversized king & may just order another that size..the cyan color was pale teal & worked perfectly with our bedroom decor..can't say enough about how great this is!"
"This is a good quality duvet. This queen size duvet insert is wonderful and really light weight. I wanted a plush comforter, this duvet is plus and fluffy and when inserted in my microfiber bed sheets, it's  has helped me with my sleep pattern. I seem to get a better nights sleep, I don't wake during the night like I use to as much. This insert in my comforter feels more relaxing at night. This insert has 8 corner ties to secure and hold it in place. It is easy to wash, just wash it like any other comforter  or laundry items. This insert is wonderful in every way as far as I concerned.💕💯"
"I love purple and this comforter really looks good on my bed."
"Glad I ordered it.  Here's why:1)  It's EXACTLY as described including the color and size.  Of course, color will depend on your monitor settings, calibration and accuracy, but for mine, the color is EXACT.  I ordered the light blue which is a light steel blue.  Beautiful.  Color accuracy is not always the case with some listings.2)  VERY soft and VERY lightweight.  I've owned both Down and Alternative Down comforters for years.  This is incredibly soft and lightweight when you're snuggled under it, and it's perfect for Spring time here in California.  It will be too hot in summer when our temps get up over 100, despite AC.  It may not be warm enough for the 30-40o we get in Winter, but I think likely perfect for 6 months of the year.3)  The Fabric is SOOOOOO soft.  A pleasure to touch.4)  The size:  I wanted a BIGGER size -- but couldn't find the OVERSIZED king in this comforter, so it does not cover the entire matress on the sides, but I can turn it sideways for our Eastern King which isn't as long as a standard King and it hangs down more.  Knew this going in.  I may have to add a bed skirt as I like coverage to floor, but this won't change my mind about the comforter itself.5)  The matching Shams are a plus especially for the price.  I wish I could order more but don't see them available separately.  So coordinating ones will have to do.6)  The ONLY downside I can potentially see is wear with time.  Most alternative down comforters have closed stitching in squares or triangles in order to keep the interior fabric in place.  This doesn't.  See pic.  With use then, there is less stitching to hold the guts in place.  Time will tell.7)  Beautiful appearance.  I didn't expect it to look and feel as nice as it did.  Very pleased.8)  Would I order again -- you bet."

I recently purchased this queen bed comforter set, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way! The comforter is incredibly soft and plush, offering the perfect balance between warmth and breathability. It feels like I'm wrapped in a cloud every night, which has significantly improved my sleep quality.The design is modern and elegant, with colors that seamlessly blend into my bedroom decor. The stitching is well-done, and the material feels durable, promising to last through many washes without losing its softness or vibrant color.The set comes with matching pillows that are equally comfortable. They're fluffy and provide great support, making them perfect for lounging or adding that extra touch of coziness to the bed. I also appreciate that the set includes pillow shams, which give the bed a polished, put-together look.Overall, this comforter set has transformed my bedroom into a cozy retreat. If you're looking for both style and comfort, I highly recommend this set. It's worth every penny!"
"This is so soft and comfortable. I am very happy I bought this by accident! And it was inexpensive. Not too heavy, perfect weight and fit. A bit wrinkly right from the wash but not bad. Made well. Very Happy I did not cancel this order.Update: I noticed today, after 3 days,with some of the stitching coming undone, pulls, and tiny holes."
"This is a nicely priced, simple blanket set that is so comfy I look forward to going to bed at night. I hope your rest is as good as mine because I've enjoyed sleeping in more lately. The comforter is lightweight, but snug when wrapping up in it. Hoping it hold up well in the wash, but we'll see. The pillowcases are gentle to the skin, not rough or papery. Wasn't expecting much but very satisfied with the texture, weight, and color I chose."
"I'm happy with my purchase. The comforter is the correct size. I bought a queen size for my queen bed and it seemed plenty big to me. It's also soft and warm while staying somewhat breathable. The color looks good. The only thing that's a little annoying is it's wrinkled like crazy from being packed so tight. That will come out in time though."

"Bought this on a whim and I am so glad I did. we have a regular king bed but I bought the California king size, so we had more coverage. The blanket is soft and light but keeps me (I'm always freezing) warm and comfortable. The color(grey/blue) is really pretty, and I like the detail."
"Material and size small"
"Fabric is much softer than expected, looks great and was easy to wash / dry. Great deal for king size and quality material for the price"
"I did three hours of research to find this set and it exceeded my expectations. You really can't find equal quality at this price. I bought another set because it was so great.It comes with everything - the colors are deep and rich. I machine washed and dried both sets and they held up beautifully. The thickness of the comforter is impressive and the materials are soft and smooth. The warmth is just right and doesn't overheat.The kid I bought it for slept in two hours later than usual the first night. That alone was worth the price!"
"Perfect light weight set. Fits perfectly and the colors are bold and beautiful."
"I bought this comforter for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It is of very good quality and it fits very well on her twin bed. I do recommend that you buy it."
"A couple months ago, I decided it was time to retire our old, boring black comforter in our guest bedroom and get a new, colorful bedding set. I didn't want to spend a lot of money since the bed only gets used about once a month but I also wanted to buy a set that is cheerful and comfortable. I had previously purchased a couple of AmazonBasics items and had good luck with them so I was very happy to find this set. It had everything I needed in a pretty color for a good price so I ordered it!When the set arrived, I opened it right away to make sure it was a good quality and there weren't a lot of loose threads and poor stitching. There were just a couple loose threads but not enough to make me want to return it and find something else.This seven-piece full/queen bedding set includes:1 - colorful, patterned comforter (86 inches by 90 inches)1 - white flat sheet (90 inches by 102 inches)1 - white fitted sheet (60 inches by 80 inches by 12 inches)2 - white full/queen pillowcases (20 inches by 32 inches)2 - colorful, patterned standard pillow shams (20 inches by 26 inches)All of the pieces are made in China of 100% polyester, including the filling in the comforter. The first thing I noticed about this set is that it is incredibly soft, even before I washed it. After washing it, everything is even softer. I was easily able to wash all of the pieces in the washing machine and dry them without anything falling apart so I was very happy about that. We have a queen guest bed and the sheets fit nicely on the mattress, with a little room to spare.Our guests have said these sheets are comfortable and complimented us on the color and style of the comforter! This set adds just a bit of cheerfulness to our guest room and I'm pleased with it. The blue is not quite as bright as the picture online shows. It's more of a dusty blue, as suggested by the name of the color, but the online picture makes it seem more like a spa blue and I still like it. The white sheets are soft but thin and pretty much see-through. They don't feel like tissue paper but they aren't as thick as other sheets we've had. Still, for sheets that don't get used very often, I'm happy enough and if they get worn out, I will happily purchase a different set of sheets that match the set.Overall, I am very happy with this set and think it's a good buy for anyone looking to purchase a set for a guest room or for your own bed. It isn't the best quality but it's good for the price and seems to be holding up nicely in the two months we've had it. The sheets have been used for several nights already and have been washed a number of times. If anything happens that changes my mind or I have more information to add, I will update this review. It's a good set for the price!"
"My eighteen year old is pleased with the look, comfort & style. Iâ€™m thrilled with the price point. Iâ€™ll be buying more for my other sons."
"I've been using this set (Twin XL version) for more than a year now and just thought I'd leave a review for those still on the verge of clicking that 'Buy Now' button. To you I say: ""BUY NOW!"" If you're on this page you're probably looking for a cheap but decent-quality set that'll get you comfortable on a new bed (including those in college dorm rooms as in my case), and this set is PERFECT for that. Please note that if you're looking for super high quality linen that'll make you feel like a princess, this might not satisfy you - it spells more VALUE FOR MONEY rather than luxury.QUICK FACTS:- FIT: The fitted sheet fits perfectly on my Twin XL college dorm bed. The provided comforter is slightly wider than my needs, but wider is always better than narrower *shrugs*. I use the pillowcases with standard queen sized pillows and they fit well.- STYLE: The blue color is not too bright and not too faded in my opinion, looks pretty good on the bed. It's not super stylish though - just putting it out there.- QUALITY: The polyester keeps me warm during cold nights, and doesn't feel extremely hot during warm ones. The fabric has held up extremely well during my one year of usage (I do wash it only once every two months though), and it seems like its can go on for an year more. One more thing to note here is that the fabric is 100% polyester, which is fine for me, but if you're someone who only prefers COTTON, its NOT for you.- EASE OF USE: Finally, the quality that makes this AmazonBasics set most lucrative for college students is that its completely machine washable: just pop it into the washer/dryer on the delicates / permanent press settings and you're good! Beats expensive brands that require particular settings or dry-cleaning. Plus, the nifty bag that the set comes in proves particularly handy when you need to pack up and change dorms or move out of college housing.SUMMARY: Great for College Students, Great for those who want a Cheap but Decent-Quality product, NOT for those looking for the Absolute Best in the market. HOPE THIS HELPS, EVERYBODY! :-)"
"Love the combination of colors. Good size and soft."
"The sheets and comforter are great quality. They're comfortable and fit a hospital bed perfectly. The set looks exactly like the pictures. They fit the bed well and works well. The sheets and comforter had very few wrinkles when taken out of package."
"This bedding is lovely, and itâ€™s the second set Iâ€™ve purchased. Highly recommend. Great value."
"This is so soft!  It looks absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs warm, it‚Äôs a fantastic size for a king. Some of them seem to lack coverage but this one fits perfect. Good quality and good bang for your buck for sure! It doesn‚Äôt feel or look cheap! We are very happy with this!"
"This comforter is great, and I love the color. It's exactly what I was looking for. But the wrinkles are like nothing I've ever seen! I used a steamer (the manufacturer says not to) and it helped some. I put it on my bed, and the rest of the wrinkles have slowly come out. It's very comfortable and I love the thickness. I bought a queen size for my full size bed, and it fits perfectly. Overall, I will definitely buy again."
"Absolutely love it. Beautiful and soft and all for a great price. Lightweight yet very warm."
"More of a grey purplish color, so I'm disappointed in that, reason for 4 star's. Soft fluffed up great in the dryer on no heat setting. It looks like it's good quality and the pintucks are perfect, seams are nicely sewn, generous size and the cases are very nice but a bit long for my king size pillows, but that really doesn't interfere with the functionality. I just wish the true colors were what I was seeing. It's very soft and it should be easy to wash at the laundry mat, I have a top load washer and my bedding doesn't wash up that well. I do love it üòÄ I would recommend especially if you're looking for a grayish purple, I can't attest to the other colors. But it's more gray than purple üíú"
"Love the way it feels and looks beautiful in my bedroom, The price was wonderful. Will be purchasing again."
"I rarely write reviews but I wanted to comment on this comforter to respond to other reviews about it coming all wrinkled. It does come in a vacuum package and when I took it out, I put it in the dryer for about ten minutes to fluff it out. I bought the dark green one and it is a beautiful dark green. I read a review where someone ironed their quilt to get the wrinkles out. I am not very skilled with an iron for something like that but I have a handheld steamer that I put a long extension cord on and steamed it and the pillow cases right on the bed. It came out very nice.  The quilt is so soft and comfy too. It took some work but it was worth it. I am very pleased with this purchase."
"It is the perfect comforter!! I absolutely love it!! It is so cozy and comfortable!! It‚Äôs light weight and very soft! It‚Äôs so cute and goes with all of my bedroom decor! Great quality and even better price!"
"Definitely doesn‚Äôt look like the picture, poor quality, very light weight, good for summer but I would not recommend. Gave 3 stars for softness and light weight."
"Made in Canada! I put it in the dryer on fluff cycle and puffed right up from packaging.  Soft and very comfortable.Warm and cozy.  Color is as pictured."
"This comforter set is very nice and soft! Not heavy, just perfect for cold season, very well made it ! Good price and fast shipping too ! Thanks !"
"This comforter is super lightweight, soft, and comfortable. Great value for the money and I adore the pattern!"
"I ordered the King size set and it is beautiful. I’m obsessed. It’s so soft and comfortable; not thin and cheap. Great quality. This may be a bit warm for summer but honestly it wasn’t so bad since I always run the air conditioning. This will be perfect for winter. The colors are gorgeous. This set was better than I expected. I highly recommend."
"Very lightweight but still enough so you won’t be cold. Good for those who live in hot states looking for one, coming from a Texas girl. Our winter comforter was expensive so I wasn’t looking forward to spending a lot of money on a lightweight one for the summer heat. This gets the job done, looks so good, and feels soft. Good value for the cost. Fits our queen bed perfectly without being too long or too short. The quality serves its purpose for the price. So far is holding up well against our crazy kitten! Bonus that it comes with two shams because I have to have matching decor pillows."
"Absolutely love this new comforter. It's soft and great quality for the price. It doesn't get too hot and my partner heats up a ton at night but I still feel cool under this. I do wish it had slightly more fill to it as it seems kind of flat but really isn't a big deal to me, the colors are beautiful and I will definitely purchase from this brand again."
"I purchased the Coconut White, in the Queen size. I wanted it for the winter, to brighten up the bleak and cold season. It fits well and so soft. I haven’t experienced getting it stained yet, but I’m sure it will be stain resistant. I also like the fact it is reversible. The colors are vibrant, in the flowers in the pattern and the reverse side is strips. It doesn’t emit any odors and I must reiterate, it’s soft and cozy! I did purchase another comforter, in Infinity Blue. It is on my bed now and it looks great!"
"I love it! Its soft and beautiful.  Has enough overhang on each side of the bed. King version. Love the color and pattern. Is warm and cool at the same time."
"I have had a great experience with this brand for the most part. All bedding comes just as pictured with really pretty colors. BUT the only thing I don't like about this comforter is that it feels like a polyester material and it traps heat so we wake up verrrry sweaty. It does look great on the bed! We may look for a different material one in the future from this brand."
"Looks nice and for winter or autumn, comfortable, decent quality for the price,"
"This lightweight comforter looks expensive and feels great. I am pleased with the quality. It is just a touch warmer than I was expecting, but should work great in the cooler months. It's still very lightweight, and may be perfect for most people."
"We live this comforter. It is light and fluffy yet retains warmth when the house drops in temperature to( 63) degrees. Not a fan of heaviness on my feet when sleeping and this is perfect."
"This is advertised as keeping you cool, and it's better than some comforters, but still too warm for me. The quality is good, stitching is good, sizing is correct and the colors don't run in the wash."
"It's my current favorite blanket. The fabric is smooth and comfortable and none of the stitches have come out. It's not super heavy or thick. I personally run warm and this has never gotten too warm for me, but still keeps out the cold. I've been layering it with another blanket as the weather gets colder."
"I love these comforters. I have a white one and I just ordered the black one. Someone suggested to size up, I went with a King for my Queen size mattress and LOVE the extra size. It covers my whole mattress perfectly. This is not too heavy and the fabric is very soft. They are super easy to clean as well!"
"Bought a duvet cover and it worked great inside, very fluffy but also easy to make the bed too."
"Stitching started coming undone within the first month of using it. However, it is comfortable and lightweight!"
"I was in need of a new comforter, and this one was on sale for a great price, so I decided to go with it after reading many positive reviews. A big issue I was having with my last comforter, was it constantly bunching up in one area of the blanket, and after a while, it just stayed stuck like that. The comforter essentially became useless aside from having the bare minimum covering you. That was a huge factor in what I was looking for in a new one. I am also a hot sleeper - was looking for something lightweight, but still comfortable, as well. So far, I am loving this one. It is lightweight, snug and comfortable. The square patching will prevent the inside from bunching up, which is crucial. I am not overheating in it either, which is great. It is cooler fall temps now where I am in Canada - but I imagine this will still be ideal for me come winter. Can’t say for summer temps at this point. This would work on its own without a duvet cover just fine, but I did purchase one anyway for aesthetics. I highly recommend it!"
"This queen comforter is exactly what I was looking for. Stylish, lightweight, and extremely comfortable ~ it's very soft."
"I bought this for my Dad and he really loves it"
"It's a good size and the color is on point. The material is life a sleeping bag, very light but still keeps you warm."
"This is a lightweight comforter that my husband is loving! The soft grey color is not overpowering. The queen size fits perfectly. The quality is nice was well."
"Arrived on time and actually much bigger than i anticipated! Its soft and not to heavy and not to light. I love it."
"This comforter is fairly thin, it is soft. It would be perfect for a dorm room or teenager. I would not recommend for an adult room. The quality is not the greatest"
"I am very pleased with the quality of this comforter!"
"Recipient loved it!!!"
"Nice sizing for a king size, I usually find that when I buy a comforter, it’s a little short on the sides because I have a high mattress, but this one seems to fit just right, It is also very soft and And looks like it will be easy to clean. Also, it’s not too thick or too thin. It’s just right , very happy with my purchase."
"Enjoying the light weight yet warm. Love the colour and material"
"This comforter is great, it's lightweight but not paper thin.  Way softer than I expected too.  I washed and dried it on normal and it was just fine.  I'm pleased with this purchase."
"I absolutely love these frames. They look nice and are easy to style. I love that it’s not real glass and they won’t break (I move a lot and have gone thru so many frames). Easy to clean and easy to switch out photos. Highly recommend!"
"Got this for my new place! The quality is great! Worth the money. Easy to use! Size as desired! Definitely recommend for my friends!!"
"Love the frames and they were exactly as described. I hated the protective film that is on the front and back of each frame's plexiglass.  It was hard to peel off and some didn't come off at all, I had to use a razor and peel up a corner to get it going. Other than that, perfect frames for our remodel"
"TheseThese frames do the job perfectly! They’re super easy to assemble and use plexiglass, which is ideal if you have kids (like I do). They arrived without any damage, thanks to the great packaging. Just be sure to remove the protective plastic film from both sides of the plexiglass before using. The images fit perfectly, and they look fantastic! I’d definitely buy them again—totally worth it!"
"Good quality for the price, they look very nice on my wall.  I have OCD and needed a matching set so this was perfect.  I kind of like that the front is plastic, less of a chance my kids break them (if they fall)"
"These frames are great. The quality and value for the price is very good. I am very happy with this purchase and plan to purchase another set in the near future."
"They frames themselves look nicer than they actually are; I guess for the price it might be worth it; 4 of 5 stars.My biggest complaint is the ""nails"" that come with it; they don't ""push in"" to the hanger and because of that most of them can't even stick to the wall -- not sure the purpose of including these... might as well have left them out completely; minus 1 star for this flaw."
"My mom passed away. I have few photos to remember her. These frames worked out amazingly.  Thank you so much. Better than the rest"
"Hesitant to order these, but pleasantly surprised that they were so nice.  Well-made plastic frames, easy install of photos from rear with with nice locking devices.  Even clear glass (not plastic) ends up with a quality result.  Would definitely order again."
"The gold frames look like they cost much much more than they did. The method of closing the photo into the frame is unique and usually used by products that are much more expensive.  Frames look very very nice on the wall in a grouping. Can also stand up alone on a table which is very nice. Sand is very strong.  Attractive and expensive looking hooks for hanging frames on the wall are also included.  I will be purchasing more of these gold frames.  They also come in additional colors.  A very very good buy."

"They look very nice and do not look like cheap frames, sturdy frames, worth buying!"
"Nicely built, great quality given the price, very well packaged against damage. A real value!"
"I thought these frames were really cute. They were nice and bold and went along with my current set up on accent wall. I was a bit disappointed cause one of the frame glasses was broken. Otherwise it was a good purchase- I would still recommend :)"
"I used these for my grandchildrens graduation photos, 10 of them."
"Great frames, good quality and sizes. Looks great on the wall for the collage look we were going for. The difference in sizes and portrait and landscape hanging is great.  I'd recommend for anyone looking to create this look on a wall, even in a smaller space"
"Because of the price I was expecting something cheap, I was ok with that as long as they looked ok from far away. But dang I was surprised. Light weight, sturdy, no cracks or paint discoloration. Every color was perfect.  The plastic that covers the picture is as clear as glass. Film was easy to take off just roll from the corner. I wasnâ€™t sure of the round pieces that came with it but apparently they replace nails for hanging. Seems to work pretty well so far. No complaints at all, Iâ€™m actually ordering another set right now. You definitely wonâ€™t regret it."
"These are super lightweight and easy to hang and they look so nice on the wall! My only complaint is the plastic cover in the front which makes a weird glare from the sides different than regular glass would. It bends a little and makes the picture look a little strange but for the price, theyâ€™re really good"
"These are not expensive frames. They are made of cheap wood and covered with paper for the ""wood grain"" effect.The 8x10s come with plastic instead of glass.However, inspite of those things, they look amazing! My review picture is the 8x10 with the plastic and you can't tell it isn't glass.Aside from a little minor touch up on the corners of the black frames, and a piece of glass that broke while cleaning (I had a spare broken frame, so I could easily use that piece of glass), these pictures frames are worth it.So, unless you are wanting very expensive frames and the potential troubles that may not exist don't buy these.But if you are willing to use a little permanent marker, if necessary, they are great frames and worth the money."
"I wanted an assortment of frames to make a gallery wall these are perfect. A good variety of color, size and orientation."
"Given to our daughter as a birthday gift and she hasnâ€™t stole my phone since she got this! She loved taking photos on my phone and is now obsessed with her own camera that prints! And itâ€™s so cheap to refill the paper"
"I love them, the plexy glass is fabulous. Easy to hang up very pretty"
"I honestly donâ€™t know why I expected much more considering the price point but many reviews made me optimistic. They look very cheap. If you hang them where people canâ€™t get to close they might work fine but even from a couple feet away you can tell they are very cheaply made. They do not look like real rustic wood at all. They appear to look covered in a wood printed sticker or something. Returning."
"This frame is so cool! Perfect size and color. I use it for my puppy’s pictures by the house entrance. Good quality and easy to move around. Good price!"
"Needed a specific size and this worked great!"
"Bought a couple to gift pictures from our wedding to family and everyone loved their gifts. The frame is nice quality and a great value."
"I really like the 4x6 collage frame. Works great in my office."
"So clearly I did not read the full description for the sizing of this frame, based on the first picture I assumed it was slightly smaller, but I was pleasantly surprised as to how big it was, its actually really GORGEOUS! I’m glad I picked it but may have to rethink where to put it because the initial shelf I had in mind for it is a tad too small, but that’s not a complaint. This modern, chic frame goes perfect with the gold accents I have in my living space. I’ll update this review once I fill it with photos and find the best spot for it, but in the meantime don’t think twice, it’s a winner!"
"I purchased as a gift for my fiancé. I was able to easily place the photos inside! It is a nice quality and versatile frame!"
"I love this frame for my office. Its cute and just what i needed. I plan on swapping my picturea out every few months."
"My friend returned from a vacation and her birthday was coming up so I printed some of her vacation pictures and put them in this frame. It looked beautiful and she loved it!"
"Mine came in perfect condition, perfect for 4 photos. It’s sturdy and easy to add photos! Very happy with my purchase."
"I bought this as a gift and put family photos in it. It was very well received. Huge smiles."
"I was looking for a frame to hold multiple pictures. This frame is exactly as described."
"One of the reasons I bought this was because it holds both horizontal and vertical pictures."
"Good quality.  Fit the pictures size well, looks great.  Glass was think and seemed to be picture protection great worth the price i couldn't even find any at stores like this or cute"
"The frames looks beautiful on the desk. Quality is amazing, its the perfect Gold."
"I really love the look of these gold frames.  My daughter’s ballet pictures look great in them."
"Nice stand-up double frame.  Suits the images of our twin grandsons perfectly.  We found the little metal tabs that hold the pictures in a bit hard to handle as we have relatively poor eyesight for tiny things."
"Good value for the money. Arrived in good packaging and in good shape"
"We, sadly, had to put down our old dog. I wanted a simple way to be able to see her face to remember her so I got this frame (plus three more for our other dogs) and they were the perfect size for their pictures and little paw prints 💖"
"One of the problems with these hinged picture frames is that the hinges tend to be flimsy.  I was buying this product to replace another frame with bent and loose hinges.  The hinges on this frame seem sturdier."
"It was picture frame it did it’s prepose / cheaply made"
"Good, really inexpensive. Frame colors were perfect for my project. I don't think it's real wood & plexiglass is used instead of real glass. But I like them, good value."
"Beautiful & go great on my well. I love the mix of colors."
"These look great, the colors and tones were as pictured and described. Two of them were broken or coming apart at the corners, where it‚Äôs basically stapled together. It‚Äôs not real wood. A little super glue worked fine, and I was able to hang them ok. They looked great, and for the price are what I‚Äôd expect."
"I didn't realize when ordering these that they had plastic instead of glass, however it was a pleasant surprise.  If they are knocked over, they will not have shattered glass everywhere.  I have them for my office for my diplomas and certificates.  The different colored frames make for a great match to nearly any decor."
"Good quality and price!"
"So these are very pretty - and they are great for hanging on the wall. A couple of things - one is that this is not glass - and the plastic comes with film on it that you have to peel off, which takes a while, so make sure you have patience to do that (and finger nails!!!). Also, the stands in the back aren't really long enough, so if you're trying to set this on something instead of hanging it on a wall, the picture frame tips waaaaay waaaay back and looks kind of stupid. So, if you have patience and just want to hang these on the wall, they're great. Otherwise, maybe look for something else."
"Exactly what I was looking for"
"Good quality"
"Nothing fancy. Good enough to put on a wall"
"I absolutely love these picture frames! They’re the perfect blend of simplicity and elegance, making them an ideal addition to any room in my home. I’ve used them to display cherished family photos, and they truly enhance the overall aesthetic of the pictures.What I Appreciate:Sleek Design: The clean, white frame with a smooth finish complements any style of decor, whether modern or traditional. It has a timeless look that doesn’t distract from the photo itself but instead enhances it.High-Quality Materials: The frames feel sturdy and well-made. The glass is crystal clear, protecting the photos beautifully without any distortion or glare.Versatile Display Options: I love that these frames come with both an easel back for tabletop display and hooks for wall mounting. It gave me the flexibility to mix and match how I wanted to display my photos in different spaces.Perfect Size: The size is ideal for standard 4x6 or 5x7 photos, making it easy to swap pictures without needing custom prints.A Small Suggestion:The back stand can be a little snug when you’re first setting up the frame, but once it’s in place, it’s very secure. It’s not a major issue, but something to be mindful of if you’re handling fragile prints.Overall, these frames are an excellent choice for showcasing your favorite memories. They’re stylish, affordable, and versatile. Whether you’re displaying family portraits, travel photos, or art prints, these frames are sure to add a touch of class to any space. Highly recommend—five stars!"
"I bought this frame to put My baby paw print that passed away last month. So here is my review. It looks decent and sturdy and holds up well on the wall,so what more could I ask for. The only con is that the pexi glass is super paper thin, and feels fragile. Also peeling the plastic on it its a huge pain. Wish the glass was more thicker. Now the second frame I got it came with some scratches and small tear and wear. Other than that it is a good inexpensive picture frame that does the job."
"I was looking for a small frame with plexiglass instead of real glass.  This 2-pack fit the bill perfectly.  Nothing fancy here, but these are nice for a cost-effective way to frame a favorite 5x7 photo for self or to gift.  And the plexiglass makes them break-resistant, which was important for me as this was going to a relative in a dementia care unit where the frame could easily be mishandled.  So if you are looking for a no-frills, but nice looking and ""safe"" framing option, I would certainly recommend these."
"These are great frames . Light weight yet sturdy. Priced right . Will order more ."
"I kept the frames because it was too much of a hassle to return, but I will never buy them again. Although they look fantastic, they are not very strong. They do not sit correctly on the table because there’s a strap in the back that is a little to tight so the frames can’t widen the way they should to be able to be stable on the table.  It’s still a nice looking frame though, but I think the quality is very cheap. But …..you can’t ask for much for that little Price."
"The frames were perfect.  'Thanks."
"These picture frames work well, but the quality is not super great. They do not feel super durable, but they are working for what I needed them for."
"This set is as light as a frame can get! I could not go to the dollar store so I got these for x2 picture I needed to frame.As most modern frames no glass but plastic. Better as there is no risk of injury or shatter. For everyday pic it is a good deal."
"Good frame. I left the pictures in and people think I have a good looking family."
"Nice plain frame with virtually unbreakable ""glass"" in front. Frame itself is plastic, if that matters to you. Nicely finished. This pkg is a set of 2."
"The frames are a bit flimsy and its not glass, its like fiberglass or something. Once pictures are in it looks fine and you cant tell but the flip stands that hold the fram up are also very cheap the frames tip over easily."
"This was surprisingly larger than i expected, which i loved so I included a picture with sunglasses in front to reference size. It‚Äôs very bright and good quality, which you can dim, and its touch screen! You can rotate videos and pictures. It‚Äôs easy to set up/use! It has a lot of modifications so that‚Äôs good. The screen has the weather, time, and date the picture or video showing date included."
"I have purchased 3 more of these for Christmas gifts. Very easy to set up and such a sweet gift to give someone. Memories to look back on and retell a story from that moment you captured."
"I ordered one of these and loved it so much that I ordered 5 more for family Christmas gifts.  The price is perfect.  I am currently scanning old family pics and plan to load se of the to each frame to personalize the gift.  I know my sisters, nephew, and daughters will love this gift.  I am thinking about ordering one for my grandson for his apartment and loading it with his car pics.  Family pics wouldn't do anything for him.  If it's not a car, he doesn't want to look at it.  Lol"
"Love that I can add and delete pics in a pinch and that friends and families can do the same via a link.  Super easy to use.  Love Love Love IT!"
"It works well. It was easy to set up & use. These are great to give out as gifts. Highly recommended"
"Love this product ! Super easy to use ."
"Love my Beautiful picture frame. It uploads very quickly and easy to upload photos."
"This is my first device like this. It has all the basic functions you would expect. Easy to use app to upload. Videos buffer slightly that is the only real issue."
"Good value but as a purist the angle of view is a little restrictive so strategically position to view.  Didn't come with appropriate power plug but did have appropriate voltage transformer.  Amazon nor seller warned nor had algorithm to warn or upsell an adapter.  Delayed setting up.  Somewhat disappointing. ** EDIT: supplier has reached out, apologetic and have since sent out an appropriate adapter. ** The App' is a little clumsy but on the right path.  All up good value but expect not the smoothest learning curve.  I will buy a second to have a portrait and landscape choice.  The frame's software has nice feature where full frame or cropped images. I can recommend based on value."
"Had to return as product never turned on."
"Didn’t know what to expect for the price. The frame design was really nice, not actually whitewashed wood, which I didn’t expect for the price, but it is very pretty and I was pleasantly surprised. Good quality. Perfect for what I needed."
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like these or not, turns out they're very nice. It is a very bright frame to better draw attention to the photo. I like how it was packaged because there was a cover on both sides of the glass. My 8x10 photo fit perfectly in there and it looks wonderful."
"Frames cute, sturdy but with plexiglass. Rare 4x4 size. Only complaint is the (sturdy) cardboard stand is short ie so frame doesn’t stand as upright as usual. But frame would hang and also props on a little easel-type stand just fine (and I can probably extend the cardboard stand if needed). Well packagesd, great instructions. Overall, just fine for the very low price for set of two."
"Broke easily and the frame wasn’t correct size for the glass.  The glass moved easily and it broke easyThe manufacturer were unbelievably wonderful.  Got return my money and didn’t need to send it backExcellent customer serviceI think I had a bad egg.  I would try them again so they worth 5 stars"
"Ordered these frames as part of a gift, not sure what to expect in terms of quality.  They arrived quickly, they were easy prep for the card I was framing, and once finished, they looked great.  I recently saw the cards I framed and gave as gifts hanging on the way of my friends home and they both looked perfect.  Excellent price, good quality, fast service.  I would order these again for sure.  ** Note, there is not glass as part of the frame, it's heavy, clear plexiglass type material.  However, hanging on the wall, you could not tell the difference at all."
"These shipped extremely quick and arrived as expected. Even though the clear protection is only plastic, you can't tell unless you go up really close. It wasn't a negative factor to me as it made the frames lighter and easier to hang up.The white paint was just a wee thin and dark for me - it was more gray. But that wasn't too big a deal as the distressed is supposed to be natural and have thar randomized color effect.Overall, really easy to set up with my pictures and just really uniform and beautiful. LOVE the mats and the width they used because it didn't cut into integral parts of my pictures like other matting does.Great frames! Highly recommend!!!"
"Cheap frame, you’re getting what you paid for, plexiglass is thin/flexible. Is NOT for table top use, wall mount only, does not have stand only hooks for hanging."
"At first I wasn't sure what to think about plastic rather than glass on the front, but that made these frames ideal for shipping cross country, and I even used the same, well-designed cardboard box they came it.Also the frames are a nice faux-weathered finish."
"The product was not very sturdy and was not what I thought, but the cost reflected the product. my won mistake."
"This is a sturdy frame and very attractive."
"Nice wood frame, sturdy and value for the money."
"I have ordered at least 8 of these frames. They are well-made. I like the choice of colors. However, at least two of them came with glass broken. They were package in plastic bags and not boxes, although I requested boxes. Amazon was quick to replace the frames, though."
"Thought it would be faded or not put together well. Exceeded my expectations as it is a very beautiful piece"
"No complaints with this frame! Sometimes distressed products can look cheap or like they have been worn through use versus looking the part. This still looks like a never before used frame with the distressed accents. Easy to remove backing and place picture in. The stand is sturdy and doesnt allow the frame to lean back too far"
"I mean it's a frame, that you put a photo in. It worked!"
"Just received the Lawrence White Wash Maple Frame.  It is absolutely beautiful!  I just added matting and am using it to frame engagement photos for a bridal shower gift."
"Bought one of these for a desktop position. The arm that holds the picture up right was so flimsy the picture ended up pointing more to the ceiling then at you. Returned it and bought another one thinking it might just be a bad batch.The second one had the same problem plus there were marks along one side of the frame. Looked like it wasn't stained properly.Not worth the money. Very poor quality."
"these picture frames are amazing!! the plexiglass is perfect keeps me from having to worry about them falling and breaking with our dog running around. they don‚Äôt feel cheap at all either so totally worth the price! they are super easy to hang and made my dream of how i wanted my wedding pictures hung perfect!"
"I needed an inexpensive, but ‚Äúgreat looking‚Äù way update, and display, various family photos, with a common ‚Äútheme‚Äù. (I didn‚Äôt want the look of mismatched photo frames.)These ‚ÄúHappyHapi 5x7 Picture Frames, 18 Pack Photo Frame‚Äù set got the job done!The wood frames came well packed, with each frame individually wrapped. The frames are well made ‚Äì meeting at a true 90 degrees, in each corner. Nice!Overall, the ‚Äú5x7 Picture Frames, 18 Pack‚Äù is an easy, great looking, cost-effective way, to display the photos that matter the most to you!Recommended!"
"These are pretty good quality for the price. They are not the most durable frames in the world, but way better than the dollar tree. I think the quality for the price is well worth it. Note it is plastic and not glass."
"Quality frame, easy to hang up, I like the plastic instead of glass."
"These frames are durable feeling, the cover isn‚Äôt glass which is helpful in a house full of boys. They look nice and come with awesome Wall hooks for hanging.My frames don‚Äôt fit flush against the wall when using the wall hooks provided but, they still look great and are secure."
"Great photo frames and super sturdy. Fits photos as expected and can be matted or not depending on preference. Thick plastic material used for this instead of glass, but still clear picture. Definitely a good value for the price."
"Wrapped well, none were broken. Decent quality, film on both sides to protect the glass. Used for family photos for parents in childcare center and they were very pleased! So convenient to buy in bulk! Was a lightning deals so very happy!"
"These frames worked for what I needed them for. Unfortunately I didn't read the fine print and was not aware that they aren't glass.... It's plexiglass. Not my favorite and probably wouldn't have ordered if I read that part. Pretty cheap material, but you get what you pay for. Probably would've returned if I didn't live in such a remote place with long wait times for packages. Otherwise, they get the job done."
"I'm very impressed with this frame. I bought this frame for our church to put a photo in. I was surprised at the quality and the weight of the frame. Definitely not cheap and lightweight! Will buy more from my own house. I love that it has a beautiful vintage look to it as well"
"The frames are beautiful, perfect for my daughter‚Äôs graduation pic üôåüèΩ frames are sturdy and nicely made. Great deal"
"Definitely looks more expensive than it is, love the rich gold color as well!"
"Bought these for three The New Yorker cover art prints. The combination of the art's colors and style with the frame's true, rich gold tone, design and width of frame is perfectly stunning. Overall great quality and price. I'm very happy with this product and will highly recommend to anyone."
"This frame is beautiful. Never mind the fact that it's plastic. It is well made, very sturdy, and the finish is really nice. It looks like an expensive frame. It also has a glass pane."
"CON: The supplied wall hanging feature was totally useless!PRO: The wood frame is not only good-looking, but allowed me to manually attach eye screws and picture hanging wire to achieve the finished look!"
"I am not typically a fan of gold frames but I needed to buy one to match a gift I purchased. I looked at several frames and read many reviews. After much time and consideration, I chose this frame. I am very happy with my choice. The frame is well built, it is high quality. It was packaged well and the gift looks absolutely perfect inside this frame. No other frame would have worked. If you are looking for a gold frame that is high quality and not some cheap piece of garbage, I highly recommend purchasing this product. And the delivery was really fast. Even with Amazon prime, there seems to be a delay in many products being delivered. That was not the case here. It came faster than I expected."
"Awesome frame, thick and well constructed. Can be hung vertical or horizontal and placed on table."
"Got this on sale I think but the quality is very high for a good price, it looks really elegant and well built. It elevated the piece that I put into the frame by a lot and is a rich gold colour. Great find"
"Great frame . Just what I needed"
"This is a royal product. One of a kind frame with gold borders. Easy to open install the pic and close it back."
"I recently received the MAYJAM Tea Tree 20 Pcs Pure Essential Oil Gift Set, and I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and versatility of this product.**Variety:**This gift set includes 20 different essential oils, each with its own unique properties and benefits.

They are 100% pure, without any additives or fillers, which is evident in their potent aroma and efficacy.

Each oil is securely stored in a sturdy box, with individual slots to prevent spillage and mixing. The amber glass bottles protect the oils from UV light, ensuring their longevity.**Usage:**These oils have multiple uses.

"Like these for scent and the kit comes with small droppers to apply as many drops as you wish. The small bottles do not come as eye dropper. They have a small stopper in the bottle to remove when needing oil, but it ensures no leakage. Like the scents and the variety. Inside the container nicely done shows different drops for different reasons."
"These are the best and most potent oils besides Doterra! I wish they came in bigger sizes for the set because I run through them within a month, but I truly love mixing to find different scent moods every day. Take care!"
"This MayJam 20 piece essentials oil set is very good for the price. It includes all the popular scents and more. It comes in a box that's easy to open from the side. The glass bottles are small in size but a little goes a long way. Each scent has a stopper inside and then the cap. I reordered the scents in alphabetical order to find the ones I'm looking for easier. So far, I've used a few of the combinations listed on the inside cover (Refresh the Air, Refresh Spirit, Focus, and Sunday Vibes) in an electric oil diffuser that I also purchased from Amazon. Sometimes I adjust the drops down a bit so the scent isn't too strong or overpowering.I try to keep the set stored upright because I've noticed some minor leakage from a few of the bottles when it's left laying flat even when it's capped tightly.Overall, I would recommend."
"I received the product very quickly and was package extremely well.  No leakage from any bottle. It's a very large selection. The scents are so delicate and transfer into my DIY lip and body products nicely.  The scents are perfect and original of each choice.  I love these and will be ordering again when needed."

I like this product because you get such a big variety of oil options and I love the different recipes. It‚Äôs fun because with the droppers it feels like it‚Äôs making a potion.I only did 3 stars because they are super hard to open. I‚Äôve broken one jar already trying to open it. The lids get covered in oil because of how they lay down. The dropper can make it almost worse and harder to use.There‚Äôs multiple I literally can‚Äôt even open anymore. For the price it‚Äôs fine but probably wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
"You have a great selection to choose from and it works well in any diffuser"
"Yes absolutely luv it best thing ever, üòç they smell so good I've only tried a few but already want to get a bigger one of them. Luv the packaging very neat and orderly"
"I have purchased several different oils from this company and I have to give a shout out to them. First of all, the oil comes safely packed into a nice box that is sealed with an outer wrapping. When you open the box, the glass dropper is secured in a foam package to prevent breakage and the bottle itself is also secured in tight-fitting cardboard. All products I ordered smell amazing and you get a large volume of oil (almost 4 oz) for the same price as many other products that only give you 0.5oz of oil! I love the dropper instead of the small bottles of oil that in many cases I have tried to add a specific amount of drops and those little plastic stoppers don't always allow the oil to come out one drop at a time. This dropper allows you to use exactly the amount you want, whether that is 3 drops or 1 ml at a time. Love the product and plan to buy more!"
"The Japanese Magnolia is an absolutely amazing scent, but it's normally 8.99, not 9.99Yalls black friday and cyber deal for 8.49 is a little saving but not a whole dollar fifty... lol.I'm still going to buy this again because I love the smell tho. Just not today! :)"
"This vanilla smells wonderful.  I have started using it on several things I do like soap and creams.  I highly recommend it.  A wonderful amount for the money. Smells amazing."
"The oil smells nice but when I put in a cold air diffuser it had a mild throw.After a few hours smell died outGood price but again throw needs to last longer"
"I got the grape scent. I’ve been particularly obsessed with Grape juice/wine scents for a while now and was hopeful even after seeing reviews that said it smelled more like candy than actual grapes. But they were definitely telling the truth; it honestly smells like a cotton candy brand that had a limited edition grape flavor. It smells okay but definitely isn’t that soothing natural grape scent. I’ve been using it as a body oil. At first it has a chemical hint to it after putting it on, but I expected that since it’s a concentrate primarily used for air fresheners. I’m glad to say that the first thing to fade is said chemical scent, and that after that it gets a lot closer to a grape scent. I’d say in order, these are the scents I noticed: 1. Artificial grape with chemical undertones. 2. lazily made special grape edition of some candy that was not properly perfected. 3. grape jolly rancher. 4. I’m a particularly sweaty person and after a bit of a day id say the musk scent combines decently, where it luckily doesn’t smell like someone tried to hide a sweaty armpit by covering it in roses. All in all, i think im gonna look for a different kind just because it wasn’t what i was looking for, but if you just want the general concept of grape it will work well."
"Scent is good for lotions and soap. It has gardenia undertones with a hint of powder. Good for diys like  soap, lotions etc. if you’re looking for a lavender like scent that isn’t camphourous or pine like this will do."
"I use it in place of dryer sheets smell lasts a long time and isn’t irritating to my skin like fabric softener and dryer sheets"
"Kinda smells like mango and peach together.  Smells so good."
"Exactly what it says it is and smells divine. I used it in soap making"
"Really nice scent with wax melts works great"
"Really like this oil amazing scent"
"I bought this lavender essential oil because I haven’t ever bought the lavender. Great aroma from the oil lavender just cascading through the air extremely great price for the size of a bottle that I got just a little couple drops on my hands bone couple in the tub for my wife she loves it. Recommend this to everyone extremely affordable perfect size."
"I have been bitten twice by a brown recluse spider.  The first time I didn’t have this basil oil and tried to use oregano oil instead.  It didn’t work and skin started to turn .. so I used lavender oil to stop any further deterioration.  It WORKED!  Lavender oil actually stops the damage.  Went to my doctor on the following Monday, and she told me “whatever you’re doing it worked.. it definitely was a bite”.The second time I was bitten I did have basil oil, used it and it worked great!! I didn’t even need to go to the doctor to get it checked out!I found out spraying the house with peppermint oil sin water will keep spiders out of your house/storage area."
"This rose essential oil is incredibly concentrated—just one drop fills the room with a beautiful fragrance that lasts for days. After diluting it with water, the mixture can still be used for cleaning, like mopping the floor or refreshing the toilet, leaving the whole house smelling amazing. I bought it during Black Friday, and the price was unbelievably affordable. Highly recommend for anyone who loves natural, long-lasting scents!"
"Smells great and is easy to use with the dropper. Bought it to deter bugs, it doesnt seem to do that very well though. Every time I use the bottle, oil manages to get on the outside of it and can make a little bit of a mess. But other than that, I love the product"
"If your not sure which company to purchase high quality, organic Argan Oil from.. Read On! Honestly, there's many companies that offer high quality Moroccan Argan Oil, the first two that come to mind are Leven Rose and Kate Blanc. My girlfriend and I use Argan Oil from the aforementioned companies (we use many of the same body/skin/hair oils from various companies as each have different properties and factors involved) I ordered Majestic Purer Moroccan Oil in early August and the bottle arrived without the glass dropper. No problem.. This company, like others, though actually more so, stands by it's product and the customer support is nothing short of outstanding! I contacted Majestic Pure via e-mail here in the Amazon site and explained the problem. A new bottle was immediately sent out. Meanwhile, my girlfriend and I began applying the oil very carefully by pouring it slowly out of the bottle over the bathroom sink. I had never used Argan Oil before trying this company's product. I immediately noticed it's very thick and ""rich"" and absorbs very quickly. Not much of a scent, just the basic light odor that's accompanies all Argan Oil. A few days after trying this oil, being an Amazon Prime member, the replacement bottle arrived with the glass dropper securely packaged with the bottle of oil. Meanwhile, I also ordered Argan Oil from Kate Blanc and Teddie Organics. Leven Rose's Argan Oil just arrived and it hasn't been opened yet. As noted above, this oil is thick and rich and, in my opinion is the very best Argan Oil on the market today! It's 100% pure Moroccan Argan Oil.. Organic, cold pressed, unrefined and totally natural oil. Again, we rotate a few of the same oils in our nightly application from various companies (Jojoba, Argan and Coconut being a few we double up on) This Argan Oil is of superb quality and in my opinion it doesn't get any better than this, being so pure and natural.. The oil itself is basically clear, with a slight yellowish tint you'll see in the dropper when you apply it. To conserve this ""liquid gold"" as it's been called, we rotate it with Kate Blanc, Teddie Organics and we'll be adding Leven Rose's Argan Oil to our inventory of this particular oil within a few days. The oils from these companies are extreme high quality in themselves, yet we find Majestic Pure's Argan Oil to be the very finest in quality, definitely the best Argan Oil we've tried so far. We apply many oils to each other after our nightly warm bath and cool shower. What Fun! These oils include Jojoba, Argan, Coconut, Leven Rose Vitamin E Serum, VERB Ghost Oil and VERB Leave In Mist, Hairfluence Growth And Shine, Fur Oil, Toji Essentials Argan Hair Growth Oil Treatment (Amazing In Itself!) Darshana Natural Indian Hair Oil, Amaki Certified Organic Essential Oils (Five Organic Oils in One And More!)  Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil, and Leven Rose's Rosehip Night Serum. We just added Pumpkin Seed Oil & Carrot Seed Oil, they just arrived and we haven't added  them yet to our nightly routine. A few of these oils we use rather liberally, those being Jojoba, Argan and Coconut Oil as we apply these oils everywhere (I mean everywhere!) and the rest of the above oils we use very sparingly. The combination of these oils, for me, has thickened my body and pubic hair (already thick, I decided I wanted even thicker chest and pubic hair) and these oils in particular are doing the job, as I'm seeing results after just four to five weeks. Also, my skin is softer, more healthy and radiant.  We only use a few drops of Jojoba, Argan and Coconut Oil on the hair on our head, and not all at one time. (We use these oils very liberally on our body, and very sparingly on our scalp/hair)  Remember, of all the oils mentioned above, Jojoba, Argan and Coconut Oil can be used very liberally and in this light we've personally found Majestic Pure Moroccan Oil to be the ""king"" of Moroccan Argan Oil, the quality shines above all others, there is no doubt about that, so we've made it our primary Argan Oil! It's the finest money can buy! Remember, using these oils is wonderful yet to attain the best results in terms of what these organic, cold pressed all natural oils can deliver, a healthy lifestyle always adds more ""fuel to the fire!"" That healthy lifestyle, for us includes eating a lot of salad and fruit, meat only once or twice a week, in that we eat a lot of fish and poultry, we exercise daily  and of course we're very sexually active. All these factors in addition to the oils noted in this review gives our skin a radiance and glow we haven't seen in some time as well as thicker, fuller hair from our heads to our feet.. Literally, our hair is thicker everywhere.. So, when considering which Argan Oil to use, I honestly have to say feel free to use high quality oils from Kate Blanc, Leven Rose and Teddie Organics (I rate these oils as excellent) Yet, when you want to supplement your Argan Oil usage with the very highest quality oil you can purchase,  the best on the market today, go with Majestic Pure Moroccan Argan Oil! You'll absolutely love it! We Do!!"
"This tea tree oil is as described in the description. I love that it comes with a dropper. That makes it easier to use without making a mess. I have several different essential oils from this brand and I’m satisfied with all of them."
"I buy this lemonade essential oil all the time. I use it in making my homemade cleaners. Love the price for the size of the bottle. I am a repeat buyer."
"I use this essential oil for aromatherapeutic cognitive  association. The olfactory sense is one of the most closely tied to cognition, memory, and emotion. It is more closely tied to our oldest evolutionary brains as any of our senses. The entire Majestic Pure brand is a quality provide or essential oils for aromatherapy or topical application.Place these oils in a diffuser or atomizer and associate their various scents with your cognitive intentions—conscious and unconscious alike. They unmistakably capture the scents and profiles of each of their natural offerings. This is exceptional value without any compromise in quality."
"Perfect for mixing with other oils or by itself.  Good value , would definitely buy again"
"It is quite strong, but is a nice smell. I live in an apartment at the end of a long hall.  While walking up to the elevator I could smell it all the way up the hall.  I hope the others like it too. lol  I put some in the bottom of a small glass with a thick bottom on a cup warmer."
"I've been using this lavender essential oil brand for a few years now, and it has been great so far. The quality is consistent, and the fragrance is calming and pleasant."""
"Item is just as described. Great value. I'm very pleased"

Whether you're looking to treat yourself or give a thoughtful gift, this set is a wonderful choice.Highly recommended for anyone who loves high-quality fragrance oils!"
"Sorry for the long review, lol, just wanted to be as detailed as possible.I’m giving this product 4 stars because despite the downsides, it was relatively cheap. I think you more or less get what you pay for with these.For the record, I got these scents for slime and potentially soap making, and for my infuser though I haven’t used them for soap making yet.Upsides:- You get a lot of different scents for the price (though do note that each bottle is fairly small)- Some of the scents are clear which is always nice, some are brown but that shouldn’t be a problem unless you get it on clothing or plan to use it in a clear slime or soap.- Seller is very helpful. Like I say in the downsides, the packaging isn’t great, but the seller responded within 48 hours and offered to replace the broken bottles and a sincere apology.- The essential oils did not cause any skin sensitivity, even when I accidentally got some directly on my hands.- I am prone to migraines, especially with scents. Just a tiny whiff of perfume can cause me to have a major headache. None of these scents caused me any issues. Good if you’re sensitive to certain scents or perfumes.- Most don’t smell bad when mixed.- It doesn’t all pour out at once.Downsides:- Packaging isn’t great. 1 bottle broke in shipping, the other leaked. The one that broke was brown, so it did stain my bathroom rug (I tend to make slime in my shower for easy clean up), but that’s not a huge deal because it’s $20. Be careful when opening your box and don’t open it around stainable stuff. Seller was responsive and offered to replace the broken bottles. When they sent the replacement, all bottles did come intact.- You need to use a lot of oil to be able to scent stuff, or at least slime in my case. The stronger scents (like blueberry muffin) took about 1/8th of the bottle to scent a 10 ounce slime (no clay, just a basic slime), but the weaker scents (like cotton candy) barely scented anything at all. Another 10 ounce slime required almost the entire bottle and even that only gave it an almost undetectable smell. It more just masked the glue-type smell slimes typically have before scent is added in.- The scent labels aren’t always exactly accurate.- The website on the box and slime bottles is inaccessible.- So, so, so hard to get the oils out of the bottles. Requires a lot of shaking and banging, which kind of splatters it everywhere (the bottles are already very small, so every drop is precious). The drops don’t really coke out very evenly. This would certainly make it hard to measure if you’re trying to create an exact recipe that you want to be able to replicate in the future.Favorite scent:Blueberry muffinAccuracy: smells more like a blue raspberry type scentStrength: strongest for sure, but stillPleasantness: loved the smell, simply perfectOther scents included:Cotton candyAccuracy: Honestly hard to tell because of how weak it is, but I think it’s fairly accurate?Strength: Insanely weak. Used almost the full bottle on a 10 ounce slime and could barely detect the scent.Pleasantness: Smells good from what I can tell but again, hard to determine due to how weak it is.StrawberryAccuracy: Smells more like strawberry frostingStrength: you definitely need to use a lot, but it’s not as weak as cotton candyPleasantness: I personally loved it, but I also love the smell of strawberry icing. It may be too sweet for some people.BrownieAccuracy: not at all accurate, just vaguely resembles the smell of cocoStrength: very strongPleasantness: This one smelled the worst, I actually threw it away. It smelled like how that chocolate protein powder made from peas tastes. It’s like if you took all of the sugar out of a chocolate bar.French VanillaAccuracy: Smells exactly like vanilla extractStrength: fairly weakPleasantness: smells pretty good, like I said, just like vanilla extract.MarshmallowAccuracy: absolutely no idea, could barely smell itStrength: super duper weakPleasantness: I guess it smells good? Can barely smell it.Sugar cookieAccuracy: Smells just like sugar cookiesStrength: Fairly week like most other scents, but not *too* badPleasantness: Great, very sugary.CoconutAccuracy: smells like coconut oilStrength: so so, about as strong as the other products.Pleasantness: I’m not a good judge in this as I don’t like the smell of coconut.Apple PieAccuracy: smells like a sweeter version of the harvest spicesStrength: a bit stronger than most of the others, but not as strong as the blueberry muffinPleasantness: very niceHarvest SpiceAccuracy: Smells like what you’d expectStrength: a bit stronger than the apple piePleasantness: Also very nice"
"My oils arrived yesterday. They were wrapped really well and securely to protect the glass bottles themselves. However, similar to many other reviews, the bottles had leaked all over the inside and the bottles weren't full (likely as a result of the leaking). I opened each bottle and tested them to find that not all of the droppers worked either. Specifically, I had to entirely remove 1 dropper from the bottle to get the product out.Regarding the product themselves, they smell heavenly. I use floral scented oils for homemade carpet powder/upholstery refresher and on wool dryer balls. These are potent and upon making carpet powder, made my entire finished basement smell as if I had walked into a fresh flower shop.When considering whether or not I'd repurchase, I think I probably would try another brand first to see if they arrived with less leakage but overall, not a horrible product."
"I love them they smell so good in my diffuser's I use them in my wax in my carpet shampooer also it's great gift I can't wait to get more"
"Nice smells but sadly leaking when arrived so missing some liquid and a mess instead"
"Came well packaged - however one had slightly leaked in transit."
"The media could not be loaded."
"I was looking for scents to add to my candles and thought these would be perfect as candle making was mentioned in the features. Sadly, although they smell 🤤 incredible, there is no scent throw in the wax. I'll be giving them away as gifts to friends with diffusers."
"5/5 RatingThis is one of the only scents that just about every women who smelled it loves it. I got this for my diffuser to liven up my place, a friend came over and smelled it, she LOVED it. I used at my Dad's place one time and everyone seemed to love it there as well.  Even bout it for a friend and his lounge, it was a hit there as well.Do yourself a favor and get it.ProsSmells GreatComes in large bottleHas an earthy Masculine scentConsA little pricey"
"I love the smell of wanderlust it have your home smelling good when you come in."
"I bought the midnight and it smells amazing. However there is no dropper or dispenser on the bottle. A little bit goes a long way, so it’s difficult to pour into a diffuser without making a mess."
"I have bought these multiple times why because the value for my money is there,The smell is good, and it lasts a long time."
"Got this for my hubby to use in a waterless diffuser in  his truck. works great and smells fantastic has that smell that men love he usually like the ice smell but this is better."
"Haven’t used yet but because the box came with the contents leaking inside it I can certainly smell. It does smell great just sad it leaked."
"What I liked about the product is that you receive a lot versus the other brands. What I don’t like is that the smell of the scent is very very very mild. I can barely smell it compared to the original scent. I do understand this is a dupe but it needs to be stronger in my opinion. But I guess I get what I pay for."
"i love this fragrance and how it lingers . It’s a nice elegant smell . The only drawback back is that it didn’t come with a dropper or dropper cap , so when you pour some into diffuser a lot can come out . That’s why I gave it 4 stars"
"I don’t know if you’re like me and love the smell of cedar if you do you will not be disappointed in this oil.Product packaging is fantastic oil comes in a tinted glass bottle with a reusable lid and a glass dropper. I love that the glass is tinted because this adds longevity to the oil. Oil is priced well for a 4oz bottle I have spent much more on a bottle of 4oz oil in the past not to mention that other brands will provide plastic droppers or bottles or once you remove the original cap you cannot use them again and are stuck using the dropper as the lid.Sent is amazing and fresh no rancid smelling oil. The smell of cedar is one of those smells that brings so many memories of my childhood and father and this one had the memories rushing back as soon as I opened it and got the first smell of the oil. Sent is long lasting and even after 16 hours I could still smell it on the items I have sprayed it on.I plan on making a variety of different DIY projects with this oil I have already made a spray for my dogs with homemade rose water and adding a few drops of the oil to my spray for them. I love the fact that adding the cedar oil to the spray helps with deterring bugs while also making their coats soft and smell amazing, and not having to use the chemically created sprays that are offered for sale currently. Not to mention that I can make a ton of spray from this one bottle and with the perfumed dog spray costing so much I am going to save a ton of money making my own spray for them. I have plans to use the oil for various other things like my oil warmer for a affordable room sent, in my drawers for moth prevention and also adding a wonderful sent to my clothes, candle making and anything else I can dream up the list of things I will be using the oil for is a long one. And you won’t be disappointed with the smell because it smells amazing! I will definitely be purchasing it again in the future and I cannot wait to try some of the other oils from this brand and seller."
"I recently started using thyme essential oil, and I am thoroughly impressed! The quality of this oil is outstanding, and it has quickly become a staple in my wellness routine.First and foremost, the aroma is absolutely delightful—earthy and herbal, it’s perfect for aromatherapy. I love diffusing it in my living space; it creates a calming atmosphere while also helping to clear my sinuses during cold seasons. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my respiratory comfort when I use it, especially during allergy season.I also appreciate its versatility. I’ve used thyme essential oil in my homemade cleaning products, and it adds a fresh scent while providing antimicrobial benefits. Plus, it’s been fantastic for my digestive health. A few diluted drops in warm water after meals have helped with bloating and discomfort.What I love most is that it’s safe to use topically when diluted properly. I’ve applied it to minor cuts and bruises, and it seems to speed up the healing process while reducing inflammation.Overall, I highly recommend thyme essential oil for anyone looking to enhance their health and wellness naturally. It’s effective, multipurpose, and has a wonderful scent—definitely a five-star product!"
"Grapefruit is one of the freshest clean smelling essential oil fragrances.  I use this product in the household cleaners and laundry products I make at home.  This is a great product for a low price."
"I have to start off by saying the packaging of this product is beautiful. There’s a glass dropper that goes with the bottle and it’s well protected inside the packaging. You can tell there is love in this company. The only reason I’m giving it a 4 star is because it’s fragrance is not like an actual Vanilla like I was hoping. It was a little too “perfumy” if that makes sense. I wish this brand would have a vanilla bean scent!"
"It smells like black licorice, which I am not a fan of, but it added the scent I needed to achieve the new scent, if that makes sense."
"I honestly don’t know what sandalwood is supposed to smell like. I have never bent down to gently inhale the aroma from a sandalwood in nature. Until 2 minutes ago I had no idea what the source was other than a vague notion it was likely a plant of some sort. This product is an entirely accurate representation of what I believe to be sandalwood fragrance. Seriously, it smells good, no weird sweaty sock undertones or whatever it is that makes some smell like a hospital version of your favorite childhood food. The fragrance lasts. If one were to, for example, drop the entire bottle on the bathroom floor, you would not be disappointed with how quickly the smell disappeared. Obviously a completely ’out of the blue, nobody is that clumsy’ scenario I made up."
"Wanted to try out a new fragrance for my candles and thought the combo would smell nice. Before I took the stopper out the scent was really strong but as soon as I took the stopper out the scent died down big time. I had to use more than I do for other fragrances just to smell something. I wouldn’t buy this scent again."
"Ordered to refresh my cinnamon broom - i didn’t care for the scent. To me it smelled like a wet cinnabon, but i prefer a really offensively strong scent of essential oils. My husband threw out my broom because he said it “went bad.” However, i regifted the remaining amount to my mom who LOVED IT, so tastes vary!"
"You really can't go wrong with the Spearmint Oil. It is top-shelf AAAA quality. Its scent is extremely pleasant and potent without being overpowering. I have to believe this is the best quality that can be achieved. Top marks to PHATOIL! *****/5"
"This is the second bottle of PHATOIL peppermint oil I have bought from this company.  We have 2 very large raised beds that stand on pavers to stop them rotting in our back garden and unfortunately last year a rat moved in under a bed and made a nest.  We tried everything to get rid of the rat, which of course became more than one but nothing worked. I had heard that they don’t like mint so bought the peppermint oil to spray under the raised beds, it worked. We didn’t have critters digging up my potato’s, or eating my strawberry’s and tomato this year. However our dogs have become very agitated around the raised beds again which means another critter has moved in so it’s time to spray peppermint oil under and behind the beds again, hopefully with the same success.  It also smells nice in the burner."
"Large bottle for the price. Happy"
"Lovely product. Bought for my daughter who had a rat in her attic. They hate peppermint smell. Put peppermint oils on cotton wool and place in attic, yes it helped to send him off."
"Beautiful presentation of this item upon arrival, it was wrapped so no mess could happen (great care taken). I bought this to go in my waterless diffuser and in reed diffuser for my bathroom. I think it's a lovely sent and reminds me of the Yara fragrance by Laffata Perfumes from the UAE. Long lasting and it works perfectly with my reed diffuser. I also purchased Secret and omgosh it's heavenly. I put that sent in a reed diffuser for my 18yro bathroom. She wanted to dip her fingers in it and apply it directly to her neck lol. I think whatever sent you buy will deliver exactly what you expect. 100% recommend"
"I have been struggling, trying to find the right scent for my home. I finally tried the “The Magic Scent” “Secret”. This is absolutely my favorite scent out of everything I have tried. I’m now purchasing several of the other scents from this line and redoing my whole house. AMAZING"
"I loved this!  Came fast! The scent last & is very powerful. I haven’t used my diffusers in a few days, and when I walk in, the whole house is still illuminating with the smell… I’m definitely ordering again!"
"Mahogany and Teakwood is my favorite, but all of them smell great! This is my favorite brand to use in my diffusers!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I got the bamboo scent and although I haven’t been to the Four Seasons in Bora Bora, I would imagine that this would smell just like it as it is elegant and high class. I like strong smells and this is something I would recommend if you like them as well. The scent last and fills the room in about 10 minutes. With the diffuser off, I would still smell the scent which is a plus. For me, it’s not overwhelming and doesn’t cause any headaches. I use a rechargeable waterless diffuser. I use the diffuser between my car and bedroom. I also used Hotel Collections in the past for my go to but now with The Magic Scent, I have a new array of scents to choose from. So far, excellent product and company. I would say that it would be nice to have a sample size of each scent so I would be able to smell others before committed to purchasing a full size bottle. The price isn’t an issue as long as quality is there, I would purchase again. Thanks."
"Great product!  Would purchase again for sure!"
"Excellent!!!!! Love this scent!!!! It’s great"
"Smells incredible! Wonderful whole house scent, love coming home too!"
"I recently tried this air freshener, and I have to say, the scent is reminiscent of a fresh cologne, which I absolutely love. It adds a sophisticated touch to my space. One thing I appreciated was having to turn the warmer down a couple of notches compared to other brands I've used. This adjustment helps the fragrance last longer, making it more cost-effective in the long run. Overall, a great product that strikes the perfect balance between scent strength and longevity!"
"That has been our scent for a while and we always get compliments when we have friends over. It’s a great value since it last long. We also never had any problems with leaking. It’s great!"
"I was using lavender with White Flowers and just loved how it smelled out of the package and in the diffuser. But it did not last as long and the aroma intensity waned during it's 2 week life span. In comparing this new Lavender with Waterlilies, I was initially unimpressed. However, in the new diffusers, the fragrance has grown on me and it is lasting longer. It is stronger than the White Flowers off the bat, but it's aroma stays at the same potency day after day. The AC picks up the scent and I get gentle whiffs throughout the house. The mightier aroma of the Waterlilies is a high fly home run in the Laundry area and the Bathroom.Two weeks later, the scent seems normal, it overpowers dirty socks in the hamper, the bottle is still three  fifths full (lowest setting).And, I periodically get a faint trace of the fragrance as I go through the house.I actually bought separately a 5 pack of the the fragrance and a 4 pack of the New Diffusers.There is bundle with both that is just easier to order.Give the fragrance a week, because if you have been using a dainty scent it may seem strong initially.The New Advanced Scent Warmers with this new Lavender with Waterlilies are beautifully lit and easier to use and my refill is lasting longer. The new Advanced Scent Warmers can be bought by themselves or with a bundle, but they are So worth the 16 dollars for a Four pack."
"Lasts a longwhile - vibrant and strong scent. Great value and cute decor"
"First time purchasing eucalyptus & wild berries scent. I love it! My one & only complaint is that one of the bottles is empty. After opening the box it was shipped in i could smell the scent. The inside of the box was not wet but the pkg the refills come in was opened at the bottom and that was wet. I haven't taken the bottles out of its pkg yet. I don't understand how that could've been missed. For what i see, lt was already like this, the packers didn't care and just sent it to the customer which happens to be me. Packers need to pay more attention."
"The product was not expensive. The smell iris like being at a spa.The functionality of the product worked well; i did not experience any leakage, and the longevity of the product is worth having. I had my warmers for two years and they still are working till this day. They omitt beautiful scents. I really enjoy this scent and intend to purchase again."
"I have received so many compliments from people who enter my home. They are functional, don’t leak, easy to use and provide a great scent. They are a good value for the price."
"I lovvve this air wick flavor! I have two teenage boys and it has worked great for their rooms! I will continue to use this fragrance especially for their rooms!"
"Great scent"
"So I got this for my car air freshener - it's a little black thing that has a wooden round disc inside and when the sun hits it, it spins really fast dispensing the smell. And after a few months of having it, the wood disc doesn't smell anymore so I figured I would just soak the disk in the oil - and it works! I love this scent, it smells like a.... man. Idk how else to describe it. I'm a fan of Black Ice - so it's similar but not the same."
"I‚Äôve been using essential oils instead of fabric softener for a while now and this is by far the most fragrant one I‚Äôve had! Makes my laundry smell so clean and fresh!!"
"I love this essential oil. It actually smells like linen! I ordered 4 different oils all marketed as linen essential oil. I kept this one and returned the others. Very happy with my purchase and just ordered another bottle. Highly recommend."
"Smells good and lasts long. Find a small piece of wood and squirt the oil all over it. Throw the piece of wood under a seat in your car. Long lasting smell good."
"It was wrapped in a loose bubble bag. 1/3 of the liquid was leaked. Some nice this is not a prime purchase I did not have time to return it so I kept it. Smell is good . But I am gonna look for the better option on my next purchase"
"This smells great in my diffuser"
"This is a great product to put Into your ac filter to make your home smell fantastic!"
"Great aroma at laundry time with this scent on my wool drying balls."
"Great product and customers love this fragrance! I use this product in my handmade bath and body business to make bath bombs, body oils, sprays, and salt scrubs/soaks. This is a very good neutral fragrance for customer's especially if they are purchasing something for someone else. It has a creamy honey, coconut and almond scent as the title says and it doesn't disappoint. I will continue to order from this company and have ordered 20 fragrances from them thus far and they all are of high quality and this company does a really good job explaining the fragrance as a whole and I have yet to find one that doesn't match what they say - I highly recommend this company. Their products come in glass bottles which I really like and they hold the fragrance really well in all of my products - each medium will hold a different level of scent and a different portion of the scent - so my body oils you can smell the entire fragrance; where as my salt scrubs and soaks have stronger notes of the honey and my bath bombs have a stronger creamy almond smell so it just depends on what medium you use for your product. Overall, fantastic product and will continue to order from this company."
"I figured this oil was going  to have a strong cedar scent, but its actually not that strong, you can smell it, but mixed with the leather scent it muted it a bit...Definitely balanced well!  I definitely plan to buy more when I run out"
"I use this to make my own body spray. It smells amazing and the scent lasts a long time. Great purchase."
"I licked this oil when I got it as part of the 8 scent package I received several months ago. So, I ordered this specific scent based on that and I am very happy that I have it again. It's not a fruity or floral scent, it has a more earthy masculine fragrance, perfect for me."
"The BEST cotton candy scent I’ve found. I’ve spent a lot of money over the past 9 months on finding the perfect scents. As far as a cotton candy goes, you won’t find a better one than this! I will say that it could be stronger, other than that it’s perfect."
"The bottle is a decent size moneys worth for sure last w long time.i don't really care for smell but that's juste.not that it's a bad smell just not for me."
"Well worth the price bc the scent is amazing. I used these to make candles and the scent is super strong and I have gotten nothing but compliments on how wonderful my candles smell. Especially the pumpkin spice and homemade pumpkin pie scent. I will definitely be buying more."
"I liked the great smell.don,t like that it's not enough of it"
"Works perfectly with my reed diffusers and smells excellent!"
"I do like the fragrance which is very light. Wished it was a bit more potent"
"The quantity of the refill for the price is very good. Some of the name brands prices for smaller amounts are pretty substantial. Only the selection is a bit of a shortcoming."
"saves time & a little $ if you want to do your own refillsWatched the ""how-to"" videos before purchasing. This is where I stopped making & started buying!I don't want to be a chemist. Besides I had all these fine little bottles and could not find any dbl units that only had one scent in the dbl bottles! So it takes 10 ml per Wix bottle (divided into the 500ml bulk refill.) vs $ for a completely new unit. (What if I don't like Hawaiian & Lavender spewing out at the same time?) My compromise solution, I guess."
"I am disappointed -- fragrance does NOT permeate the room at all"
"Love the scent coming from my reed diffuser!"
"I find the scent is pleasant but very weak. If you prefer very subtle then this will work for you."
"Iâ€™ve been on numerous long flights and have never been able to find a travel pillow that allows me to sleep comfortably, especially in the section of an airplane that doesnâ€™t fully recline into a bed. This travel pillow is perfect. Itâ€™s easy to travel with, itâ€™s comfortable, and I donâ€™t wake up with neck pain, it keeps my head and neck comfortable, prevent me from snoring on the plane and I sleep so well with it. Iâ€™ve tried many pillows, but this one is one of the best ones Iâ€™ve ever tried, and a great value for the money. I purchase several for my family members who travel Internationally as well, it makes a great gift - I highly recommend it."
"This pillow was JUST what we needed for our long drive from FL to MA. We took turns napping with it and holy crap, it helped our necks a lot. Driving is already stressful enough, we wanted a little bit of relief when we could manage it. It is soft but durable, the shape fits your head and neck how you want it to, the clip is adjustable and could probably fit most neck sizes, and was easy to find a good cozy spot no matter how I positioned myself in the car. High value for low cost. My only laugh is the case/cover it came inâ€¦ donâ€™t plan to get it back in there, it expanded when I took it out and it just wonâ€™t go back in lol. Iâ€™m fine with that, itâ€™s more useful being ready to go. Enjoy!"
"re: CSJT Travel Pillow Vacuum Compressed Memory Foam Neck Pillow Review:As an avid traveler, I'm always on the lookout for products that can elevate my travel experience, and the CSJT Travel Pillow has certainly exceeded my expectations. This pillow offers a real sleeping experience, making long flights or road trips incredibly comfortable and rejuvenating.One of the standout features of this pillow is its memory foam construction, which provides exceptional support to both the neck and shoulders. This has been a game-changer for me, as I no longer wake up with stiffness or soreness after hours of travel. The pillow molds perfectly to my body, ensuring that I can relax and rest peacefully throughout the journey.What sets the CSJT Travel Pillow apart is its vacuum-compressed design. This not only makes it incredibly lightweight and easy to carry but also allows for convenient storage when not in use. I appreciate how compact it becomes after compression, fitting snugly into my carry-on without taking up too much space.Furthermore, the pillow's super-soft fabric adds to the overall comfort, making it a pleasure to rest against during long flights. The fact that it's machine-washable is a bonus, ensuring that it stays clean and hygienic even after multiple uses.In summary, the CSJT Travel Pillow has become an essential part of my travel kit. Its superior comfort, support, and portability make it a must-have for anyone looking to make their journeys more enjoyable and restful. I highly recommend this pillow to fellow travelers seeking a real sleeping experience on the go."
"We love this pillow. I purchased two of them to use on a long train trip we are taking. We've tried it out several times each and love them! Very well made. The pillow can be turned to support your neck in any position. The material used to create the pillow is both sturdy and very comfortable. The carry case is excellent for keeping it clean and ready to go. The strap with secure clasp will enable us to clip it to each of our backpacks. Very nice and highly recommended for anyone who likes to travel or who tends to fall asleep while watching TV ;-)."
"I purchased this neck/travel pillow for my upcoming trip to Spain. However since then I tore my ACL, had surgery and have had to work from home. I have been using Immersed on the Quest 3 to have multiple screens but it is bulky and hurts my neck if I use it too long.  Then I realized, travel pillow! This thing has been a gamechanger.It is very supportive of my neck, especially when sitting for long periods. It is comfortable, firm, and very transportable. I believe it a good price for the quality and would highly recommend.To be transparent, it is sometimes tricky to get back in the carrying case, it may take 2-3 tries of rolling it, but I've always managed to get it back in.In summary if you need neck support this is a fantastic option."
"I bought this travel pillow because I'm traveling a lot this summer and fall, both in a car and plane. It comes with its own case so I can sling it over my suitcase or my shoulder. It is very easy to put on and quite comfortable. I can easily fall asleep in the car or plane while wearing the pillow. Most importantly, I don't have any neck pain after a long car or plane ride. I'm also using it at night while I sleep, and it helps me maintain a neutral position while I sleep. I highly recommend this pillow."
"Iâ€™m a petite female with a small neck. This pillow did not work for me. For reference, Iâ€™ve included photos of my neck area plus a couple photos with the neck pillow. If your chin and neck area is shaped similar to mine, I recommend trying a different pillow.On the plus side, the fabric is very smooth and silky, and I do like how the back portion of the cushion is nice and flat. Itâ€™s a pillow was the right size for you, I think it would definitely feel nice.However, when I tightened the strap all the way, I still had a pretty significant gap between the cushion and the front of my neck. So then when I allowed my head to drop forward, my chin dropped into the gap, and I ended up sort of dangling on my cheekbones (see photo.) NOT comfortable. Likewise, the pillow slid around when I dropped my head to the side, preventing me from getting true support.(My husband - who has a larger frame than mine - also had trouble with his chin falling through. So this problem may not be unique to petite females.)"
"I bought this neck pillow for a long flight and it kept me comfortable the whole time. The firm design helps hold the neck straight and still provides functionality. It's very light weight, and great value for the money. I'd recommend trying it out!"
"This neck pillow is exactly what you need for international travel. It’s so comfortable and lightweight. I fell asleep for hours on a flight to Spain and woke up with no neck pain. Slept like a baby. Side note- when I first opened it I almost returned it. It was vacuum sealed and didn’t look anything like the picture. It was completely flat. I left it out for about a half an hour, and it returned to its original form and was soft  and plush. Buy it!!"
"I really like how this neck pillow is made, it's a very soft fabric without hard edges like the blow up ones and it has multiple snaps so you can really fit it to your neck comfortably! I sprained my neck, so this has been a life saver for sleep and to help hold my rice bag. It comes vacuum sealed, but all you have to do is lay it out and squish it around to get air back into it."
"The fabric and pillow are both soft. It's easy to attach onto anything. It didn't sit as comfortably around my neck and big hair as I had hoped, but you can still use it as a pillow without putting it on your neck. Cover is easy to remove, wash, and reattach."
"I bought this for eye surgery recovery since I couldn't find my older one.  This one!  This is way different and works perfectly.  It has made the difference in my ability to sleep through the night!  I will be using this  every night from now on.  What a difference!  Highly recommend.  Very comfortable and keeps your neck supported w/o discomfort."
"I originally bought these when I got ear piercings to help me sleep but I absolutely love how comfortable they are. Super soft and I like the ability to clip the ends together. Perfect travel pillow."

"Good comfortable materials, durable, and can’t go wrong with this for the trips…."
"This neck pillow arrived on the day that my husband had shoulder replacement surgery and he has bragged and bragged on this new pillow. Last night was the first night that he slept in our bed, and in the meantime, this pillow provided hours of comfort in his time of healing, resting in his recliner. It was exactly what Dr. Wife ordered. This pillow has helped with the ""full recovery"" that I've prayed for."
"Very comfortable.  No edges that are harsh because its not a blow up one.  Soft.  I found turning it upside down works the best 😊  I never fall alseep on planes.  Slept for almost 3 hours"
"I was going to take this neck pillow with me to Japan as we had two evening flights.  I tried it out at home and it was too bulky, too firm and too uncomfortable.  Not easy to put in your bag on the plane, unless you're carrying a large bag.  I left it at home and haven't used it."
"Very comfortable"

"My daughter had a herniated disk in her neck. She was so uncomfortable between doctor appointments. We bought this hoping it would support her neck without that awkward collar. It's nice and firm...not soft like some you pick up at box stores. It is a memory foam to mold and support as you need it. It helped her when she was in a recliner or even lying back to keep from turning her head too quickly. Her doctor was fine with it."
"Pros- beautiful color, nice material, carry bag is handy, loop for attaching to bag, decently comfortable, and very affordableCons- takes awhile to expand when it first arrives, has a very potent smell for a few days, and is made for someone with a thicker neck (I have a more slender neck and it doesn't support very well because it slips around)"
"This head rest is a great addition to use for your chair or couch.  This is also great for passengers in a vehicle!  Pretty blue color and soft to touch, but sturdy.  It can even be hung up when not in use.  It is very nice to have this, and I use it when watching TV.  Worth the price for sure!"
"So comfy. Has a strap for travel and also comes with a little travel bag that keeps it clean. The strap easily attaches to a backpack or luggage handle. I use it most at night when my GERD is kicking up and I have to sleep in my recliner. Keeps my neck from getting sore with a crik. Memory foam is so nice, soft and comfy. And the snap in the front keeps it from falling off. Didn't know I needed it, now I can't live without it!"
"Very hard filling. No give at all. Keeps neck immobilized but felt like a was in a straight jacket. Wish it was softer."
"I ordered this because I was going on a ten hour drive - 10 going and 10 returning.It saved my neck from being stiff and sore.  The only problem I had with it is that the material is so soft, my grandkids kept trying it out.  I finally had to hide it so that I would have it for the return trip.  I am thinking that I may have to get a couple as a gift to them."
"Very comfy and easy to take the cover out and clean."
"The pillow is both"
"high quality product. Highly recommended."
"The product is very nice. It was sent as a gift and the person who received it loved it!"
"Have tried all types of travel pillows for use in reclined sofas, airplane seats. This one is simple and comfortable. Nice if it came with a clear plastic travel bag I've seen strapped to luggage or back packs."
"This pillow is amazing!"
"When I used to lie on the beach to sunbathe, I would use a beach towel or an inflatable pillow. They were portable, but they never felt quite comfortable. After seeing this travel pillow, I purchased this one, and it is now one of my must-have items for our beach trips. It looks cute, compact and doesn’t take up much space, light, and easy to pack into its waterproof storage bag. Its size is perfect for one person to lie on. The surface is soft cotton, and the inside is filled with sponge blocks and offers medium support, it feels lasting. When I lie down, the height is just right for my neck, and it feels comfortable with good rebound and support without feeling stuffy. Sometimes, when my back needs a little support while napping, I also use it. After use it's easy to shake off sand and pet hair. The pillowcase is removable and washable. It has made sunbathing on the beach much more comfortable. I'm satisfied with its performance, so I give it five stars."
"Doesn't come with a bag to repack after use but small/mighty. Good memory foam pillow option for camping"
"I bought this to use on my camping trips to avoid bringing my own pillows from home. I typically car camp in a tent or a primitive cabin, so I'm not worried much about having something that is super light and packable, but this pillow is fairly light and could definitely be packed into a smaller bag than what it comes in if it were totally necessary. It seems to have foam chunks inside that give it a little more flexibility but it is actually very comfortable. I am a back and side sleeper and I found it to be the most comfortable when I was on my back since it is not very thick. The cover is soft and removable for easy washing. It is a great travel pillow for car camping or for roadtrips. Im considering another to keep in my car with my emergency kit. Living in the northeast, you never know when a blizzard might leave you stranded!"
"I just received this travel pillow, and it’s really soft and comfortable. The quality is also great, very suitable for long-distance car use, in short, is very satisfied with a shopping!"
"I really like this pillow super comfy I would definitely purchase again! I actually bought it for the car it’s perfect size not too small or too big!"
"Easy to pack and fluffs up quickly. It's comfortable and firm enough for a travel pillow."
"Small pillow for camping, and reasonably soft. I prefer a little firmer, as the shape doesn't hold at all. It packed down small, but I'd rather just use a sweatshirt next time"
"I love this little pillow. I bought this for a trip to use mainly on the plane and during transport. I have always had a hard time with the typical neck pillows because the sides are just too high for my neck and I can never get comfortable. This little pillow was perfect. It’s full of chopped up memory foam pieces, making it easy to squish and fit how and where I wanted it. It’s pretty soft and squishy, but I found it gave me the support I needed. The pillow cover is breathable and soft, and the travel case is a nice touch! Definitely recommend!"
"I received my order today. These pillows are for a gift. The pillows arrived in a flat vacuum sealed plastic bag. After removing from the bad they are very flat, but… I put them in the dryer with a wet washcloth & now they are perfect & fluffy. I do this to all my pillows once a month. I would buy these pillows again."
"Quality y size exact. Nicest small pillowsI've purchased. Would buy again. Pillow cases also match y nice silky quality."
"These came so FLATE! No instructions but after reading some reviews I chanced washing them before sending them back. They came out perfectly-nice plump little pillows like I expected when ordered them. NO where do they tell you this."
"They’re perfect for a baby or toddler. They’re not too fluffy."
"Absolutely amazing the way this small flat pillow fluffed up.  I put in the dryer Low with a damp clean washcloth for 15 minutes and pillows were transformed into wonderful soft clouds.  I have bought toddler pillows for twice the price of these pillows for only one. These come in a pack of 2.  I will definitely buy these again.  They are so soft and comfy.  So very pleased with my purchase."
"I used to get the best travel size/toddler pillows at my local Walmart. They no longer carry them. I took a chance and ordered this set of 2 travel size/toddler pillows. The size was perfect. The price was comparable to others I saw online (if not a little bit cheaper). I received them and was very disappointed. They were kinda flat and underfilled. One of them was even flatter and less filled then the other one. I was disappointed by the thinness when I was expecting a better quality. The pillows were not comfortable. The material of the pillow cases was nice quality. I just wish they had more filling."
"Those pillows arrive very flat. It didn't come with instructions but after reading all the bad reviews I learned it needed to be put in the dryer. They did fluff up but did not fill the case by any means. I am not able to return these because I need them for a gift. Sadly I will have to rip out the seams and add more stuffing...I should have just made my own pillows but thought I could save time. I will not purchase from this company again."
"This is a very comfortable and well-made pillow. I bought some for my dog's bed. He loves it and sleeps on it. Good quality. Affordable price!"
"As a flight attendant, I frequently have soso hotel pillows… they are either too soft or too firm or bother my allergies. This pillow is the perfect size for regular use. It compresses to a nice size to not take up too much space. The quilted design of the pillow cover is very cozy. My only issue is the compression bag it is in is a poor quality… after two uses, the drawstring ripped through the fabric… I can still compress the pillow, but the bag is unsightly and probably will not last much longer.No issues with smell from the foam. It maintains its shape and fluffiness over time.I’m definitely happy with the quality, support and value"
"Very comfortable pillows. Keeps my head cool throughout the whole night. Very good value. Has a good firmness. It’s adjustable to your liking and seems durabile"
"The 4-star rating isn't because there was anything wrong with the pillow. It's because the manufacturer doesn't label their product appropriately. I went to a lot of time and trouble to verify that I had the correct pillow. Simply identify the product as you did on the order web page.I received a set of 2 pillows as expected, however there was no indication ON the box or IN the box that this was a cooling pillow. The box looked nothing like the picture. The box in the picture clearly says it is a cooling pillow. Now I have to go to the Amazon website and try to determine IF I have the correct pillow. The picture also shows a bag of Extra Memory Foam. I did not see this in the box.The cooling pillow is made of viscose bamboo, sort of. It says ""Viscose made from Bamboo infused Outer cover"". The other pillow is labeled a side, back sleeper, and stomach sleeper which the cooling pillow is also. The other pillow says the material is memory foam but also says ""Modal Fiber & Viscose made from bamboo Cover"". Am I confused yet? YES!The 2 pillow set is vacuumed packed. I don't want to open a pillow in case it's the wrong one. Nothing on the outside of the vacuum-packed pillow gives me a solid clue. The customer website indicated on the included marketing materials does not work. A Google search of the pillow directs me to Amazon. The pillow is sold by Qatello LLC. No contact information there. I contact Amazon support. They were not able to find out either, so they issued an exchange.Last ditch effort out of curiosity, I opened one of the pillows. I opened the zipper to view the tag where I expected to find  what the materials were made of. Low and behold, there was an additional bag of memory foam inside of a net bag that was sealed. If you want to add just the right amount of form, you have to cut open the extra memory foam bag. Now you have to properly store the rest. Nothing like the picture. Also, the materials indicated that they were made from viscose made from bamboo, which is meaningless since both pillows contain viscose made from bamboo. So maybe they're both cooling pillows.I canceled the exchange order. This could all have been avoided if the box and packaging materials inside indicated that this is a COOLING PILLOW. Also should indicate that the extra memory foam bag is located inside the pillow and can be removed.I fluffed up the pillow in a low dryer setting for a few minutes. Boom! Big and fluffy. I left the extra foam bag inside the first night. I am a side sleeper, so it was a bit too firm. I removed the bag the next night. The pillow is VERY COMFORTABLE. I no longer flip my pillow all night long because it gets too warm.It DOES KEEP COOL. I only flip it when changing sides because the foam has settled."
"This pillow lives up to the manufacturer’s description. It puffed up in the drier and did not have a lingering smell. It was comfortable to use. It crushed back down into the sack thus making it a light weight, packable item."
"I use this for car camping and it is fantastic. Super compact and comfortable, definitely a good choice."
"I first purchased this pillow about a year ago and it was the best pillow I had ever used. I have some neck issues and this pillow was perfect in every way for me. Great support once I adjusted the fill yet still so soft. However, I purchased the exact same pillow twice again more recently and returned both of them - the fill was lumpy and flat. Very uncomfortable. The memory foam appeared very different from the foam in the first one I had purchased. I wasnt brave enough to try again so I purchased a different pillow not from Amazon. I was so incredibly happy with the first one but so let down by subsequent pillows. I’m not sure why the drastic change but was unhappy with the lack of consistency."
"I bought this Nappler Small Shredded Memory Foam Pillow for a camping trip I took with my girl scout troop. I am more of a glamper than a camper, everything I have learned about camping is through my girl scout trainings and the wonderful world of YouTube. My troop wanted to go camping at the aquarium, so of course as the wonderful troop leader I am, I set it up. The aquarium allowed us to bring a pillow and a twin air mattress. I immediately knew, I would be carrying many of my 3-4th grader's belongings because girls forget things.I picked this pillow because it is easy to fold up and light weight. I was easily able to clip this pillow on my backpack and go. The pillow was very comfortable and easily folded back up for the next use. I would absolutely recommend buying this if you are looking for light weight and comfortable!"
"Pros:You can take out the filling and find your perfect heightThe pillows come with extra filling (I made an entire other pillow with the extra filling)The pillow does have a nice cooling effectQuality bamboo washable coversWell made zippers to remove fillingThe shredded foam is a medium to firm density and fells nice on your headCons:Smell, Smell, Smell!!! I’ve had products that smelled but these pillows really smell! Had them outside in the sun for 2 days, sprayed them with Lysol fabric, and washed the covers, but they still smell. The smell is slowly starting to get better. If you can’t tolorate a chemical smell (like my sister), these are not for you.There are a few pieces of hard foam are in the pillow that you can feel from time to time.Would I recommend the pillows? Yes, if you can air them out for a few days to let the chemical smell dissipate. Overall a good value for the price."
"Wanted a nice comfortable pillow for when I travelled or camped. This is perfect!!! Nice and soft and comfy which packs lovely and small to chuck in your luggage"
"It's comfortable & compact! All of things needed in a camp pillow! Will get my own pillow protector custom made though & that would have been a great addition !"
"Brilliant quality just what I wanted."
"I was really nervous after reading some reviews, but gave it a try. I loved it and slept without any neck pain. I will say that it takes a little while to get used to the feeling of the bulkiness of this pillow, as well as how snug it fits around the neck. But it was so worth it when I was able to sleep for long periods of time of time on an international trip and would wake up without any of the typical neck discomfort. I found putting the high side closer to my chin beneficial, as well."
"I used this on my latest long-haul flight. It made sleeping in economy so easy and I was able to arrive well-rested. My neck was well supported throughout the flight."
"The first time I put on this pillow, I thought it was more comfortable than any other travel pillow I have used. It was soft and comforting to the point where I just want to sit there and take a nap. Some reviewers don't like the different or asymmetrical sides, but I like it and love to snuggle into the taller side tucking in my ear. It does ok with my super small earbuds but my Airpod pros get uncomfortable as it puts pressure on the top part of my ears. I like the support around my neck and love the super soft feel on my face. However, not all pillow are made equally. I gave my first pillow to my wife to try and she immediately stole it, so I had to buy another one. I purchased 4 more before I was able to find one with the same feel. I bought them in multiple colors and was surprised to find that each one had its own feel. One was more firm while another was not snug enough. I suggest that if you give these pillows a try, and I suggest you do, don't let anyone else try it or they may steal it away.When it comes to cost, it is more expensive than even the highest rated pillows out there. I have tried many of them and prefer to pay a little more for being able to sleep comfortably on a long trip.As far as carrying and storing this pillow, I will admit that I have to roll it up for other members of my family as it takes a little hand strength to shrink it down to fit in the carrying bag. I use a backpack and it fits nicely in the larger compartment with no problem. It is about the same as my previous neck pillow."
"I bought 3 of these for our trip to Australia and we all agreed that they were a game changer. We go to Australia every other year and this is best decision we made. When first put the neck pillow on thought this is too big and not going to work. Then left it on and best sleep we have ever had on a flight. No head bobbing and waking up from that. Great support. Can move pillow around for different height if want that. Velcro is adjustable and keeps pillow in place. Highly recommend this!"
"Bought to use for cross-Atlantic flights. Liked the sturdiness of the foam and the soft material cover, which can be removed and washed. The design is unique and elegant, but impractical for my needs. I have a short neck and one end of the pillow partially covered my ear, which made wearing either my noise cancelling headphones and earbuds (a must-have for me when flying) uncomfortable. Returned."
"First of all, I wanted to love this pillow. It came highly rated from multiple sources.I bought this for 9+ hour red-eye flights between the West Coast and London.Here are my observations:- Very awkward while in the storage bag. Because of its bulk, I had to tie it onto the outside of my messenger bag and it got caught on all kinds of things while moving thru the airport/onto the plane.- The pillow fits poorly & does not stay in place.- The pillow gets unpleasantly warm quite quickly (the foam holds heat).+ Cover fabric is very soft.When leaning my head towards the higher side of the pillow (as shown in the product video), it just slides over and tilts with the weight of my head, causing an uncomfortable position and unpleasant pressure against the opposite side of my neck.When leaning towards the low side of the pillow it didn’t slide/tip, but my face felt smooshed upwards and the pillow forced my earring to dig into my head.I have not yet found a way to get the pillow snug enough to stay in place without feeling like I am being smothered by the wrap portion that extends up above my chin.After trying to get this pillow positioned for over an hour, all I got was frustration & neck pain. I got zero sleep on the flight.All in all, this pillow was frustrating to use and completely underwhelmed me. If I hadn’t missed the return window. I would definitely send it back. Instead I’m out $60 and am stuck with a pillow I can’t use."
"I live in Hawaii, so any time I travel it is at least a 5 hour flight, and usually involves a red-eye.  After a fairly miserable trip to London, I decided to up the travel pillow game and give this a try.  I used it on a red-eye, and actually managed to sleep for about 4 hours.  I had a sleep mask, white noise on my headphones, and I don't know how, but I actually was fairly comfortable (even in the regular seats, not first class, def not lie-flat).  I just got back from another trip and decided to try this pillow again, even though it wasn't technically a red-eye.  I was pretty sure I wouldn't sleep, but I decided to try anyway.  I actually managed a couple of hours of sleep, which made a huge difference for my next day and recovery from jet lag."
"The only pros for this pillow are the fact that the material it is made out of is very pleasant to the touch and the memory foam. The Velcro strap that the pillow has does not account for different neck lengths or head sizes. You cannot tighten or loosen the pillow around the neck at all without it unfurling.Leaning into either side of the pillow causes it to unfurl or significantly shift position because the Velcro is barely able to hold it closed.In short fantastic comfort of the outer material and memory foam but you’d be better off looking elsewhere in terms of actual functionality and support from a neck pillow."
"The Ostrichpillow Go is more like a pillow neck brace (cervical collar) than a traditional travel pillow.When I first put it on I said to my wife, I’m sending this back. But she encouraged me to try it for longer. So I did.What I found was the Ostrichpillow is a neck support device that’s ultra cushioned and soft. It provides support to your whole neck. I positioned myself in several ways and found, after adjusting it, no matter what way my neck drooped or fell, this device held it just right so my neck muscles wouldn’t tire and I could feel comfortable enough to doze off.The thing is with these pillows, ya gotta feel comfortable enough so your neck muscles can let go from supporting your head and allow it to comfortably relax which ever way it falls. Including when you droop forward or down. The trick with the Ostrichpillow Go is to fasten the cushion under your chin, then you have the support needed to let go any which way your head decides to fall. At least this is how it has seemingly worked for me. When I purposely put my head to either the left or right (the Ostrichpillow has high cut cushions) it feels like you are laying your head down on a regular pillow in bed. When I nudged my head forward the weight was taken by the front cushioned area that attaches across the front of your neck providing substantial support without feeling like you need to re-adjust. Essentially you can sit upright in a chair and drift off without the need of added support from a wall or chair back and whatever direction your head falls, you’re comfortably supported. It probably looks funny. But that’s why I’m stating this is more like a large cushioned cervical collar. I suppose my experience is anecdotal and you can only try it for yourself to know if it would work for you. But aside from having a long sleep in this, it has been an interesting experience and I really like it. My mid afternoon naps have been grand.The only drawback I have experienced is because the sides of this pillow are cut high, they leave little room for my earbuds (AirPods Pro). I manage, but I have to be mindful to push the buds close to my ears and make sure they’re under the pillow. It’s doable, but needs a little fiddling.I don’t know if this is the most comfortable neck pillow for me. I can’t buy them all and try them. Well, with Amazon that may be possible, but after using this for several naps I’m really liking it now. I don’t want to part with it.Recommended"
"I had the regular U shaped neck pillow and wanted something better for my overnight nonstop flight to Barcelona. It was super easy to adjust and I found a good position quickly! I love that the positions are endless and once in place, it stays in place! It was soft and didn‚Äôt have any shipping smells. Mine also came with the stitching that people mentioned but it not an issue and I don‚Äôt think will be. It‚Äôs sewn tightly. I definitely will be keeping this! I didn‚Äôt use the eye mask. Carrying case is great too."
"Initially, I received what looked like a returned item (1 star withheld for this inconvenience). However, I initiated, without issue, a return and replace with Amazon and a day and a half later I received a new pillow.The pillow itself is of a super soft material on the outside and not too firm memory foam on the inside. It holds its shape when placed around the neck and will fit plus sized persons as well without issue. It comes with a black drawstring bag for storage but also has a snap strap attached to the pillow itself for ease when travelling if you don‚Äôt want to travel with the drawstring bag (NB - the snap strap started fraying upon first use, the rest of the pillow stood up fairly well to international travel however). It also comes with a pair of single use earplugs and an ok eye mask. It‚Äôs a decent size all around and felt quite comfortable without feeling like it was trying to smother or choke me. It also feels  and looks to be a well made, quality product and value for money, but only time will really tell if it holds up to the true rigours of travel."
"Not every travel pillow is perfect for everyone.  I bought and tried many before my recent trip to Europe.  This one was the winner for me.  Adjustable, great support and not hot.  I especially like to double it up when sleeping with head to the side.  Great price to boot!  Only downside as others have mentioned is that it is bulky.  Case was nice but I may purchase a compression packing cube to see if I can make it smaller to carry next time."
"I got the best sleep in my traveling career by using this pillow. Paired with a blackout mask and noise cancelling headphones, I was able to sleep for 7 of a 9 hour flight.The thickness is perfect, as you can adjust the pillow around your neck so that the thickness is where you choose- the design of it is super friendly for all types of sleeping arrangements for your head to rest comfortably.It supported my head and neck well, woke up feeling great, with no pain or soreness.I did wake up sweating, but that‚Äôs likely because I had a single sliver of an opening (of my own doing) to breath through as I slept . I don‚Äôt think it had anything to do with the pillow.Will definitely be purchasing again for my fiancee and if I misplace my current one!"
"I was on a 9 hr flight. After a while it did get uncomfortably warm and it is bulky to carry when not in use, but it was nice and soft. Good support."
"I have tried so many different pillows in my quest to find one that helps keep my chin from dropping to my chest when I sleep. This is the only one I have found that keeps my neck propped all night, while also beingcomfortable to sleep on. I agree with others that it is not super compact for traveling, but it comes with a travel bag, so it will be coming with me wherever I go. (I also bought a 2nd one as backup.)"
"This is the best neck pillow I‚Äôve found so far. It‚Äôs super soft and I love that you can mold it to how you want it. The one negative for me is it doesn‚Äôt really hold your neck up. Still 4 stars though!"
"Very comfortable and flexible to make that just-right snuggle fit to agree with just how you and the seat are getting along and if you have a window seat or have to drop down on your table or fortunately can actually get a seat that leans back a bit.  Yes airlines are made for alien's that weight 60 pounds and have short legs, not normal humans - but this neck pillow arrangement really helped me.  Now it is a larger kind of bag to carry but you can work it into attaching it to your carry on luggage.  Well worth the effort....."
"Enjoyed having this neck pillow with me on the plane. I was not as restless. Slept upright comfortably.  Other accessories were a bonus to the purchase which I have not used as yet."
"Spot on for job great price"
"Even though this is made by Tempur-Pedic, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this pillow to be THIS good! It has the classic ‚ÄúTempur-Pedic‚Äù feel, which I would rate it as a medium firm, and the zip off navy blue cover has a soft, velvety feel, so it looks more high end than typical orthopedic pillows. I think this would be helpful to use between the knees, or as a lumbar support, but I‚Äôm using this as a cervical support, so my review is focused on this purpose.For reference, I have cervical disc degeneration (spondylitis and stenosis, with herniated discs and bone spurs pressing on peripheral nerves), and have suffered from chronic Trigeminal Neuralgia (often referred to as the ‚Äúsuicide headache‚Äù because of its intensity), migraines, and radiculopathy pain/tingling/numbness in hands and arms, as a result of my cervical issues. I‚Äôm disabled and in constant pain, and cannot hold my head upright for more than 20-30 minutes without the nerve pain becoming much more intense. I have to wear a neck brace if I‚Äôm driving, prepping meals or folding laundry, etc. So, using right pillow has been critical for my health and well-being.My old memory foam neck pillow (not sure of the brand) had finally lost its ability to hold shape after 15 or so years. I have a Tempur-Pedic adjustable bed, and absolutely love how it feels, so that‚Äôs was willing to give this one a try. And even though other memory foam pillows were less expensive, from my experience, memory foam isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits all product‚Äî it can be softer, or firmer, depending on the type or the manufacturer, and some kinds of foam have terrible off-gassing odors, or tend to flatten after a short time. This is the 11th or 12th memory foam pillow I‚Äôve purchased in the last 20 years to help with my neck, so I figured this time, I‚Äôd  rather spend a little more on a Tempur-Pedic brand product, and ‚Äúbuy it once, buy it right.‚ÄùThis is definitely the ‚Äúgoooooood‚Äù kind of memory foam! It‚Äôs incredibly supportive, but still soft to the touch. And for those who say it‚Äôs too firm or too hard‚Äî I suggest that when you receive a memory foam product in the mail, you should always allow several hours for the item to acclimate to the temperature of the room (or in this case, perhaps you could try sitting on it for 20-30 minutes) before deciding that the product is too firm. And give the pillow a chance to adjust to the warmth of your body, as well. Temperature makes a huge difference!Since I ordered this in the winter, after initially opening the package, the pillow did feel quite firm (almost as firm as a tennis ball), but within an hour or so, it felt perfect! I was able to sleep all night long with just this pillow providing cervical support (for reference, I am a 5‚Äô8‚Äù average sized woman), without even using my regular contoured (not Tempur-Pedic)  memory foam pillow. It was heaven! I‚Äôve never been able to sleep at night just using a cervical pillow, so I‚Äôm blown away!The peanut shape allows for so much flexibility of use‚Äî I can nest my neck in the ‚Äúdip‚Äù of the center, or can shift it so that the larger end of the pillow presses against the base of my skull, which feels incredible! It‚Äôs comfortable in both a supine and side lying positions, and since I‚Äôll be using it while sleeping on my side, I decided to tuck it into a pillowcase during nighttime use, just so I won‚Äôt need to worry about removing zip off cover to wash it quite as often. While reclining and reading in bed, I can pair it with my regular memory foam pillow, so it‚Äôs nice to have something that provides this much support and flexibility of use. Since receiving it, I have been using it while relaxing on the couch, while in bed, everywhere I can! I wish I just could walk around with it all day long- it feels THAT good! I‚Äôll update my review if anything changes, or if the pillow doesn‚Äôt seem to hold up over time.I paid full price for this product, and have not received any compensation or other consideration for this review. I find reviews to be incredibly helpful to me when our items online, so that‚Äôs why I like to take a moment to write reviews for products I purchase. I hope you have found this review to be helpful!TL;DR‚Äî This pillow provides the PERFECT support, the zip off cover is luxurious and washable, and the hanging loop will be handy for travel. It‚Äôs a Tempur-Pedic, so you can‚Äôt go wrong!"
"If you have neck problems and benefit from relaxed neck traction at night, this is great. I use a firm foam pillow with two humps normally, but for traveling, this does the job. It's about a foot long, does NOT feel like a brick (you can easily squeeze it with your non dominant hand). It's perfect! Firm, ergonomic, portable. Great for portable chronic neck pain relief."
"This peanut pillow is perfect in every way! It is just the right size, not too big, not too small. It provides exactly the right amount of support for my neck. The cover is soft and comfortable on my skin. I bought it to use at the dentist as the chair hurts my neck but I use it every day at home too. It is a little expensive but is well made and worth every penny that I paid for it. I love this little pillow!"
"Had it for about 3 months now and my wife and I both use it all the time. Me for my neck and her for her back. On the couch and in the car. Still in great shape and a great balance between squishy and firm, even after all this use. Did need a small break in period at first where it was a little stiff."
"I ordered the Tempur-pedic pillow to support my lower back on chairs and in my vehicle. It works well at preventing back pain as it's very supportive but not at all stiff like others I've used in the past. Soft cover with a velvety feel is a bonus"
"It seems really well made & perfect for travel, but it was just too big around for my neck. I'm a slight-framed woman, 5'5"". Wish it came in a smaller diameter."
"love this P pillow! also, discovered that I prefer using it without the blue suede covering which compresses the memory foam a bit which makes it feel a bit harder and less comfortable. So I place only the foam portion into a pillow case (to keep it clean) and then use it and it feels so muck more comfortable, like a caress! try it f it feels a bit too hard."
"I‚Äôm making an exception in the case of this product!It‚Äôs excellent! It hits a home run in all the categories listed and let me just add, it‚Äôs not to firm!  It‚Äôs absolute perfection in that category as well! If you are thinking about buying something to use as neck support while sitting in your recliner watching TV and relaxing, look no further!  This is it! It‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for!I thought awhile before pulling the trigger on this purchase, because it‚Äôs a little pricey‚Ä¶. Then I thought‚Ä¶. You know what, if the reviews are even close to what they say about this product‚Ä¶. So, I bought one. It was delivered on time ( same day ) no delays no problems . It was packaged professionally, you could tell it was new and fresh because it smelled clean, looked clean and came in a zippered container that kept it that way for the customer. If I had a little money, and could invest in the company that owns this product, I would not hesitate to buy stock. The product is that good!  I‚Äôve had the product less than 24 hours, but used it the entire time for my neck support in my recliner. I haven‚Äôt, nor can I sleep in a traditional bed, I‚Äôm handicapped due to a car wreck which has prevented me from sleeping flat on my back for many years now. I have to have an adjustable incline in order to sleep, a recliner has been my bed for 40+ years now and I have tried countless other pillows, to no avail. This one is THE CORRECT PILLOW!  Buy it! I guarantee you will find it perfect! I‚Äôm just a citizen of the USA, I paid $40.00 for this product, just like you will if you decide to try one. I‚Äôm not affiliated with the company nor have I been compensated for this review."
"All Purpose Tempur-Pedic Pillow - Peanut Shape, size, small. It supports the neck really well. I‚Äôve used while sittting in a chair, sleeping in bed and for me it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôll be testing it on a road trip and an air flight, keep you posted. I do own other Tempur Pedic pillows and they do take some time for you body to adjust and when it does you‚Äôll never use another brand of pillow."
"Love the shape and how huggable it is!It is so easy to pack and bring it in short trips, or even as a lumbar support in road trips!"
"*This is a HONEST review from a real buyer! I read reviews about everything before purchasing and I often feel mislead.. I hope that my review can help someone else who may be having the same issues or sleep in the same strange position as I do*After suffering a neck and shoulder injury in early January I've spent the whole year and a ton of money searching for and testing anything and everything to provide even the slightest bit of relief. Finally my search has ended thanks to this pillow!I am an avid side sleeper and although medium to hard pillows are recommended, my whole life I have gotten away with the big soft fluffy pillows with no problems at all, that is until my injury. On my 2022 pillow hunt journey I've tried pillows made of all different things, shapes and sizes and each one seemed to be worse than the last and almost all of them (although the claim to be medium) are so hard I swear you can knock someone out with it.The Sidney pillow was one of the first to go in my cart but I kept putting it off due to some of bad reviews I read (particularly the chemical burn ones) and ended up going for more expensive pillows.HUGE MISTAKE!Finally I was in such extreme pain, sleep deprived, desperate and seen this pillow could arrive that night so ordered it and ordered 2 other kinds of pillows as well just incase.. Sidney pillow showed up around 4 am I immediately took it out of the package threw my own pillow case over it and tried laying on it right away before it fully expanded. There was a slight smell but I didn't care I had no patience and I just wanted sleep. After a few minutes I decided to add more stuffing (because it had not yet expanded fully) and layed back down and FINALLY got some sleep. When I woke up I did remove some of the stuffing and put it back in the bag and left the pillow to lay out with both the cover it comes with and my own off for the remainder of the day and occasionally fluffing it. By bedtime the smell was gone and it took just a little fluffing to get it how I wanted it and then I drifted off to the land of nod.The sidney pillow is what I would consider a ""medium"" pillow. Not so hard you feel like your laying on a rock but not so soft you have no neck support and falling into it. The slight curve in the pillow may not look as though it would make that big of a difference. I personally underestimated the curve lol. Now I can't imagine using a pillow without that curve. Ive tried many contour pillows but they are always so hard and they dont properly support the curve of my neck as they are to high and seem to be more for back sleepers. I never sleep with my pillow laying horizontally..  I like to sleep on my right side with my right arm upwards and underneath my pillow and kinda hug it. Normally this makes me need two pillows one to hug and another to lay my head on but that needs constant adjustment as I move or there are L or J shapped pillows but those do not provide enough pillow to hug on the longer leg side of it plus they take up a lot of space in bed.  So if you sleep like me, the curve with the Sidney Pillow allows you to perfectly form around it and the pointed corner ends wraps under your neck and head and around your shoulder giving the extra support normal rectangular pillows do not.After the first time sleeping on it I already felt less neck pain when waking up. After 3 days zero neck pain or shoulder pain upon waking up. Of course as the day goes on depending what I'm doing the pain starts to creep back up on me but with the help of this pillow I'm easily and comfortably able to get to sleep each night.  No more tossing and turning all night, no smell after airing the pillow out and allowing it to expand properly and no chemical burn which was my biggest fear cause I have super sensitive skin. I do not feel the cubes of stuffing as others said through the pillow case when I lay on it or even by running my hand over it. The cubes are very tiny and in no way jabbing at your face lol. It does take a little fluffing at first but I have not needed to constantly fluff it or had issues with it losing its shape. In fact the longer I've used it the better it has gotten as it has molded perfectly to me and my bodies natural curves and where I need the support.I know going off others reviews is difficult when it comes to pillows because everyone is different and sleeps differently but I truly think this pillow could be the one for just about anyone as it's easily adjustable to your liking of firmness and it molds to you and your body and sleeping position rather than the permanent pre cut and shaped you see with other pillows.I definitely recommend this pillow just be sure to remove the pillow case it comes with and allow it to air out and occasionally fluffing it during this process to release the fumes and help it expand properly. You may want to play around with the amount of stuffing you want in it to find what is best for you but don't lose patience if the first night it's not perfect because the more you sleep on it the more it will form to you and your curves. It truly becomes a pillow that seems as if it was molded just for you. I also don't recommend using it as a pillow you lean against in bed when sitting up reading or watching tv because that will change the form it has built for your individual neck, head, and shoulders."
"My husband bought this pillow recently because he’s a side sleeper and always wakes up with a sore neck with the regular pillows we’ve had. He figured he would try this one out. Since he’s been using it his neck doesn’t hurt when he wakes up!! He was telling me how comfortable it is and how it’s helped so much with his neck pain. So i thought I’d try it out as I’m a side sleeper as well, with back issues. I took a long nap with it and discovered that it’s the most comfortable pillow I’ve ever slept on. I immediately purchased one for myself and I’ve been sleeping great ever since!! My sleep is so much better with this pillow. Regular pillows would kind of go flat in the middle where my head rests and the sides be puffier. I would toss and turn. Now i sleep so much better and I’m not waking up as much. The pillows come with a very soft outer case and they even include a bag of extra stuffing! The pillows maintain a comfortable temperature.  I would rate this 10 stars if i could!! The best $32 I’ve ever spent!!"
"This is a queen size pillow and requires a queen size case; a normal case will not fit. This pillow has no smell whatsoever. The extra filling is nice but not needed. You will need to take filling out. I took out what seemed like gallons of filler and the pillow is still super puffy and hard to sleep on. This is a great pillow to prop your head on to watch TV but sleeping on it so far for me hasn't been enjoyable. The texture of the pillow is fine, the pillow is just too thick no matter how much filler I take out of it."
"Due to multiple cervical spine surgeries and cpap, it’s been difficult to find a pillow for my needs. This pillow fits the bill!  It is both supportive and comfortable, allowing me much more restful sleep every night. It is an ideal pillow for us special needs folks and I’m so happy to give it a thumbs up!"
"The firmness of the pillow is a bit off. Yes you can adjust by adding more foam which is provided or remove foam. The problem though is the foam naturally gets pushed to the back of the pillow and stops supporting the neck. Now I can add more foam but now I have a pillow that’s to big and poofy. As I move around it doesn’t adjust well and I just wake up with a stiff neck.If you want a super soft pillow poofy pillow then you’re golden.How I fixed my problem:I have a foam filled body pillow that has firm foam cubes as filling. I had a bunch of extra that I saved in a bag from when I removed some from it to suit my needs.I mixed the super soft foam with the firm foam about 30:70 with the majority firm and I had a great night sleep. I didn’t want to give up on the pillow cause it is really nice shape and materials. If this pillow had come with firmer foam or an extra foam that was more firm I’d be giving this a 5 star review."
"I've spent so time researching pillows I needed something that wouldn't leave me stiff,  sore with a headache in the morning. I spent a bunch of money trying different ones out. Then I found this pillow. The shape was a bit off putting. But I'm so glad I gave this one a try Like others have said in their reviews, there was an order at first. I washed the cover with my favorite softener and aired the pillow out for 24 hours before using it.  I love that it comes with a bag of extra stuffing and another bag for excess stuffing. The first few nights I didn't add or remove any stuffing and it was pretty comfy. But the 4th night I removed a bit of the stuffing and it was heaven.  I haven't had any more morning headaches, stiffness or soreness  I recommend this pillow for people with neck problems."
"To anyone who gets a sore neck this is the perfect pillow to solve that problem. It's perfect but very expensive!"
"I was having pretty severe neck and shoulder pain, this pillow helped alleviate the pain considerably, its not all gone but definitely a big help!I like that you have the abiility to adjust the filling as needed. My head and neck are supported very well by this pillow."
"But sadly it didn’t work for me"
"It was a big treat to invest in a pillow I was a bit doubtful it would help me sleep but it's worth investing in from my perspectiveIt takes a little while to have the right volum of memory foam for you personally but once you find the right amount it's great. It's slightly strange having a pillow this shape and it's easy not to put your head properly on it so resting the crown rather than whole side of head but you'll know because your just nit as comfy as you should be so pull it down securely under your head and although you know your heads on something but alchmy happens as once your resting on it youve not much time to think because your fast asleep which for insomniac me is great.You don't need to search for the right shape pillow case as I did but use a regular pillowcase it doesn't detract from the pillowYou get a nice back with lots of extra memory foam so you'll be able to use as much or as little as suits you bestI found using a bit more than I expected to need was best for meI would recommend this pillow"
"As an chronic insomniac with apnea  as well, I sleep in a chair -- choking is, one might say, ""not fun.""  Suffice to say, I've tried may such neck pillows and this one beats the all the rest for ease of use and comfort.Unlike the others, this one retains it's fluff best, the pillow can be removed to clean the carrier."
"Perfect size and softness, very comfortable.  I love the fact that you can use it straight or curved unlike other brands.  Very happy with this."
"I have tried several other neck pillow which ended up hurting the back of my neck because they were too hard and not adjustable. This one is adjustable and I just love it for using on my recliner at night to watch TV. I would highly recommend it! (UPDATE): After using this neck pillow for a few months, I still like it but it has flattened out quite a bit and now It is not as supportive as when it was new. I wish I could get some replacement microbeads to add to it. Otherwise I still like it."
"I have 3 fused cervical vertebrae and this pillow is a real game changer for travel and positioning.  The microbes are easy to move to either flatten out or plump up and area for maximal neck comfort allowing both side lying and supine sleeping.  The pillow also is flexible enough to wrap around your neck for support in travel either while riding in a car or in flight.  Great pillow for the money"
"bought this in anticipation of long plane flights when I'd be falling asleep. Found that pillow just pushed my neck forward into an awkward position. Nicely made,  but not good for me."
"I bought a memory foam, straight cylinder-style, neck pillow (with the bamboo cover), and it was just too firm. While laying on my back in bed with it under my neck, it jutted my neck out too far and my head back. I'd use it for maybe 20 minutes a night, and my neck pain got noticeably worse after 2 weeks. This microbead is much better. It's much looser/floppier, and you can push the beads to be more dense or less dense under your neck as feels comfortable. And the longer length and very long strap on this one allows you use it in loose or tight U-shape if you want. I found a medium U-shape also gave my head some side-to-side support while I was using it. Plus this microbead gave a nice warming feel. I'm not a back sleeper at all, and I actually found myself dozing off a little with this one. I highly recommend this microbead over any memory foam for neck while lying down on back."
"I thought Samsonite was a reliable manufacturer, but I've changed my mind based on this product.  It preformed as expected for about three months, then the filler began migrating within the ever-expanding fabrics they used.  I've removed the outer cover, tried to gauge how much fabric would return the product to it's original support, and tied a knot in it to limit the size, but no go.  The fabric keeps expanding, and I have to keep retying the knot.What's up with your quality, Samsonite?  Whichever department chose, then tested? this product either failed and lied to you, or, you accepted not one, but two fabrics that are dysfunctional for the item (both inner and outer covers over-stretch).I'll not trust the Samsonite name again (no matter the price), because this product should never have left your production building with your company name on it.Fool me once..."
"Adjustable as its long and squishy not molded into a ring. I have a lot of arthritis in my neck and this works well for neck support without pushing my neck forward out of alignment. Removable cover is important to me for washing. I would air dry it though."
"I've had a couple of neck pillows in the past (mainly to use when flying) and found that they were too big/uncomfortable for me. I'm small in stature (4'10"") so the thickness of many neck pillows are just too big and I wind up with a sore neck when I get home. Took this one recently on a couple of 5-hr flights, and it was perfect. This one is very malleable, you can adjust the pillow's thickness the way you want to suit your needs. And the clip on the pillow makes it easy to tote as well...I attached mine to my purse straps so I wouldn't have to physically carry it through the airport. Very comfortable, a great purchase!(Only drawback I had with it....when I finally arrived home and put my purse on the living room floor, my over-excitable border collie spotted the pillow - still attached to purse - and thought he'd lucked out with a new stuffy toy, purchased just for him, and he began attempting to pry it loose. I had to persuade my semi-spoiled companion that no, the neck pillow was not for him. But for the few moments he had it, he loved it.)"
"This is the best neck pillow for stuffing with your extra clothes for traveling with carry on, it's a strong zick, sturdy but soft fabric and still super comfy to sleep on, plus filled with clothes it's basically a weighted pillow, buy, you won't regret!"
"The item is soft and flexible. Very comfortable fit around the neck. Great buy!"
"The pillow is a snug fit and with Velcro’s to adjust can be flexible."
"Well, I'm a hard worker. I often get lost in my creative zone in the study and stay seated for hours. Soon, my neck and shoulders “protest”.My wife always tells me to take a break and nap on the desk when I'm tired.😜This grey, oval-shaped travel pillow stuffed with memory foam came along at the right time. I gave it a shot, and it was surprisingly comfy! Whenever I hit a writing snag and my neck felt as stiff as a board, I'd simply lean back on it.😁It provided just the right support for my neck, with a great bounce-back quality. The velcro was a nifty addition, making it super easy to adjust the tightness so it fit snugly around my neck.😳I didn't limit its use to the study either. There were times when I was half-lying on the lazy sofa in the living room, using it too.Sure, when I woke up, my neck felt a bit strange at first, but there was no denying it was way softer than those U-shaped pillows.It was ideal for leaning over the desk and grabbing a short nap during breaks. Over time, it's truly become my trusty sidekick on workdays, always there to make those long hours of work a bit more bearable."
"I ordered this neck travel pillow from Amazon Vine because to take with me when I travel to see if it could make me feel a little bit more comfortable when I am flying. From the moment I unrolled it from its compact travel bag, I could tell it was designed to be practical and easy to use. The memory foam inside felt just the right amount of firm and soft, and it bounced back into shape after I squeezed it, which made me feel like it would hold up well during the flight.When I actually used it on the plane, it gave my neck more support than the usual U-shaped pillows I have tried in the past. I really liked that my head didn’t fall forward, and I wasn’t shifting around as much to find a good position to rest. It felt snug, but not too tight, and it has a breathable fabric that kept me from feeling too hot or uncomfortable, even when I wore it for a while.Plus, the cover is removable and washable so I can keep my neck pillow clean after traveling and using it for several hours. Another thing I appreciated was how easily it rolled back up and fit into the small bag, so it didn’t take up much room in my carry-on. It is simple and effective, and it made my journey more bearable without being bulky or difficult to pack away. Therefore, I am quite happy with this neck travel pillow."
"Great neck support if you don't have anywhere to lean to fall asleep. I wish I'd had it for the last 3 long flights prior. I will use it even in a window seat. In the car as a passenger. I have fibromyalgia, and suffer chronic neck and back pain 24/7, so this product is an absolute godsend. I might be giving them for Christmas gifts this year, as I lent it to my son and his girlfriend to take on their flight to Hawaii, and they both said it was amazing. It also comes with its own little carrying case that is small enough to fit in your carry on or backpack."
"This travel pillow is my absolute travel piece!  I was on a 32-hour flight and brought this pillow, which saved my neck!  This pillow is comfortable, and cozy,  and provides good support on long flights.  This 100% pure Memory foam is made to fit around my neck and head, providing me a 360-degree support to keep my neck relaxed without feeling so stiff or tense..  I especially appreciate its breathability - it doesn't overheat even after a few hours of use.  I recommend it to anyone who travels!"
"I love these small neck pillows because it’s great for when you are traveling or even if you need it on your long waits for appointments or other occasions. It wraps around your neck nicely and tight and prevents your head from falling, It supports your neck from neck pains, and it makes your sleep more comfortable, love it, I have it in my car when I need!"
"I expected to receive this pillow in a big package, however, surprising me, it came in a small bag, really convenient to carry it while traveling. This travel pillow offers exceptional relief for those who suffer from shoulder, back and neck pain, especially during long rides in vehicles or airplanes. Its ergonomic design provides excellent support, significantly reducing shoulder and back pain. The memory foam filling is both comfortable and durable, with adjustable Velcro, molding perfectly to your neck for personalized support. Beyond travel, it’s incredibly comfortable to use at home, whether you're watching TV or sitting at the computer. Its breathable, washable cover keeps it fresh and easy to maintain, making it a reliable companion for comfort and pain relief both at home and on the go."
"I recently used this travel pillow on my trip, and it felt pretty soft and comfortable, providing support all around my neck. It’s compact when stored, taking up very little space, making it perfect for travel. Unlike my previous inflatable memory pillow, there’s no need to inflate or deflate it, which was not easy to use. Plus, it’s machine washable, easy to clean. It really helps alleviate fatigue during my journey."
"I bought this for my dog and she loves it! It is so soft, compact, and comfortable that Iâ€™ve been using it as a couch pillow and my husband is using it to ease pain on his shoulder at night.Nice pillow, nice size"
"These are worth the money. They are fully stuffed, but soft and comfortable.  Very nice product. I like them very much.The directions say they are machine washable and dryable. I have not done that yet."
"Perfect size, soft, and the bonus of per knee vs a bolster pillow is when rolling on my side"
"These pillows are the size I was wanting but they are a little too soft and flat.  I was hoping for a little fatter pillow.  I use them to lean on when I sleep for my back.  They work but not as well as I would have liked."
"These little pillows met my expectations and then some.  I wanted a small pillow to replace an old one that I had been using for a long time for an extra support while reading in bed.  They are soft and yet have a generous polyester fill.  I washed them before I used them and they washed and dried (in the drier) beautifully. I did use two tennis balls in the drier with them to keep the fill from lumping. They seem to be well made and I am pleased with my purchase."
"Perfect size to put behind head while reclining. Nice firmness."
"Pillows are kind of flat with no recovery. You have to fluff them up and they go flat again rather quickly."
"These worked great and weâ€™re very comfortable. I put two in a pillowcase and it worked out great."
"I love how lightweight and neatly this packs.I am going on an international trip, but I didn't want a lot of extra bulk, so I wanted to get a travel pillow that was inflatable, would be easy to pack in my personal item bag for the plane, and I could stow while moving from terminal to terminal in airports. I also plan to use it while our tour group is traveling from place to place on buses.I love how quickly this inflates and deflates. The inflate/deflate valve has two fittings, which allow for adjusting the ""softness"" of the pillow easily, without entirely deflating the pillow. The plastic inside the fabric seems flimsy, but it has to be thin in order for the pillow to pack so neatly into its credit card-sized carrying case. The fabric on the outside of the pillow is soft, luxurious, and will be comfortable to sleep on.It is pricey, but I think it is well-made and will be perfect for my trip. I'll come back and adjust my review if I have any issues."
"These pack up nicely, super light weight, and nice and comfortable. Adjustable inflation is fantastic, and the pressure valve built into these is very easy to use."
"In preparation for an abroad trip with my mom, I did ALOT of research on neck pillows. I read several reviews and decided to try out the top 4 I found.I tried both versions of BCOZZY and I would probably rank them second best although still not something to get a great night sleep with, let alone the bag that it folds up into is still rather bulky.I also tried the Sea to Summit Aeros Premium Inflatable Travel Pillow, which wasn’t bad but definitely wasn’t designed to be using in a reclining chair. It probably would’ve worked fine for a sleeping bag though. I ended up ranking it third on my list just because it would move around when I tried to sleep in the recliner with it testing it out.I also tried the TRTL pillow which based upon the reviews and the price I thought would be great…well it wasn’t. You can only sleep with your head leaning one way and if you don’t have the “plastic support” piece in the right position it’s uncomfortable. Needless to say this one got ranked #4 (worst).Now on to this lovely green pillow…First it’s inflatable which means it takes up less space when not in use. Secondly you can inflate and deflate to whatever amount of pressure you want in your pillow to make it extra comfortable for you. It doesn’t matter if you change sleeping from left to right as it still has support on both sides. It also has a lovely snap so that you can keep the front two ends together (definitely recommend using it). My personal tip is to use the pillow with it turned around in case you nod going forward. It still has enough pillow for sleeping left or right when you do this.I originally bought this solely for an abroad trip, but honestly it’s so comfortable that I’ve used it to take naps in the recliner at home as well as car rides. It honestly is worth every penny!"
"I have purchased two of these pillows for every-night use. They work well, and I think they would work well as an airplane neck support on a flight. However, for my every-night use, I have to add air every day. 8 hours after filling to firm pressure, the pillow is mushy once again."
"I was looking to replace an old, standard travel pillow and am so glad I saw the recommendations for this one on Reddit. Not only is this pillow compact (the case is the size of 2 Airpod cases), I was taken aback by how light this is and soft the material is. I was nervous about the inflation process, but it genuinely only takes 3 puffs and it’s full. The strap is definitely needed, to keep the pillow secure, and I saw one reviewer say theirs ripped off: I can see why this may have happened, it’s definitely lighter weight to achieve the overall lightness in the design, but I can’t imagine it’d break unless you’re tugging at it to come unbuttoned. If you simply unbutton, I don’t see this pillow coming apart anytime soon."
"I don't expect miracles from my travel pillow so I'm happy with this one. I like that I can adjust how firm it is. I also find it comfortable in various positions (""frontwards"" or on the side).  It inflates and deflates quickly. I didn't want one more thing to haul around so I love that I can squish this down into a little case and throw it in my carry on. I recommend this product."
"Comfortable, well made, compacts down well. Perhaps a little expensice for what it is but not egregious"
"Their products are the best! This was so comfy. You can easy blow it up and adjust the amount of air on it. So small and convenient to carry w you. No moreCarrying a kind that moon shaped pillow!!!"
"Bought this for long haul flight to Australia-great support to help you sleep in any position.Only criticism is its very hard to do the straps up behind your neck for optimum support hence 4 stars."
"I like the softness,  but it makes a sound sort of like a crunch from a plastic bag. It is virtually identicle to the Eagle Creek Exhale Pillow, but the Eagle Creek one is a lot cheaper. I won't return this, as the Covid crisis is ongoing,  and it really isn't fair to the people of Amazon to return it, but I'm sorry I bought it."
"My first sea to summit product. I tried it out at home. It is so comfortable and packable. Looking forward to using it on my trip."
"I’ve probably tried out eight different travel pillows over the years, everything from the beanbag type that is shaped like a doughnut to the thing that looks like a scarf to hold your head up, to traditional travel pillows, and everything in between. And this pillow got it right, it took the best from every different type of pillow and put it into one. It looks exactly like the pictures and performs as expected. Why it’s awesome: first is the obvious, it keeps your head from flopping forward and waking you up because The pillow itself attaches to the headrest of the airplane seat. And because the front of the pillow has a cinch string, which makes it possible to close the pillow completely around your neck and cradles your jaw/chin, it actually keeps your head from flapping forward if you make it tight. But the pillow and the fabric are firm but soft so it’s not uncomfortable when the pillow is tight. I think the height of the pillow is perfect regardless of how short or long a neck you have because the pillow is plush and can accommodate. The pillow cradles your head on all four sides it also keeps your head from tilting to the side too much. There is padding on the back of the pillow, but not too much, so it would be comfortable to use even if you didn’t end up attaching it to a headrest (I used it in bed lol). it comes with a great travel bag that compresses it a bit for easy traveling. I like attaching a carabiner to the bag strap so that I can easily attach it to the outside of my suitcase or backpack. I haven’t tried washing the exterior yet, supposedly it comes off, but one reviewer said that did not end well. TBD on that."
"I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the comfort and convenience of the Evolution S3 Travel Neck Pillow by Cabeau, and it has completely transformed the way I travel. This neck pillow is the epitome of comfort on-the-go and has become an essential companion for my journeys.Memory Foam Bliss: The memory foam used in this neck pillow is a game-changer. It cradles my neck and head in the most comfortable and supportive way possible, making long journeys a breeze. It provides the perfect balance of plushness and firmness, ensuring that I can rest my head without any discomfort.Adjustable Clasp and Seat Strap Attachment: The adjustable clasp not only keeps the pillow securely in place but also allows for a customized fit. No more slipping or readjusting during the entire trip. The seat strap attachment is a brilliant feature, ensuring that the pillow stays exactly where I need it, whether I'm on an airplane, train, or in the car.Portable and Compact: The carrying case that comes with the pillow is a thoughtful addition. It allows me to easily pack the neck pillow in my carry-on or backpack without taking up much space. It's incredibly convenient and keeps the pillow clean and ready for use.Versatile Travel Companion: Whether it's a long-haul flight, a road trip, or even a quick nap on a train, the Evolution S3 Travel Neck Pillow excels in all situations. It provides the comfort and support I need to arrive at my destination feeling refreshed, not fatigued.Quality and Durability: The build quality of this neck pillow is top-notch. It feels durable and built to last, which is reassuring for frequent travelers like myself. I appreciate the attention to detail and the use of quality materials.The Cabeau Evolution S3 Travel Neck Pillow is a true gem for travelers. Its memory foam comfort, adjustable clasp, seat strap attachment, and portability make it a top-tier travel accessory. It's clear that Cabeau has put a lot of thought into designing a product that addresses the needs and comforts of travelers. Whether you're embarking on a long journey or just need some extra neck support for a quick nap, this neck pillow is the ultimate solution. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a 5-star travel experience."
"We're taking an 11 hour transpacific flight later this year, so we're looking for neck pillows that will keep our heads from flopping when sleeping in economy seats.I've been testing it out while sitting in a chaise lounge, trying to simulate an airline seat. The foam is a perfect density: soft but supportive. It seems to be very well made.I like that it has a case that you can compress it into (and that it warns you not to store it compressed for more than a month). It gets warm, but that can be good or bad.The product has a noticeable scent, kind of like a lemony cleaning product. I hope this dissipates or can be eliminated by laundering the cover.The model (person) shown on the product packaging must have a very long neck, because the pillow doesn’t even touch her ears! I'm 5'4"" tall, and the sides of the pillow are so high that they cover the lower half of my ears. That said, maybe the height of the sides will prove to be a positive for me. Some people might find the pressure on their ears or the warmth around their neck uncomfortable.My husband (5'10"") will try it next to see how it feels for him. At the steep price for these pillows, I don't want to buy a second one unless I'm sure."
"I wanted a pillow that would hold my head upright instead of flopping on a recent trip to Europe for the long, long flight across the ocean. This was super simple to use, held my head upright preventing neck pain, and was very comfortable to sleep with. I got one for me and my wife and we both had a really great experience with these. I don't usually leave reviews, but I was impressed with the quality and functionality so much that I feel it warrants the review.Bonus points that the guy in the seat next to me sets up travel for companies that do President's club trips and travels extensively internationally on long flights and he had the same one and gave a big two thumbs up review about it too. Additionally, I saw several clipped to people's backpacks while navigating airports during this trip. These seem to be the real deal and well-loved and used by many!"
"Very comfortable and good neck support for long flights. The back is almost square so it rests comfortably against the seat.Only negative is that it doesn’t fold down so it’s a bit bulky in the carry on. Recommend and I would purchase again"
"Having recently traveled through Africa, I had nearly 50 hours of flying in a span of 3 weeks! Knowing this was coming up, I decided to upgrade my airplane pillow and settled on the Cabeau. Thankfully, I was not disappointed!I'll keep this very simple; see below for the Pros, Cons & Conclusion:Pros:- Comfortable (probably the best I've used)- Doesn't budge- Didn't smell- Packs nicely- Allows you to ""lean"" into it; if you're a side sleeper like myself, this helps.Cons:- There is really only 1 con, and that's how it works with headphones. Unfortunately, there's no way to cut it; this doesn't work well with headphones. Tiny earbuds, yes, but headphones rub along the side and push the headphones up. I had to switch to earbuds numerous times because the headphones wouldn't fit properly/Conclusion:  This is the best airplane pillow I have had the pleasure of using. If you have upcoming travel & want to upgrade your in-flight comfort, look no further. However, if you are someone who relies on bulky headphones during you're flight, you may want to consider another option."
"This pillow is very comfortable and a great size. It would be perfect for traveling purposes in more ways than one. It goes in the bag easily for carrying and great size for in a car. I laid on it to try it out, but I bought it to use as a between my legs while sleeping pillow and it's perfect for my purpose. I hate the weird knee pillows and regular pillows are too big."
"Only used these in a hotel experience so far but purchased them for a primitive camping trip to Alaska. So far they have held up and are very comfortable. The size is perfect for travel and the carry case is fabulous. I added some rubberbands to help hold it's shape while getting it back into the travel bag. Perfect size to attach to my backpack for travel."
"I would have given this 5 stars if there had actually been a carrying bag included, as stated in the product description.  Firmness is perfect for my needs.  Works well as a leg pillow and small yet firm enough for a travel pillow."
"I bought these for the camped build I made for the back of my truck and they are perfect. I have slept a few nights with them now and this pillow is comfortable. I wish it was a little thicker but its fine. They roll us to a nice size, probably twice the width of a nalgene bottle and 2 inches taller. I also wish it came with a pillow case. Great pillow though."
"I took this on a recent trip.  I sat on it during the plane ride.  I used it as a regular pillow when the hotel pillows were not comfortable.  It is the BEST travelling companion!"
"I like this pillow...hoping I can break it in...because it's so hard that it hurts the cartilage in my ears. Its a love hate relationship. The size is great! I had been using a small travel pullow for every night sleeping. This one fits into my standard pillow cases. Thickness is perfect. Quality is great."
"So easy and lightweight to travel with and to pack!!!"
"I LOVE this pillow, it is medium firm, and not too thin, but not too thick. I really dislike extra thick pillows so this is the perfect thickness and firmness. It supportive enough, but soft! I ditched my neck pillow and amused this one instead on my trip to Italy. I traveled for 11 days and I even used it instead of the hotel pillows and it has become my favorite pillow..even replacing my one that I used at home! I need them to make a full size version of this!!"
"You will definitely feel you got more than you paid for. HUGE bag, well made. My son uses this as his hockey bad for his hockey skates and gear with lots of room left over. The bad doesn't have a cardboard bottom to give it a structure as a lot of bags have but for the price it's been very good for our purposes. Definitely recommend this bag if you need a big bag."
"We flew on Avelo and they have specific dimensions for a checked bag, not only did the Dimensions nail it, but it fit about 54 pounds of clothes, we just brought a smaller carry-on to take out the extra when we were at their scale and it was perfect. You definitely need a person with muscles to carry it from the car to check it onto the airplane though because this beast is heavy! Can’t beat the price either!"
"Very very very efficient for traveling. The bags hold A LOT and weighs less than a pound each. Don’t put share objects in the bag though as that will rip it. Great straps, great bag! Actually better than I expected."
"Big enough to carry my 4 man tent, ground cloth and more. I wish it was made of Cordura instead of thin nylon, but nylon is still pretty durable."
"This duffel is great.  Large capacity and seems to be well made.  It withstood being checked baggage on a flight with no issues.  The only thing I wish was different was that there were holes in the zipper handles to be able to clip them together to assure they would not slip open during the flight or handling."
"Needed another bag to check, this worked fine for excess clothes, laundry etc. Great price and can’t miss the red color coming off the baggage claim area."
"UPDATE June 2020: I had a mandatory medical trip I took and took along one of my duffels. I found out you CAN lock these duffels. I purchased a set of ""TSA approved Sure Locks"" that are the perfect size to fit in the zipper pull holes. You can find them on Amazon below:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G7V5M17/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_b4o9EbP8NM5ATUPDATE: I finally went on my trip.  I bought a total of four of these duffel bags, but ended up taking three, plus two smaller bags. So far, they traveled in a truck, 2 Ubers, 1 hotel shuttle, 2 airplanes, and thru baggage claim...and a yellow cab and they all made it to Mexico City all intact.  No rips, nada.  I'm impressed.  I've added more photos to show the bags in their original state packed.  They all weighed about 40lbs at the airport.  They were pretty much packed and I'm sure exceeded the checked baggage limit size based on my measurements, but I didn't have to pay any oversize fees at the Delta service desk.  They didn't even look at them twice.  Highly recommend these if for no other reason than a good bag to use for storage.Please note: I stored the shoulder straps of each bag in one of the outside zippered pockets.  That's when I discovered that the fabric (seat belt material) that is made out of the handles actually extends all the way to the bottom of the bag and is double stiched and taped and sewn with a separate piece of nylon, so those handles are hefty.  The whole time I thought they were just sewn to the side of the upper bag because that's all you can see from all the images.  But, when you unzip those exterior pockets you'll see the extra craftsmanship.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Wow!  Very roomy bags.  Upon opening the small boxes they came in, I had my doubts and they initially appeared to be just regular size duffel bags.  But, after I shook one open it expanded to a mega size.I purchased two of these to use as checked bags to transport a LOT of stuff I will need for a 9 month trip.  Mainly a lot of cosmetic bottles,  cleaning supplies, a heater, fan, slow cooker and a lot of other stuff.  I find that no matter where you go having your own cooker, personal fan and heater is necessary, because rooms are either too cold or hot.These bags aren't very cheaply made in my opinion (even though they are made in China).  I thought the nylon was stronger than expected and the zippers are too.All the hardware is metal, not plastic.  Can't wait to use these in 3 months.  I would recommend using bread bag ties to tie the two main zippers together, which is what I do with other pieces of luggage to prevent them separating in transit.Locking any soft sided luggage, in my opinion is a waste.  If someone wanted inside, they just penetrate the zippers or cut the fabric.  But, bread ties work great to lessen the chances of an accidental opening.I update many of my reviews and I will come back and give my 2cents on how they worked out in the wild.  But, there's no reason to give these bags nothing less than 5 stars.Note: I purchased the red color, and it's not fire engine red, but more burgany/maroon in color.  Which is a good thing.I added a photo to show how large these bags are.  I stacked both of mine on top of a Patagonia Black Hole Duffel 120L size.  Look how much bigger the Amazon bags are.  Those120L black hole duffel bags are huge.  People use them to go to Mt Everest base camp.  Hope this photo helps in comparing the size.Before I forget, the only thing I can see Amazon doing to make this bag even more awesome, is adding a shoulder pad to the strap.  I already have several extra pads from other bags that I plan to slide on these existing straps.  I will only be using the straps to move from a taxi to just inside the airport terminal to the checked baggage desk.  So not a biggie."
"This thing is big and it's light. I knew the size dimensions when I ordered it but I was still sort of shocked when I opened it up. It definitely will fit whatever you want to pack. With that in mind, I would only recommend this bag if you are the one handling your bag (i.e. traveling in an automobile). I don't think I'd trust baggage handlers with air travel.The strap is nice, the various pockets (a lot with zippers) are great, and the main zipper seems strong. If you want a very big bag at a very cost-effective price, this is a great option. There are definitely better products out there at much higher prices, but this one gets the job done and doesn't require breaking the bank. Basically, it's a great option to use if it's impractical to use or you don't want to use your traditional suitcase for certain travel or packing needs."
"I needed a big duffle bag that is lightweight and foldable to gather all different types of things that I needed for hospital admission. I didn’t expect much considering the price, but it really exceeded my expectations. It looks very decent, very durable and the materials don’t look cheap. The zippers also look and feels reliable and I love that it has a lot of small pockets. Very handy with this purchase."
"Like many reviews here said: it’s made of a great material. It’s big. The straps are strong and finishing are done nicely."

"Its big enough to fit my 54in fairly large tail and wings, hands and my head. All the extra pockets are great for accessories and a balaclava. It’s a bit flimsy but I fully intend to use solely for local travel. Plus it folding up into a smallish bag means I can clip it to my belt."

"Bag is decent I've really only used it once for a trip and have it stored in its folded compact form. It's very thin so don't expect a heavy duty bag. Lots of room and good price"
"This bag was everything I expected. It’s huge! The fabric is very light and thin but it does the job!! And a fantastic price!"

"Nice and big. Hold lots of stuff and has plenty of pockets. Has a waterproof pocket also. Durable and I love the color."
"I got this for travel.  I used it for a trip to CA.  I really like it.  It's roomier than it looks.  I like how well it fit under the seat in front of me, I still had room for my feet.  I was able to access cord for my phone,  my jacket and pillow easily in flight.  It has an internal wet pocket.  It was easy to carry around after my luggage was checked.  It has a strap/sleeve that fits easily over the handle of my carryon, rides nice on my carryon.  The quality seems good.  Wish it had a more heavy duty zipper but so far it hasn't been an issue.  I would buy this again."
"I absolutely love this bag. It holds more than I anticipated. It is sturdy, easy to clean, stores away easily when not in use. I live that it will ride on top of my suit case securely. Good quality."
"Pro- size. I bought this for a week trip, it was perfect size for flight travel! I was able to put a lot of stuff in here. Also has many pockets with zipper. Strong too. Good bag.Con - it feels heavy to carry and walk around. I expected it lighter since it’s fabric but it is feels heavy even when it’s empty due to waterproof material. But I love the size of bag so I kept it."

This bag is solid! The zipper seems fine, the fabric is durable, the waterproof pocket is great, the shoe storage on the bottom is amazing (holding all three pairs of shoes that I'm going to need on my trip). The trolly strap of your luggage handle is sturdy. The pocket to hold your boarding pass is wonderful. I do wish the very front pocket had a means of securing it, it'll work for a momentary place to set your phone, but I wouldn't keep it there for any length of time as it might either fall out or be snatched up by a slick pickpocket. I don't have any of the unfortunate issues that some have had. I ordered because of there being so few people with problems compared to the total number of bags purchased and high numbers of seriously happy customers. I figured with so many bags sold, there's bound to be a few with issues, but the odds of getting one with problems is low, and with Amazon's easy returns and exchanges, it was worth the risk. No other bag had 31,000+ reviews let alone high number of reviews and high rating. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"A great travel bag for the weekend or for the gym. It fits a lot, the color is great and the manufacturing is also"
"I bought this bag to put in my suitcase for any gifts and extras I might buy while on vacation. Instead, I used it to replace my backpack. It holds a LOT, has inside and outside pockets, is light weight and strong, has a shoulder strap and shorter carry handles. It has a trolley strap that was really convenient, too.  The price was less than half of the heavily advertised competitor, so I say this bag is a winner.  I'd buy another."
"Absolutely love this duffel bag. The spacious interior makes it perfect for a weekend getaway or a gym session. It’s stylish, durable and sturdy. Love that there is a wide range of colours to choose from and the feature where you could slip it into your carry on luggage."
"This bag is cute and Light. Nice for trips to the pool and park etc"
"Overall a very nice bag. I bought for a short business trip (3 days) and had plenty of space for everything. Looks good, has a lot of options for carrying and storage, reasonably priced and great for both the gym and short trips.-- Pros --* Flexibility (Carrying): This bag has a lot of options for both carrying. The backpack straps, shoulder strap and carrying handles were all used and appreciated (depending on how far I was walking or what else I was carrying. The straps all have compartments so they can be tucked away (see images).* Flexibility (Storage): There are a number of internal and external compartments, pouches, and a flex space which I used for dirty clothes. The flex space is particularly nice because it could be used as additional expansion if needed by flipping the lining outward (see pics). It's also great for keeping dirty items separate. The side zip pouches are nice to have but they are very small (more on that later).* Durability: Materials are all easy to clean, thick, and sturdy. The zippers are metal, move smoothly with no catching on lose fabric, and the ends sewn into the body so it is unlikely they will ever jump the track.* Appearance: Looks are subjective but I like the color of the light grey and the styling overall. In the listing the bag looks almost white but in person, the color is a bit darker (still a very, very light grey though).-- Cons --* Storage Space: As noted above, there are a lot of compartments. 6 exterior including- 4 side pouches that zip fully- 1 bottom pouch (when used as a backpack) that is adjustable in size and- 1 mesh stretch pouch on the top (when used as a backpack)The minor complaints I have are mainly that all of the zip pouches have very little space and don't stretch or expand much at all. You can't fit much more than some socks, deodorant (see pics), or a few cables/cords/chargers/etc.The mesh pouch on top (in backpack form) does not close or fasten in any way and when used as a backpack the opening is behind you and angled downward (see pics). This means it better be empty when you wear it as a backpack (otherwise it will be empty soon enough...).* Lose Stitching: More of a nit-pick here because overall the construction and quality is great but there were a few loose stiches here and there. Nothing major and easy to snip but one of them on the carrying strap didn't fully tie off so eventually it will unthread itself further. Easy fix for me and doesn't change my general satisfaction with the quality."
"This is exactly what I was expecting for the price and materials.  I really like its style and performance.  Iâ€™ve purchased a few other duffle bags looking for something like this but wasnâ€™t happy them until I came across this. The zipper is smooth, the materials feel well made, the pockets are roomy, and the colors pop.  I recommend this one if you want your moneys worth."
"So far it is working well. It is light & time will tell if it is durable. Pleany of room for my needs & enough pockets to separte logically."
"The bag has so much to offer besides the quality. The best part is the separate shoe area which keeps your shoes away from your clothes (and the smell). It has an air hole to help dry out your sweaty shoes if you work out that hard. Also, I used the top area with the stings to put my shower flip-flops in for the water to dry off quickly. Best gym bag ever!!!!!!"

I love this bag!It has so many pockets for small things, it's not to big and not small. It holds all my necessary equipment and i can add more if i need. Comfortable handle! And seems to be a good quality bag. I had it for about a month so far, carried 22lbs ankle weights and other things, looks like it's pretty sturdy as well.I didn't try it as a backpack so got nothing to say about that feature."
"The Gym Bag offers plenty of space for all your workout and travel essentials. The separate shoe compartment and anti-theft features are well-thought-out, adding convenience and security. Its water-resistant material is perfect for gym or travel use. Overall, a great bag that combines functionality with ample storage."
"Great bag with a lot of pockets for our personal belongings for camping each weekend.  Plenty of storage for bulky items in winter too and zipper seems of good quantity but will have some trips to prove itâ€™s strength.  Overall a good bag."
"Good quality with plenty of pockets. Priced fairly but seems a little small when you have the bag fully packed for the gym."
"Big and roomy, folds down compact. Durable material that will hold up and color perfect to picture."
"HAS WO MUCH ROOM, ZIPPER IS STURDY AND QUALITY, THE STYLE INCLUDES A PLACE TO PUT YOUR SHOES, AND PC AND CLOTHES ETC, STYLE IN ITSELF IS REALLY STURDY AND EASY TO CARRY WITH THE SHOULDER STRAP. I WALK ALL OVER DOWNTOWN AND IT HOLDS PERFECTLY. MANY COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM . REALLY DEPENDABLE PRODUCT!"
"This is a decent duffle for the price. It's a bit flimsy and the fabric is pretty thin, but if it lasts a couple years, I'll have gotten my money's worth. I ended up taking a hard flat plastic bottom piece from another duffle and put it in the bottom of this one to make it a bit sturdier, and that helped a lot.I like that it has a separate shoe compartment, although it could have been a bit bigger; my husbands size 12 shoes didn't quite fit, although I was able to squish 2 pair of my smaller sized shoes in there.I liked the variety of colors available and the bluish-green color I got looks nice. It's got lots of compartments for stowing all your stuff and a handy strap to hold it on your suitcase handle."
"Like how it goes down to nothing easy to store.  Lightweight."
"Even though I picked the larger size and should have gotten a size smaller it still worked out great for what I needed it for. I was able to put everything that I needed in it and still had room left over. The material is sturdy enough but isn't the sturdier material I thought it was going to be. It is a little thinner of material but still is a great bag."
"I received the bag about a month and a half ago, and all was well at first, i can’t complain about how much space it has to carry things, you can fit a lot in it, however a did experience a big problem about 2-3 weeks into using the bag, i would use it for going to the gym because i walk over a mile, i usually walk in crocs because they are comfy for me, but i don’t like working out in them so i bring workout shoes in the bag, as well as other things, the heaviest being a gallon size bottle of water (rarely ever being full when i’m going it the gym) and the second heaviest thing probably being my shoes i was just talking about, and somehow it was enough weight to cause the bag to rip in the bottom, and i was pretty upset as i’m a young man who’s only 18 and don’t really have the money to be buying a 200 dollar bag to ensure it will be able to carry a measly gallon of water, like cmon, a duffel bag can’t carry the weight of gym shoes, a gallon of water, tiny old spice body spray, and a personal umbrella all at once without ripping in the bottom, like the most important part to not rip at cuz all of the items could then fall out if it happens….anyways the bag still does get the job done, i wanted something to carry items from point A to point B, I can indeed get that done, and it isn’t uncomfortable or anything, as i said i walk over a mile to the gym and back home with this thing around my shoulders and i have no problem with the comfortability of it, looks nice even, black goes with every outfit in my opinion, it even has a compartment that i would assume is for keeping things cooled, which is where i kept my gallon of water…I actually kept using the bag after the big rip incident of 24’ because as i said i need something to get my stuff to the gym, but one day on my way home from the gym i got chipotle and i put the bag of chipotle inside the duffel bag (not the smartest idea) and when i got home I came to find out the inside of the black duffel bag turned white from sour cream ☹️☹️☹️ ever since i haven’t used the bag and i’m really only leaving this review to tell you all not to carry chipotle in the bag and not to carry a gallon of water in it or else it will rip on you 💔"
"Great travel bag or just as a gym bag. It’s spacious but not bulky and very easy to carry"
"The duffel bag is extremely large perfect to be a football duffel bag storage capacity is extremely large. It’s durable. It has a couple of extra pockets plus it comes with a small personal hygiene bag, which is perfect for football players because they need that and it has an end for you can open and put something in where it can’t get dirty, or you can put your stuff in there. I sure enough will buy another one if my grandson needs another one and it’s waterproof the water just bubbles off of it. Great news for football players."
"When I first received this bag in the small box I got it in I was a bit confused wondering if they sent me the correct item. As I unboxed the item I realized that this duffel bag actually can be folded up and more compact for easy storage in the future which I love by the way.  The quality seems very nice and the bag seems to be made pretty durable so I had to test it, when I unfolded it out of its compacted shape my cat decided that it was a good place to sleep so I grabbed my cat and put him in the bag left it unzipped and picked it up to see if it can hold him. ( he is rather chunky ) It seems to do well and it was lightweight even with him inside. So I did another test I am going on vacation soon so I jammed all the stuff I was going to pack and it all fit :)"
"This is a good medium sized bag for its price"
"As a football referee I use this bag to carry my gear. The 65 liter bag contains everything and has even spare room. Having a separate compartment for the shoes is just perfect since I don't soil my clothes with dirt and odors. The mini bag is just perfect to carry small accessories so you don't lose them in the large bag. The only negative is that the fabric is very light so the bag itself is very soft and barely hold itself. Seems look quite sturdy so it should last for a while. Not the best bag I had but a good bag for the price."
"This thing caught me off guard. I thought I was buying like a small filler bag that I would use possibly occasionally. I find this thing to be my go to almost all the time. Excellent zipper! Excellent handles! Great size for small amount of goods without feeling like you’re carrying way too big of a bag."
"Nice bag. Its bigger than it looks. Seems durable. Used it on a 2 week trip, so far so good"
"Nice and roomy, seems well put together. Just what I was looking for."
"So impressed with the quality of this duffel bag!"
"The bag size is as described, and the handles on both ends are convenient. However, it only has one zipper pocket."
"I got this for my husband as a general use bag. It was surprisingly rugged and just all around tough. Although I shouldn't have been surprised as Carhartt really is a good name. It was well constructed and has held up quite well to being overstaffed and slightly abused as his day-to-day life can be a little hectic. It's also holding up to the crazy weather that we have been having. You really can't go wrong with the name Carhartt. I would definitely recommend this whether it's for yourself or a gift as you should get years of use out of this bag."
"Used the bag once and the button broke on the handle.  I don’t recommend on purchasing because the quality is low even though it has the Carhartt brand."
"I ordered this product in a size 60L four times from different ads and different colours and received the 25L each time. I do not think the 60L exists!!That being said said - the bags are carhart quality and appear to be very durable."
"There is no way to rate the seller as the seller is Amazon.ca. I ordered this product 4 times and received the wrong size every time. I ordered the 60L and received the 25L every-time - Buyer beware! Overall the product is nice and of Carhartt quality but it is a pain that when ordering a 60L size and receiving the wrong size every time even after speaking with a customer service rep and they guaranteed I would receive the correct size the next time I ordered it. WRONG!"
"Simple duffel bag, but has the Carhartt quality and feel. Great space for use, nice straps, and sturdy construction, and is great for moving a ton of stuff"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Did not like how my order was wrong ordered 60l received 25l Whats going on I want my 60l"
"This is the second time Carhart sent me the wrong bag. It’s frustrating"
"I love the size and quality of this duffel bag. It is very lightweight. I was able to fit a lot of clothes in here. It is great for a carry-on. The designs are simple and have lasted me 20 days on my trip."
"The bag is good value, I can fit everything I use at the gym in it including my weight belt (not leather and folds flat), knee sleeves, bands, wrist wraps, lift straps etc. It’s got 2 dedicated zipper pockets, one on the outside and one on the inside which I use for my headphones and keys. It would also make a great travel gym bag due to its ability to compress down.Unfortunately there’s absolutely no sturdiness in the bag, and there’s no “bottom” that keeps it rigid and preventing the bag from folding in on itself when carrying. This is good if you’re traveling but is a con if you’re just going to a local gym with it. There’s also probably not room for a change of clothes/shoes along with your gym equipment so I wouldn’t recommend this as a work gym bag.Overall it’s useful for what I use it for and is small enough to bring with me to all the equipment I go to in the gym without putting it into a locker."
"I needed a smaller duffle bag and this one is nice quality and works for what I needed. I do wish it had pockets on the ends like the larger bags I have, but it’s still good"
"My old sack came apart carrying my music stuff (folding stand, harmonicas, page turner, IPad, etc). This bag easily fits all the stuff and provides easy carry and access. Good value for the money."
"This duffel bag fits a lot- I use it for hauling picnic stuff, sun shade, blanket, etc.  Zipper works fine. Compact/foldable.  Handles are sewn on securely but are not meant to support super heavy loads."
"Went for a weeklong trip to Europe with this bag as my carry on and had room to spare for gifts and souvenirs on the way back. Was worried about quality, but the bag held together nicely. Zippers work well. It's very thin and packs away well, which would also make it ideal as a day pack or just a spare bag to pack in your suitcase."
"Great bag and quality, but no shoulder strap really limits its usefulness."
"I've looked quite a bit for the proper bag to put my very thick yoga mat in, but most sacks zipper from the side, making it impossible to fold my mat into.  it was nice to find this sack that zippers from the end."
"Perfect for gym or overnight."
"yeah its fine its not bad"
"Very nice carry on bag with lots of compartments and pockets.  Beautiful color.  A lot bigger than expected. Definitely have plenty of room for a lot of things.  Cute toiletry bag with plenty of room. Really like the shoe separate compartment. The adjustable strap should make it easy to carry.  Even though I got the creme/ ivory color,  I think it will be easy to clean.  I ordered this for a trip the next day, and received the same day.  Recommend this bag!It made it through the trip without a single stain!! :)"
"I bought this bag to use along with my carry-on luggage. I saw it mentioned in an article and found it on Amazon. Now that I have one, I can't say enough good things. It's well made and completely lined. It has the bottom zip-out area that I can use for extra clothes or for packing extra golf gear--anything that won't break when the bag is set down or dropped. The inside main pocket is very roomy, has a zipped plastic-lined area for wet clothes, and there are all sorts of other inside pockets. I also like the multiple outside pockets for water bottle, phone, etc. The bag is big, but not so large that it can't be stuffed under the seat in front of you. Plus it comes in lots of colors, is set up to add a phone charger, has a shoulder strap and a separate, small zipper bag that can be used for oh so many things."
"This is a good bag for a few days of a trip, but here are a few things:Pros:Lots of pockets and spaceI like the separate shoe storage and the extra mini bags that come with thisEasy to Pack, solid zippersCons:-Once you put your shoes in, this thing keeps toppling over. I cannot get it to sit flat when I put it down on the ground. If you don't care about this, then it's fine. But I don't really like having my bag lay on its side because it cant stay upright-shoe space actually takes up a lot of the capacity. The part of the bag used for putting your clothes+ in holds a lot less than a duffel bag of a similar sizeOverall, I like this bag but I think i'd prefer a regular duffel and a bag for my shoes instead. It is definitely nice you can slip it over your carryon bag though."
"This bag is durable, great in size, easy to clean, super cute color. It has a build in show holder and a waterproof pocket on the inside! Rip resistant is a huge plus! The versatility is great you can use it for every day items or as a gym bag!"
"It had just the right amount of pockets for me. Easy to organize and find things. Excellent travel bag because it fits under the seat. The pad on the shoulder strap keeps it comfortable. and has a strap fits over the handles of my carry-on for when my shoulder gets tired.The bottom shoe compartment is convenient, but it is flimsy and unstable. I cut out a piece of hard foam in the shape of the bottom to give it more form And that works great."
"I purchased a medium-sized beige one for travel, and it‚Äôs been fantastic! It‚Äôs well-made, sturdy, and has a stylish design. The multiple pockets make it super convenient and keep everything organized. I‚Äôm extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!"
"The ETRONIK Gym Bag for Women is not only perfect for the gym but also great as a carry-on for travel! It‚Äôs spacious, with a separate compartment for shoes and wet items, and fits easily under the seat or in the overhead bin. The durable yet lightweight design, multiple pockets, and water-resistant lining make it super practical for trips. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a versatile bag."
"This bag hardly has an structure to it. There is nothing keeping the top portion of the bag from collapsing into the bottom part. Side pockets can not hold and support a water bottle. Inside pocket folds inward when I put my cellphone in it. The picture of the product is deceiving because this bag does not stand up on its own, it callaspes into crumpled up mess. Not ideal for a gym bag, best used for an overnight bag if you have no intention of using the side pocket or inside pocket to hold anything that has little weight to it. Overall I do not recommend."
"I recently got the ETRONIK Gym Bag, and it has been a game changer for my workouts! This bag is spacious enough to hold all my gym essentials, and the dedicated shoe compartment is a fantastic feature that keeps everything organized and separate.The design is stylish and practical, with multiple pockets that make it easy to find my items. The material feels durable, and the straps are comfortable for carrying, whether I‚Äôm heading to the gym or traveling.Overall, I highly recommend the ETRONIK Gym Bag for anyone looking for a functional and chic duffel bag. It‚Äôs perfect for workouts, travel, or weekend getaways!"
"This bag is perfect for my travels. It has a space at the bottom for shoes, a separate bag for whatever items you need to keep together and it's sturdy but light. Highly recommended"
"Absolutely love this bag perfect for weekend trips and has lots of pockets to store varying items. Love the durability and good quality!"
"Great size! Easy to use and perfect for work, gym, short trip"
"Very sturdy and nicely made! Zipper good, roomy, high value for money!"
"Wow, this is beyond my expectation, I'm so happy with it.  I wanted to get a little duffle to fit on top of my smaller carryon luggage for an international trip.  This would be used to carry all the extra stuff that I want close at hand at my seat, and this can easily be shoved under the seat.  I can also put my purse in here too just so that I'm not managing too many things.  The material is a very high end looking canvas, not thin nylon or thick army issue so it's sturdy enough but not flimsy.  It's got unisex styling!  Size to true, this fits right on top of my luggage without any spill over.  If I find something I like, I go back and buy more and I submit a 5 STAR review for this!  Zippers are well made and the shoulder strap is a plus.  I'm not a backpack person either when I travel!  (When on the move, my purse/wallet will be under my shirt!)"
"SImple, but good smaller sized bag (fits a typical towel, flip flops, water bottle and misc).  Quality seems good (used for 1 month).  Outside pocket is very small, not big enough for a cell phone.  Inner pocket is good size and could fit phone."
"My son needed a duffel bag for his gym clothes. He brings them home every week for washing and this bag is the perfect size. Everything fits and its not too bulky. He isn't easy on his things and it has held up beautifully."
"Fits more than you would think. Zipper is durable and doesn‚Äôt get caught. Reasonably priced. I spilt coffee on it and it beaded right off."
"Nice size but handle broke off the first time it was used."
"Very durable, easy cleaning fabric, strap is wide and very durable, perfect color, plenty of pockets,the portability is great, performance is perfect for cheer, workout, great for travel caryon"
"I love the size of this bag and it makes for a perfect gym bag; it fits the essentials and also packs easily into a locker.  It seems to be well made and the two zipped pockets are useful for keys and other essentials."
"I bought this bag for my brother a couple of months ago and the quality was as shown in the photos. Now, i decided to buy for myself and the bag i received is not the same as the one i ordered for my brother.The quality is rubbish, it feels like paper, the bag does not sit straight and when you put things inside it, it does not hold. Save yourself money and don‚Äôt buy.I‚Äôm guessing they have changed suppliers and the quality is absolutely horrible. The brand name is not even on the zippers as it is on my brothers bag.I will be returning my bag."
"This is a big duffle bag, not the most expensive. Will be good for our trip, however, if we traveleda lot I am not sure how it will hold up. Thinner material, but we will see how it does."
"It’s big and the material is great and it has wheels and take as many as you want .. very light weighted and good for travel"
"This bag is an upgrade from another basic bag I was considering. Very spacious interior, wheels very helpful. I packed at 50 lbs weight.  I bought 2. One tore during the trip and I threw it anway and the other made it back home with a torn handle. Not major issue for me as the bag has several handles. Definitely worth the price. If you fill to capacity for a checked bag, they will be a single use item."
"Very roomy. Sturdy material.Can fit contents of two suitcases inside."
"Good product, the most economic way to avoid buying expensive luggage, not very sturdy, but accomplish the mission. you can travel with it folded inside your other luggage and used it as another item in your checked-in bagagge. Would be great with better quality straps, but you're getting what you are paying for."
"I fly to events from time to time, and I don't want to have to check an empty bag to make sure I can bring things home, so for me this is perfect. It fits into my carry on bag (along with a long weekend worth of clothes and a change of shoes), and then I can throw my clothes or light, non-fragile items in it and check it for the flight home.So far it has survived several flights with no problems, including one where I honestly probably overloaded it with board games.It's inexpensive, so it certainly has a finite lifespan, but I've already gotten my money's worth out of it and will continue to use it until it falls apart."
"The first time we used this suitcase the zipper broke. Had to bring it to airport taped up and have them place in plastic bag for travel. This is outside the one month return window so we have no recourse. So frustrating!!"
"The wheels feel a little heavy some I’m kind of mixed about what I think. Over great quality"
"The duffel is very large, but lighter than you would expect, It does not have a frame along the bottom to the wheels so if you are packing it loosely you likely wont be able to roll it well.  But i got it on a great sale at the time so Its a solid purchase that I dont regret. I can imagine it holding about a weeks worth of clothes and belongings.  The zipper on top is large and easy to access things, but the hand grab handle seems a tad short when loaded, but comes with a shoulder strap slightly padded, with thicker plastic clips.Great value to me at sale price for sure. Suits my needs well!"
"The size was almost right for what we intended to use the bag for.We just had to pad it out ourselves.Yet to test its sturdiness with travelling to make sure it does not tear as easily as the other bag we used to have."
"Bought for my husbands work trip and he loved it. Thankful for the pockets. Rugged and just good quality. Would definitely recommend"
"I bought this for my husband because he travels out of town for work in construction. He loves it! Said the outside pockets are padded or the way it was made is really nice. He said he puts his phone charger in one of the small outside pockets and you can’t even feel there’s anything in the pocket. So he feels like he things won’t get damaged."
"Perfect for my husband who works outdoors and needs to bring a change of clothes with him. It also fits his medicine and diabetes supplies."
"This duffel bag is STRONG AND DURABLE, and it houses all of your essentials with lots of room inside of it sizing no matter what the particular purchaser uses it for and matter what the intended use is for it has strong stitching and is put together with sturdy sewing so this will last a while depending on how it is used by the personal uses of it and perhaps if  it is used correctly ,a lengthy duration of use, Definitely a strong buy for the money and would recommend to other AMAZON shoppers who like nice craftsmanship and good strong materials for their bags ."
"Bought this bag to replace my overnight bag. I have several other Carhartt bags and they have stood up over several years of use."
"It made it through 4 flights and its still like new."
"I bought this for my son to use as a diaper bag for his daughter. It's perfect!"
"My traveling son needed an upgrade from an old backpack for weekend trips.  This duffle did the trick!  Great value for money."
"It has a lot of space for all my clothes and the extra little pockets inside are amazing for extra room. The pockets outside of the bag are also very useful when it comes to smaller things like chargers!"
"I was impressed with the one I had bought for my boyfriend. We have been using it for over a year, now he uses it when he goes away to work. It’s taken the place of his suit case. I had to buy my own lol. Great Bang for my buck."
"This bag is perfect for my job in construction fits everything I need for my job and the compartments are great for having even thing organized"
"Based on the description, I was expecting a bag with the material weight of canvas or heavy duty canvas, this bag is fairly average."
"I am replacing my outdoor research duffle that I had for over 20 years. The new bag is even better than the last one because it has a large u shaped opening for the main enclosure, two large pockets at each end, a rectangular shape, and one smaller pocket on the front side. It is the perfect duffle. The new bag also has a more comfortable strap and handles. Just a note: I had to replace my old bag because I overstuffed it, and broke the zipper. It was a user error, not from poor quality. It had been to multiple countries, and spent the past few years as the main gear bag for snowboarding gear. It’s washable, and highly durable."
"So I've been in the market for a medium sized duffle for car camping for some time.  I've been using the round single zipper type duffle bag from REI for the past year.  While that bag is very rugged the organization inside the bag is very poor.  The zipper doesn't open fully to see the content inside and it's difficult to separate gear.I went into REI to check out some bags they have there.  My favorite was the REI 65L Tech Beast duffle (it's the closest in size to this medium duffle).  While it was really awesome at $90 it was a little expensive for a duffle that would be used for car camping and weekend trips.  Not to mention, the 65L didn't have a separate compartment for shoes.  I would have to get the 100L bag for that, which was more expensive and way to big for my needs.I picked this up on sale and was expecting it to be cheap and flimsy.  I was defiantly surprised when opened it up and saw that the bag is made out of a thicker canvas type material.  There is a lot of double stitching, including the strap area.  The organization of the bag is pretty good, and it has a cavernous opening to be able to see all the contents of the main compartment which helps me to keep my gear organized and not mess stuff up when I grab a change of clothes out of it.  Granted this bag is not the same quality, and lacks a few features of say the REI tech duffle, but for the price I'll try this guy out for the year and buy a nicer bag when I get some extra cash.I'd say this size would be best for trips under a week long.  4-5 days is my typical camping trip length and I've been able to fit all my clothes, extra jacket, toiletries, camping towel, and a pair of hiking boots in this without issue."
"sturdy bag, holds our heavy duty ski gear. also comes with a smaller zippered bag inside which is great for toiletries."
"Lots to like about this bag.  I have it in several sizes, the Large is closer to the size of a big gym bag, the X-Large is as big as many hockey bags.  It has side pockets for shoes or boots or things you want to separate from the main compartment.  It has a small outside pocket that can hold maps or paperwork and when unzipped  on the XL it fits a coaching clipboard rather well.  It has a collapsible carrying bag that can be used on its own.  It has carrying straps that go completely around to the other side, good zippers and quality stitching.  It is fairly durable and holds up to normal wear and tear.The only downside is that it is not indestructible.  Airlines and sharp skates are able to cut the nylon fabric.  I have been really satisfied with the performance for what it is.  That having been said, I am still looking for the holy grail of bags to protect my pack from the airlines when traveling.  I thought I had it in the XL.  After seeing the abuse that this bag has taken at their hands, I can only imagine how many straps and buckles I would have to replace if I had not had it as a first layer of protection for my pack.  If I have to buy one of these every couple of years to protect my pack, I would still consider it a good investment.  In the meantime, let me know if you find something a bit sturdier."
"I was looking for a large duffle with side pockets.  Most of the ones I found were too small - more like a large gym bag than a travelling one.  This one fit the bill.  The side pockets are large too - large enough to fit my size 15 hiking shoes and still have the other pocket left over for other items.  The side pockets do not take up additional space inside the duffle (like many gym bags) so there is PLENTY of room for everything."
"The size of the bag was perfect. The outer material seemed sturdy and zippers worked well. An extra zippered bag comes inside. Overall, the bag seemed to meet my needs, however on day 2 of using it, the interior pocket seam ripped. The bag was not overpacked. I think the interior is just made poorly. If you used this for very light use, it might be ok, but I don't recommend it for travel."
"Fantastic bag for traveling perfect for taking items that are not fragile. Easy to fold when you arrive in your destination and doesn’t take space at all perfect perfect perfect highly recommended and very strong product so far I have purchased three of these."
"Good quality. Nice duffel."
"I love the quality and roominess !"
"This is a high quality bag for the price. Very nice material and seems very well made. It is lightweight, yet sturdy. The bag is not rigid, but holds its shape well when packed. The straps are a nice thick but soft, flexible material. The zipper is very nice as well. I use this bag for packing clothes for camping trips. It is a good size for a weekend trip."
"This bag is perfect for my needs. Love the color! Great material that makes for easy cleaning. Upon purchase, I did have to air it out for several weeks because the material was off gassing with a moderate chemical smell, but afterwards, it was good to go. I also like the inside pockets and storage. The only other downside was that the bag closes in an odd way where the ends raise up on the corners, so it's not straight across like a regular duffle bag."
"There is a lot of smaller pockets and larger sections to store things, it I'd a material that easy to wipe out, similar to rain jackets.  The color and design is exactly as shown and the two strap types make it very easy to carry around! However, my only complaint is that if you put anything in the inside mesh pockets taller than the side of the pocket, it just tips over and falls out into the bag because the pocket has no support. None of the bag actually has supports, so it doest stay up, or open, and things tend to get all mixed together because the inside pockets don't close, but that means there is way more space to shove things in! And it holds well to being stuffed full, the zipper holds shut"
"Nice little bag for babies essentials while traveling. Pockets inside were a nice surprise as well! Handles are study as well for the cheap price."
"I needed a weekender bag on a recent trip. I was able to get next day delivery. For the price I paid, I am pleasantly surprised at how durable and spacious this bag was. It fit all of my items and then some. I was able to easily carry and travel with it and connect it to my carry on. The extra internal and external pockets were an added bonus. Again, for the price, this was a steal. Very satisfied."
"I needed a cheap all-black duffle bag, and I am blown away by the quality of this bag! It has pockets inside and out and heavy-duty straps. I'll probably buy more just because of the quality vs. the price. Great packaging also makes it perfect for gift-giving. You can't beat the price."
"Light and roomy and sturdy loving it"
"Use this for travel for 4 days, fit everything no problem, great buy!"
"I ordered these shorts for my dad for his birthday and he loved them. The size is true to size and for the price it's a very good product."
"Great shorts!! Very comfortable"
"Nice shorts but they do run small. I’m a large and had to order a X-Large. The X-large fit me perfectly."
"Love these shorts. Length is as illustrated and the material is top notch. That said, as others have mentioned the elastic around the legs for the inside lining is a bit tight. Not so much that it is uncomfortable for a 30 minute run, but I could see needing to cut it for more extended wear."
"My son loves these shorts. Very comfortable, nice stretch, lightweight. Great for working out or just hanging out."
"Love the fit and waste band - durable compared to older design shorts."
"I'm a 31 sized waist for all my pants so I got the medium.  It felt way too snug for a medium.  I could go for a large, but I don't want to bother at this point."
"Good Quality running shorts. The black strip on the side is for air conditioning; but you can't see through this. I was a little worried at first!!"
"Belle short🤩"
"Comfortable"
"The CRZ YOGA Men's Linerless Workout Shorts are excellent! The 7-inch length is just right, and the material is lightweight and quick-drying, making them super comfortable for any workout. The pockets are a great addition, fitting my phone securely during runs. The fit is spot-on, and the Melanite color looks sharp. Highly recommend for anyone looking for durable and stylish gym shorts!"
"If you’re debating between these CRZ Yoga’s Hybrid Workout Shorts and their higher priced Casual Thicker Shorts, here’s the real scoop from someone who lives out of a suitcase:The Hybrid Workout Shorts are your go-to for almost anything. They’re lightweight, slightly tapered at the back for a clean look, and so versatile I wear them everywhere—from the gym to the grocery store. They pack so small, you can take several pairs without sacrificing space.However, the Casual Thicker Shorts, while incredibly comfortable and slightly more polished in appearance, have a downside. They’re bulkier, making them less ideal for a tightly packed bag. Plus, I found a slight inconsistency with one pair where the pocket didn’t sit flush against the hips, which could be annoying.Bottom line: For the active traveler or anyone with limited packing space, the Hybrid Shorts are a no-brainer. They’re multifunctional and efficient. Choose the Casual Shorts if you’re not pressed for space and prioritize comfort over convenience. Always check the fit right out of the box, especially around the pockets."
"This is not a paid review. This is not a compensated review to keep a product. I am just a guy looking for quality, comfortable and good fitting workout shorts. These are legit. I do not have any from another high end brand to compare directly. I can say that if you blind fold someone and have them feel these, they will not think they are a not a major name brand for $28. These shorts are worth every penny. Fit is excellent. Comfort is superb. And quality is unmatched for the price. You really have to put these on and in your hands to understand. I know you're seeing all these cheap brands pop up and it's overwhelming. I am here to save you time. Try these. My guess is they are very comparable to a company that sells shorts for $80. I included a picture to better show the material and texture of these shorts. They are very lightweight. I am 6' 175 athletic build and medium is perfect. Don't even have to tie them."
"First impressions: good looking pair of shorts for the gym, the pool, or for loungewear. Soft & stretchy material. Comfortable with breathing room but doesn't look overly baggy. Ample room in pockets for phone or wallet. Zippable compartment and coin pocket are a plus. Hem of shorts sits about 4 inches above the knee for me."
"These are great work out shorts if you wear compression shorts. They fit as advertised and actually stay up. I always wear compression shorts when I workout so they were just the ticket."
"Been using these for about 2 years .  Have about 5 pairs now.  great for the price.  Durability is on par with lulu's"
"My husband loves these shorts. We live in FL and he wears these like almost every day. He says they're super comfortable and look great for both at home and going out and about. Also, they have plenty of pockets. I've purchased 6 pairs in different colors for him. He has a pair of lululemons, but prefers these over those ones!"
"I'm very pleased with the workout shorts - they fit very comfortably and are extremely durable."
"Seem to be decent quality light weight shorts. Fit TTS. Im 6’3, 33/34 waist and ordered M"
"I didn’t know what l was missing by wearing cotton and cotton blend shorts and getting so hot and sweaty with no A/C in my house!I am not a runner- lol- l have Hip Failure and need a new one- the fabric of these shorts is sublime! Cool, lightweight with an inner lining panty, no stretching and light as a feather! I got these on sale and hey are so high quality that I bought another pair at the higher cost because they are super worth it!!!!"
"These are very lightweight, they fit great in the waist and in my opinion they’re the perfect length. I really like the color. There is a liner so if you didn’t think about coordinating your panties and have a darker color on it’s ok you can’t see them. Idk about the rest of you ladies out there but for me, finding shorts that fit in the waist without being huge in the butt can be a thing. These are my new go to."
"Love the bright color"
"In general I like these shorts. They fit well, although I would say that the sizing chart might be a little off. I bought XL based on the chart but I think I might really want an L -- the XL seems just a bit too roomy, and I normally wear an L in bottoms. The fabric is fantastic, incredibly lightweight. All of that said, they have the worst shorts pocket situation possible. There is just one zippered side pocket, on the right, and it is absolutely tiny. You could pretty much fit just your ID and a car key in there. Since most of us use running shorts for a lot more than just running, this pocket situation seems kind of unforgivable. I was prepared to order more pairs of these if I liked the first pair, but I'm not going to because of the pocket situation."
"My wife loves these shorts. They are extremely comfortable, stay cool and are the perfect length. They are great for working out in and you can even use them easily over a swim suit and swim in them with ease if you are looking for a bit more coverage for a swim suit"
"I like the fit, but the inner lining is way thinner and lower quality than the past versions of these shorts. Pocket is barely big enough to hold keys and a card, getting my hands in it is difficult. Wish the pocket was bigger and that it had pockets on both sides to fit a phone - who goes out with just a key and a card? Probably won’t buy this version again."
"Great fitting and bright. The color did not fade."
"Highly recommend"
"As a dedicated fitness enthusiast always on the lookout for stylish and functional activewear, stumbling upon BMJL Women's Running Shorts was like hitting the jackpot! These shorts are not only an incredible value but also a spot-on dupe for the beloved Lululemon styles – and dare I say, even better in some aspects!First and foremost, let's talk about comfort. The elastic high-waisted design offers a snug yet comfortable fit that stays in place during even the most intense workouts. The fabric is soft and stretchy, providing the perfect amount of support without feeling restrictive. Plus, the quick-dry feature is a game-changer for sweaty gym sessions, ensuring that I stay cool and comfortable from start to finish.But what truly sets these shorts apart is their practicality. The addition of pockets is an absolute game-changer, providing convenient storage for essentials like keys, cards, or even a phone. It's a small detail, but one that makes a world of difference during workouts or outdoor runs when I need to keep my hands free.Another thing I appreciate is the variety of colors and patterns available. Whether you prefer classic black or bold prints, there's something for everyone in BMJL's collection. Plus, the quality of the stitching and construction rivals that of much pricier brands, ensuring that these shorts hold up wash after wash without losing their shape or color.And let's not forget about the price point. Compared to the steep prices of Lululemon shorts, BMJL Women's Running Shorts are a steal, offering the same level of style, performance, and comfort at a fraction of the cost. It's a win-win for budget-conscious shoppers like myself who refuse to compromise on quality.Overall, I can't recommend BMJL Women's Running Shorts highly enough. They're comfortable, stylish, and functional – everything you could ask for in activewear. Whether you're hitting the gym, going for a run, or just lounging at home, these shorts are sure to become a staple in your wardrobe. Don't hesitate – give them a try and thank me later!"
"I got black & blue. The blue is more of a dusty blue & not as bright as I expected, but I still like them. Dare I say, I think these shorts look kind of sexy when I have them on! I ordered both pair in the 2.5 inch, high waist, size Medium. They fit great & aren’t too tight or uncomfortable in the stomach. For reference, I’m 5’7, 135 lbs. I’m not fit & I have a little bit of a tummy pooch. For those complaining about the small, backwards pocket, remember these are running shorts. They’re made for runners & nobody runs with large items in their pockets, nor do they want items bouncing around on their thighs while running. They have the panty liner attached inside but it’s not too tight or uncomfortable either. Great quality, comfortable fit, & I'm happy overall."
"Really like these shorts - they're incredibly comfortable and I really like the brown color as it has a touch of purple that is really nice. They are kind of puffy which isn't the most flattering, but the dolphin hem on the side helps with that. The one downside is the weird pocket - having a zipper pocket is super helpful, but it's sewn in reverse vs forward, so goes backwards towards the rear. Putting things in the pocket is awkward, especially since it's a bit small for a phone. Otherwise these are great!"
"I like the way the shorts fit. The waistband is super elasticated and thick for tummy control. Decent length, would have to try them out to see if they ride up too much though. I'm 5'4"" and 160 lbs, typically a size 10-12. I got the Large in Summergreen. Fits well but the color is not at all green. Its more like greyish blue. Nice color but not what I was anticipating. Probably gonna return for a different color."
"These are very cute and comfy and true to size. Not tight in the thighs at all. I wear them to practice where  I run around a lot and they are great!"
"I love all the color options and have tried these shorts several times in several colors, but just don't love them.I have a pear shaped body with a small waist and athletic hips and thighs.  It feels like I am in between a medium and large, but the mediums are not flattering and the larges look very baggy.  I have also noticed that after several hours of wear, the waist band starts feeling very tight and is uncomfortable.I do like that they have a zipper pocket and the built in underwear, but wish the sizing worked out a little better."
"I got these for my niece for a track meet at night, the colors didn't disappoint. They fit well and are true to size, wear well, and wash well. They dry very quickly and the material is a good quality."
"These BMJL Women's Running Shorts are my absolute favorite!What I Liked: I wear them all the time and even have them in different colors. The gray pairs perfectly with everything, making them incredibly versatile. I love the fit—they’re not too tight, and the higher waist is super flattering. They’re easy to style with a crop top, tank top, or even a sweatshirt, which adds to their versatility.These shorts have become a staple in my wardrobe due to their comfort. I've even purchased multiples in the same colors because I wear them so often!What I Disliked: Honestly, I can’t think of any downsides. They’ve been just what I was looking for!Overall, I highly recommend these shorts for anyone seeking comfort and style in their workout gear!"
"LOVE how high waisted they are, and definitely a great lulu dupe!The material is great, feels good quality and will be great for the summer!Built in underwear is also very comfy."
"Very comfortable and the delivery was very quick."
"Best workout shorts I owned. Has inner lining and the material is amazing! 100% recommend to get your hands on it"
"Horrible quality shorts received stained and seller refusing to refund although providing photos. Very unprofessional seller , selling used items as brand new"
"Bought these as a look alike to the lululemon fast and free shorts., but much more affordable. They are a good light material. Very comfortable and have a pocket in the back. This is the second pair I have bought and will likely get more in different colors!"
"Loved the style and fabric. I used them to run a half marathon and felt good the entire race. They are very conftrable for running and outdoor activities. If you are looking for some short to run a 10K or attend bootcamp this are the perfect pair. I have them in two colors and they feel great."
"Super cute but fit ran small and I needed to size up. Material is super breathable and doesn’t seem cheap!"
"Love the fit and quality. But the yellow color is see through so you see the built in granny panty very clearly. I bet they are great in darker colors though."
"Love!!!! So soft, great material. Holds up very well in the wash and has built in liners. I find these more flattering than the lululemon shorts."
"I only really wear lululemon shorts. I love their fast and free but they never have any colors in stock and I decided why not try a “dupe”, and these are reallly similar to the lulu fast and frees. But … these are weirdly kind tight and the waist band is not thick enough so it’s a weird rise, like it’s not low rise but it’s not high rise but not mid rise either… idk. They just look unfinished and cheap. But they aren’t the worst shorts! They are pretty comfy and the vibrant color is nice. The color is just like the picture."
"didn’t realize that the shorts are connected so it’s not as flowy as the lulu ones but still cute"
"In ordered a medium hoping for a flowy, but snatching short. The waistband was too wide, and the shorts were not flowy at all. The material is very thin and hugs my thighs which is not ideal for working out."
"These CRZ YOGA running shorts are a new favorite! The high waist is supportive and stays in place, while the V-split design adds freedom of movement for running and workouts. The mesh liner is a great addition for comfort and breathability, and they dry super fast. Stylish and functional—perfect for the gym or outdoor runs!"
"Great shorts, i read reviews saying they’re big in the waist but they’re very true to size. I’m a 35” mid waist and large were great. I’m a size 10 normally so if you’re closer to a 12/14 i would definitely go XL."
"These are lightweight, breathable and flattering. Perfect for long runs. They fit a little on the large side, but I'd say they're generally true to size. I will be buying more!"
"These are a great pick when looking for a running short that’s affordable.I do have a few nit picky complaints.For the price I’m quite happy with these and got two colors.They’re super comfortable first of all and very flattering. I went with the medium, as that’s what I usually get for shorts because I have an athletic build with bigger thighs and a smaller waist. So the first thing is that I wish I could tighten the waist band. When I run I want a tighter waist to keep them from falling down in the front. They don’t fall off by any means but they just bunch up and require constant adjustment when running.For walking, wearing around the house or around town, the medium is a perfect fit for what I want and I don’t have an issue needing to adjust them.My second complaint is about the built in underwear. The fabric feels a little cheap and I don’t think will hold up well over time. They’re a little like granny panties but they are necessary because of the short style so theres no accidental butt cheek flashing.Overall, this IS a good pick for an affordable short and the colors cut and fit are exactly as pictured and I am happy. I expected there would possibly be some tiny things I didn’t like."
"I love this brand and everything they sell is usually true to size but I think these shorts ran a little small. Still so cute and exchanging them for a different size!"
"These run a little small, but they do fit me. Because of the design, when you sit down, the back portion falls back and your entire thigh is exposed. They are soft and thin."
"The color was spot on for what I was looking for. The built in brief does not dig into you at all, very comfortable. The lightweight material makes it great for lifestyle, running, yoga, and pickleball.  True to size, XS."
"Obsessed with the style and how these fit. They are super light weight and high quality and look so good on. My new favorite workout shorts!"
"Great shorts!!"
"I have been searching for a new affordable pair of running shorts for a while.  I have used UA SpeedPocket Shorts for years and they are starting  to look like it.  Outside of those my mian pair are Brooks Sherpa's due to the snug phone pocket and tons of space for my gels.  I took a chance on these when i saw the inside phone pocket that was incorporated into the right hip pocket.  From the get go, the fabric was the first impressive part.  Lightweight and moisture wicking for sure.  Exactly what you'd want in a high quality pair of shorts.  I have a usual waist of 31-32"" and the medium was snug but not tight.  I think a Large would have been too big.  I love the 5"" length, short and breathable, but not blinding cars with my pale thighs.  I wasn't sold 100% on the phone packet during my runs, as it does tend to bounce a bit more than I'd like.  Slow casual runs are fine, but when i get into speed drills or tempo runs it becomes pretty noticeable.  Never did I think it would fall out, just didn't like the constant patting against my thigh.  The waistband is very comfortable, and the internal drawstring does a great job of getting rid of any looseness left.  I enjoy the side pockets and the phone pocket a lot.  If I had 1 upgrade to it, it would be to add a small key fob pocket somewhere.  Otherwise I am confident that these will give me many miles and years of running."
"Got a medium sense that's what I usually wear in shorts, but ended up going a size up, and I am glad I did. These are an excellent pair of running shorts, have pockets, and comfy. No issues, just go a size up."
"These shorts are as durable as they re comfortable."
"It specifies a 2XL for a 32-34 inch waist; however, a 2XL has a circumference of about 39 inches.Will update my review after exchanging for a smaller size."
"I’m not a “runner” but wear these to the gym. I like the light weight feel, quick dry material and overall look and feel. I’m not one for  gym “shorts” that almost touch my ankles so these 5in are perfect.(:{)"
"I been searching for this color for a long time as it is out of stock in UA store for a long time. Item as described, fits perfectly."
"I like the fit, length, and design generally. But they’re not stretchy, so they’re a bit uncomfortable as you move."
"Very good shorts. Very pleased with this purchase. Two pockets (left and right), draw string fastening, good strong waistband, and comfortable inner liner. Very good indeed."
"I never usually where shorts but decided to get these for swimming. Now I where them all the time! And I love the colour!"
"CRZ yoga's butterluxe collection is great! The material is buttery soft. It is thick, but not too thick. The six inch shorts stay in place well throughout a long workout on the mat or otherwise. They come in lots of great colors to choose from. I like to get a few colorful pieces and a few standard black so that I can mix and match lots of different colored tops. I work from home, so I live in these all summer and wear their leggings in the winter. They wash perfectly in the machine and come out of the dryer beautifully. They fit true to size, and they have lots of stretch to accommodate different body shapes and sizes. They have the quality of higher priced brands."
"Omg these are so freaking soft!! Immediately after I put them on I did not want to ever take them off! They are the perfect length and size. Fit perfectly and the pockets did their job! Not see through at all. Quality was wonderful. And I’d say very flattering. Just buy them!!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



EDIT TO ADD: I now own two full sets and it’s the first thing I gravitate towards. I absolutely love the color options and these shorts never ride up! The quality is great! Absolutely love the sage gray!I love everything about these shorts and brand. It is extremely affordable. I watched a review video on your tube that called this brand a Skims dupe. I’ve never owned a skims product but I honestly feel like what’s the point when I have these instead. I have never felt better when I wear anything from this company. The shorts are the 4th product that I own now.I will say, the warehouse shipped the matching top instead of the shorts. But it was a quick return and I got the shorts quickly. There are no pockets. But I’m willing to over look that. They are comfortable and fit well on my body type. 10/10 highly recommend. I will be buying ALL the colors."
"I am very picky when it comes to spandex/leggings and the way they fit and feel. I usually end up returning most because the quality and/or fit just isn’t right. These spandex are super high quality and buttery soft! I have another pair of leggings by this brand and when I saw these spandex, I knew I had to try them. When I buy a new pair of spandex, I’m always nervous about them being see through and/or riding up. Neither of these things are an issue! They feel amazing on, are very flattering, and they are perfect for working out or just everyday wear. Another huge bonus is you don’t constantly have to yank them up, they stay in place. I plan on getting more colors! Highly recommend!"
"Literally love these shorts!! They feel buttery soft, thicker but comfortable material, not see through,  and they don’t ride up! I got a size small and they were the perfect length for working out, running errands, etc. You honestly can’t beat the price point too! My only complaint is that the color appears darker in the photo. Once they arrived, they were a lighter chocolate brown, which is fine i guess. I will be repurchasing more of these shorts in the future!"
"I absolutely love these shorts. They are so comfortable while providing decent support. The material is thick enough you don’t have to worry about skin showing but not too thick that you’re overheating while wearing them. The length was perfect for wearing with oversized hoodies or t-shirts. The quality is amazing for the price and after endless washes they still look just as good. I was even able to wear them throughout my first and second trimester comfortably."
"LOVE these shorts! I have 5+ pairs that I rotate through weekly as a full time yoga instructor. These shorts are the perfect length -both stylish & functional. The perfect Lulu shoes at a fraction of the cost. Love how soft the fabric is yet it provides shape and structure to form fit the body; hugs the body with the perfect amount of stretch ones without being too tight and do not roll down! Shorts stay in place throughout an entire yoga class! They come in a wide varieties of color - love them all and haven’t had any issues being see through. Save your money on higher end brands and buy these shorts!!!"
"I’m serious. The fit is perfect, true to size, holds you in without being too compressive. I have worn them countless times and the quality of the fabric has held up after many, many washes. Legitimately comfortable enough to sleep in and also to wear when working out and going for runs (!). Like how is that even possible? Sorcery, probably.I’m 5’10, relatively athletic, with a butt and thighs, the 6” inseam is exactly what I wanted. I already have two pairs and will be buying more."
"I loved it so much that i got another color after trying it out!"
"I've been using the Champion Athletic Shorts for several months now, primarily for my morning elliptical workouts, and they have quickly become my go-to shorts. The fit is true to size, and I love how they are loose-fitting without feeling baggy. The lightweight fabric is incredibly comfortable and breathable, which is perfect for my intense cardio sessions. Plus, the Double Dry technology really works wonders, keeping me dry and comfortable throughout my workouts.One of my favorite features is the side pockets, which are perfect for holding my keys and other essentials. The elastic drawcord waistband allows for a custom fit.  Despite numerous washes, these shorts show little signs of wear, which speaks to their durability. The iconic C logo patch at the hem is a nice touch, adding a bit of style. Overall, I highly recommend these shorts for anyone looking for comfort, functionality, and durability in their workout gear."
"These were a super sale at $11. They fit perfect without feeling constricted at the waist like other elastic banded shorts. I ordered 3xlt and they go to just above my knees. They are both very cool and comfortable as the material is on the thinner side. They also hang nicely without looking baggy.  The pockets are adequate. Not really deep but they hold essentials. As a 6' 6"" 300lb guy, its hard to find clothes/shorts that not only fit but are wearable, look good,  and are comfortable. These are by far the best shorts I've come across."
"Comfortable, fits well, doesn’t absorb moisture easily. Good for workouts and pickleball"
"These shorts are comfortable and soft. They have a nice slightly above the knee fit and look great."
"These aren’t favorite shorts. They didn’t shrink much after being washed so the size is very accurate. The pockets are great and hold all of my things. They look very nice, and are not see through at all. They aren’t thick, which means the temperature is almost always nice. The durability is pretty good as i’ve washed them several times and they have not been ripped."
"Size is as expected. Good material."
"I paid $11.99 and wear these to the gym every day. Best shorts ever. Lightweight  for sure.🏈"
"I just picked up a L maroon short on Prime Day. There are a few things I like and one major dislike so far.Pros: I like the color on these shorts. The fabric is lightweight and comfortable. The pockets are deep and they hold a variety of items (keys wallets phone etc) without any issue. The waist isn’t constricting and I can use the drawstring if I want a tighter fit.Cons: as you can tell on the photo, I’m noticing small deficiencies throughout the shorts. I’ve only worn them around the house after washing them. There should be no reason why these small tears are popping up. If it was just one or two, I’d only knock it down a star but there are enough for me to notice.I doubt I would order another of these shorts because of the condition of these shorts. It’s too bad because I do like them more than dislike them."
"These are comfortable shorts. The material is really good. The price is maybe too high for what you’re getting. I’m wondering if I could probably get something similar at one of those big box stores that sell clothing! I’m keeping them, but I don’t love them the colour of the green isn’t a true khaki. It’s more of like a warm khaki. So I’ll probably just wear them around the house or when I’m playing tennis."
"Fit nice, helps stay cool during hot summer basketball games"
"These shorts are comfortable. They’re honestly great for the price. They’re flexible and stretchy. I will say, after only 4-5 washes, there are loose threads, but I expected this, as they were cheap. Also, they may be a bit sheer, so I advise a base layer or compression shorts underneath."
"The Real Essentials 5 Pack of Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Athletic Performance Shorts has quickly become a staple in my workout wardrobe. These shorts offer everything I need for an active lifestyle—comfort, durability, and a great fit.First off, the dry-fit material is a game changer. Whether I'm hitting the gym, going for a run, or just lounging around, these shorts keep me cool and dry. The sweat-resistant fabric really works, wicking away moisture so I don’t have to deal with that sticky, uncomfortable feeling during intense workouts.Each pair in the pack is lightweight and breathable, making them perfect for a variety of activities. I also appreciate the elastic waistband, which has just the right amount of give without feeling too loose or too tight. The drawstring is a nice touch, allowing for easy adjustments to get that perfect fit.One of the best things about this 5-pack is the value. It’s hard to find such high-quality shorts at this price point, and getting five pairs means I always have a fresh pair ready to go, no matter how busy my week gets. The variety of colors is great, too—they’re stylish enough to wear outside of the gym, which is a bonus.In short, these shorts tick all the boxes for anyone looking for comfortable, high-performing athletic wear. Whether you're a serious athlete or just someone who likes to stay active, the Real Essentials 5 Pack is a fantastic choice. They're well-made, versatile, and offer unbeatable value. Highly recommended!"
"I have two sets of these shorts, one I purchased in august of 2020 and one in august 2021. Clearly I went back to buy another set a year later so I must like them, and I do. They are priced INCREDIBLY well. At the time of the first purchase, I had just started playing sports again and needed lightweight shorts to cut and move in. These are DEFINITELY those shorts. They breath very well, they're comfortable enough that now I not only work out in them, I lounge around the house in them and go to sleep in them as well. They've held up pretty well to washing. I wash them on hot with powdered detergent and oxiclean powder and rinse them twice and then dry them on medium heat. They've probably gone through at least 100 washes thus far and I'm still wearing them. Yes, some of the seams have loose thread, yes some of them start to come off over time but they're $6 a short and none of them have unraveled to the point that there are any holes or they are unwearable, it's just something you would see when you look at the inner part of the waistband.The ONE weakness of these shorts is the pockets. I've had several that have started developing holes in the side seams of the pockets. Now it only started happening a year+ later and they've been beat up and washed many times so that's not quite so bad, but still it'll happen. I suspect this is more to do with how big and heavy phones are nowadays since it's always on my right pocket (where my phone goes) and started pretty much after I upgraded from an iphone 7 to an iphone 13 pro. But two years and 100+ aggressive washings later, only 3 out of 10 shorts have pocket holes and only one has a hole big enough that I'm scared to put my phone in the pocket.These are fantastic shorts and they could easily charge double. I plan to replace some of the original ones with a new set even now."
"I recently purchased the Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Mesh Athletic Performance Gym Shorts with Pockets, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. These shorts have quickly become my go-to choice for workouts and daily activities.First and foremost, the comfort level of these shorts is unparalleled. The mesh fabric is lightweight and breathable, ensuring that I stay cool and comfortable even during intense workouts. The airy feel of the material is perfect for hot summer days and high-intensity exercises.The fit is spot on. I ordered my usual size, and the shorts fit me perfectly, providing a comfortable and non-restrictive feel. The elastic waistband offers a secure yet flexible fit, allowing for a full range of motion during exercises.The addition of pockets is a game-changer. I love having the convenience of pockets to hold my essentials, such as my phone and keys, during my gym sessions. It eliminates the need for carrying a separate bag, streamlining my workouts and making them more enjoyable.The 5-pack option is fantastic value for money. I now have a variety of colors to choose from, and each pair is equally comfortable and well-made. The quality of the construction is evident, and I can tell that these shorts are built to withstand frequent use.Moreover, these shorts are not only great for the gym but also perfect for various activities and casual wear. Whether I'm running errands, playing sports, or simply lounging at home, these shorts are my reliable choice.Cleaning and maintaining these shorts is a breeze. They wash well, and the color and shape remain intact even after multiple washes.In conclusion, the Real Essentials Men's Mesh Athletic Performance Gym Shorts with Pockets are a must-have for any active individual. Their comfort, perfect fit, and functional design make them an excellent choice for workouts and daily wear. With the added bonus of pockets and the value of the 5-pack, this purchase has exceeded my expectations in every way. I highly recommend these gym shorts to anyone in need of comfortable and versatile activewear. I am thrilled with my purchase and will definitely be buying more from Real Essentials in the future!"
"Very comfortable, my son love to wear them for football training don't feel hot of sweat in them"
"Sizing is normal and as described, super comfortable to run or hike in, very breathable. I like how they show some leg on the side but are long enough in the back to stay covered with no cheek hanging out. Waistband makes you look snatched. 10/10!"
"I ran 20 miles in these to test them out and fell in love. They don’t hike up or rub and feel great! Only regret is that I didn’t buy more. They look great and feel awesome. I wore them in a marathon two weeks ago and will now use them till they are falling apart"
"I saw some reviews saying run small, so I purchased in two sizes to be safe. I feel my normal size fit perfectly, so I would say true to size. Very comfy, I like the pink color and the pocket for storing my car keys. The only thing I didn’t like was I feel once I start walking or jogging they start riding up. At one point it almost looked like I did not even have on shorts because they wrote up higher than a T-shirt. I’m still planning to keep them though"
"I needed some shorts to go white water rafting and these were amazing. Quick dry and no bunching. Very comfortable."
"My daughter loves to work out and wear expensive work out clothes.  Specifically from Lululemon.  But when she realized she can get less expensive but good quality work out clothes from Amazon, she is saving her money.  We bought her this pair in black for Christmas.  She loves the way that they fit and that they are not transparent, even when she is bending over.  They aren't too short and they don't ride up.  She lives with us and she has washed them at least 10 times and the color hasn't changed, the seams are in tact and the material remains the same.  This is a great way to save money and use it wisely.  These shorts are definitely a win purchase and an item we are purchasing again."
"These are fine. They ran small for me - going to size up.  I bought a Medium; I wear an eight mostly for my booty, but these were pretty small all around."
"These are true to size and don’t roll over like some high waisted shorts. The pockets are deep enough to hold my phone without it constantly slipping out. I would definitely purchase again"
"I've ordered like 5 pairs.  They are SUPER comfortable and so enjoyable to wear.  I have them in multiple colors and the black is definitely a staple.  Works great with cropped shirts too."
"Like the headline says, this is my 3rd time ordering these. I really like the way they fit me and they are good for everything from lounging, traveling, working out, and running. The zip pockets work well and hold my larger phone and keys. The zips are good to keep everything is place and make sure they wont fall out during activities. The material is soft and from my use, durable. I have swam in them on a whim during a hike and they dried fairly quickly without any fuss. Inseam is fairly accurate and fit me well."
"They quality feels good so far, they fit nice, pockets are deep enough for your phone to comfortable slip into, thickness feels similar to what even Nike would use and they are very lightweight! I'm 6'1"" 237lbs and I bought an XL. Definitely buying again."
"So the grey shirts are darker in person. The clothing dries fast. Not too thick but not very thin. The pockets are wonderful. They are breathable and the fit is good, I would say they are worth the money."
"The only thing I don’t like about these is the draw string is very long, it actually hangs out the bottom of the shorts. I had to tie it in a knot to make it shorter."
"I bought a 2 pack for yoga (black/blue). The fit very well for yoga. The 5” short has some stretch to it, making them perfect for exercise. But, they look great for casual wear as well. I bought another 2 pack dark/light grey. Definitely buy again."
"When compared to the average pair of Nike or Adidas shorts, this 2-pair deal is very tempting. Especially since it comes in many stylish colors, has lots of hidden pockets, and is made with that coveted 5 inch inseam. But after a measly three months of use in the gym, these shorts started to tear apart at the seams (literally). From the back butt seam and the side seams, these shorts were rendered unwearable within a few weeks. So while these are a good deal, I won't be buying them again...and again...and again; I'd rather invest in a higher quality brand that lasts many months and years."
"Bought for my son. They fit and wash well. True to size. Very nice quality. Will definitely buy again."
"I found the first set of these on TikTok shop, but it took too long to ship and so I switched to Amazon to purchase. These are great quality and they are inspired by the other brand that shall remain nameless. My two year-old son wears a pair every day."
"The shorts are light weight and stretchy. The inner layer compression shorts stay snug but not too tight.My iPhone kept falling out of the left pocket when I worked out on machine at the gym, so I added a stitch to the pocket opening and now it holds my iPhone with no problem.The right rear zipper pocket is too small to hold a wallet."
"Love these shorts. Good quality with relatively good compression. Maybe not as tight as I would like but that’s my fault. Regardless they are comfortable and I will be buying more for my running journey."
"If you are looking for affordable workout shorts this is the one.I use them for running, gym, and soccer. And this shorts does it's job.Good thing about this is the inner liner make you comfortable since you don't need to wear underwear, so it feels aligned with the pants. Also, the phone pocket keeps your phone in place. But it is not super tight pocket, so it may slip out if you do a lot of jumping.The outside material are like basketball jersey like texture so stretchy and breathable. Back pocket has zippers to keep keys and small items safe, but the side pocket are shallow and doesn't keep the items inside. (That's why I deducted 1 star).But overall it is a great workout shorts, and if you are looking for one that you want an easy wear to the gym or a quick jog, you should give this a try.Thanks for reading my review and hope it helps with your shopping!"
"Purchase for my son who plays sports. Uses them for practice. Came in plastic bag. Fabric is stretchy , thin, lightweight, and comfortable for movement. He loves the side pocket for his phone or earbuds. Not transparent at all with 2 layers, came in several colors and he has about 3 of them."
"These fit great and are super comfortable, BUT the pockets are so super small. The only deep enough pocket is on the tights side, BUT that just fits my phone.I love walking around my neighborhood and the other pockets are not big enough for my wallet or my keys. And the zipper pocket in the back is only big enough for chapstick. Weird.  I think zipper pockets in front would be nice so that at least I felt confident that nothing would slide out. These are kinda a bummer."
"These are amazing. They make me look forward to gym! Haha so stylish and comfortable"
"These are just as good as the running shorts that go for $60/$80. They’re stretchy, soft, good spandex length plus has two regular pockets, towel pocket, back zipper pocket for like a key and then the thigh spandex pockets. They looks great too."
"I like these shorts and have purchased other styles but with different patterns and colors. The material breaths well and does not get hot. The only downfall is the outer shorts material can easily snag, that's why I only use them in or for the gym."
"Smart of ya  to read reviews. Before purchasing. If you are a medium you must buy LARGE - they didn’t show the maxi pad at the back pocket in any pics  - why wasn’t that fluorescent instead?! Short quality is ‘meh’ but passable."
"The quality of the material is ok. The drawstring is useful. However, the base Lycra liner is somewhat loose. It doesn’t fit snuggly so when I run with my phone in the liner pocket, the phone moves way too much around. I own another pair in the same size ordered from a different place and that one fits fine."
"I bought these for my partner in the summer time before this cold weather started kicking in, and he still wears them around the house this fall day. They’re breathable, lightweight, and not tight. They seem durable, no holes or zipper malfunctions. Id definitely recommend them and I’m sure he would too lol"
"I’ve been wearing under $20 shorts to the gym the last 3 years. For a few extra dollars, the comfort is well worth it. Very light weight and feel well made. Hopefully they last awhile. Highly recommend for running or working out at the gym. Great colors too."
"Love how lightweight and comfortable these shorts are!!  The elastic waist band is a little tighter than I would like for the size, which is why I am giving 4 stars.  If you are between sizes, I would recommend sizing up.  The pockets are deep and have a zipper closure, which is really nice if your doing an activity and need to keep something in your pocket.  The fabric is breathable and is a nice light gray color.  They can be worn for just about any purpose, but are most ideal for physical activity or sports.  If they get wet or sweaty, they do dry fairly quick since the fabric is thin."
"I bought 2 shorts for my grandson and he’s tall and big!  I found that the quality of this shorts were amazingly tough!  He said it was comfortable and cool!  So I bought 2 more shorts and he is super happy with the shorts!I would recommend the shorts for anyone looking 👀 for quality and awesome workmanship material, it’s durable!❤️🙏😉"
"Comfortable, quick day and stylish, a great fit and greater buy"
"Nice color, but feels like it’s cut right around the waist. I have similar shorts, and they fit perfect.The pockets have zippers. Very nice feature. Very breathable fabric.This brand seems like the waist was cut a bit too small. If not for that, I’d rate them 4 or 5 stars."
"The shorts are so comfortable and stretchy! I recently started working out at a gym and the quality and fit is greatI actually went to buy another pair after enjoying this so muchHighly recommended"
"This review covers the 5 or 6 colors of these i've ordered.All fit well. I really like the zippers on the pockets. Has a back zipper for a phone on most of the models i've ordered.I wear these as a cargo short alternative. I was so happy with my first (orangish) order that i bought several colors.Highly recommended."
"I recently purchased the Adidas Defender 4 Medium Duffel Bag, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. As an avid gym-goer and frequent traveler, finding the right bag to suit my active lifestyle has always been a challenge. However, this duffel bag ticks all the boxes and has become my go-to companion for all my adventures.First and foremost, the quality of this bag is exceptional. The materials used are durable and built to withstand the rigors of daily use. From the reinforced base to the sturdy zippers, every aspect of the bag exudes durability and reliability. I have put this bag through its paces, and it has held up remarkably well, showing no signs of wear or tear.The size of the bag is perfect for my needs. The medium-sized option provides ample space to fit all my essentials without feeling bulky or cumbersome. Whether I'm packing my gym clothes, shoes, and accessories, or using it as an overnight bag for short trips, there's always enough room to accommodate everything I need. The main compartment is spacious and easy to access, allowing for hassle-free packing and unpacking.One feature that sets this duffel bag apart is the thoughtful organization. The multiple zippered pockets and interior mesh compartments make it a breeze to keep my belongings neatly organized and easily accessible. I no longer have to dig through a cluttered bag to find what I need. The side pocket is particularly convenient for stashing smaller items like keys, wallet, or phone, ensuring they're within reach whenever I need them.Comfort is another key factor that impressed me about this bag. The adjustable shoulder strap is padded and offers excellent support, making it comfortable to carry even when the bag is fully loaded. The top handles are also well-designed, providing a secure and comfortable grip. Whether I choose to carry it over my shoulder or in hand, I always feel confident and at ease.I can't overlook the stylish design of the Adidas Defender 4 Medium Duffel Bag. The sleek and sporty aesthetic is right up my alley. The iconic Adidas logo adds a touch of authenticity and sets it apart from other duffel bags on the market. I appreciate that it effortlessly combines functionality with a fashionable look, allowing me to transition seamlessly from the gym to other casual settings.Lastly, I must mention the excellent value for money this bag offers. Considering its outstanding quality, durability, and versatility, the price point is more than reasonable. I feel like I've made a smart investment that will serve me well for years to come.In conclusion, the Adidas Defender 4 Medium Duffel Bag has become an integral part of my active lifestyle. Its durability, ample storage space, thoughtful organization, and comfortable design make it a winner in my book. Whether I'm hitting the gym, traveling, or simply running errands, this bag has proven to be the perfect companion. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, stylish, and functional duffel bag."
"This bag will hold clothes for a weekend or serve as my catch all carry on bag for flights. The material is sturdy, repels water and has a section to hold shoes, dirty laundry or damp clothes. The bag is larger than I expected but what I needed.Great bag and a value for the money."
"I bought this bag for short trips when lugging around a suitcase didn't make sense. The medium size is definitely spacious enough for a few days on the road. The material is sturdy and it is fashionable. The only complaint that I have is that the zipper pulls ""jangle"" quite a bit and are noisy. This is a minor detail; however, I bought rubber zipper pull covers and now it is a non-issue."
"I love the size, and the color of this bag. It is definitely nice looking and good quality. I bought it for my soon to be 14y/o son to have for boxing to hold his gloves, towel, extra clothes, boxing shoes, mouth guard, water bottles, and an extra pair of sneakers or slides. As he grows it is roomy enough that he will be able to hold more inside like head gear, and more equipment. He also uses this bag for weekend trips, and could use it for an even longer vacation as it could fit multiple clothing items, self care items, and a couple pairs of shoes. Easy to clean, functional, lightweight, and comfortable to wear."
"I really like this duffel bag. It seems sturdy and durable with plenty of space. It also seems somewhat rain resistant, which is a bonus for sure if you are using it as a referee bag like I am. That being said, the side pouch zippers need to be a double zipper type instead of the single zipper in the current design. Having to open the side pouch from the bottom of the bag (where the zipper ends in a closed state), facilitates spilling out items from pouch when opening it. The main compartment is fitted with a double zipper, and side pouches should be as well."
"Love the colour (brown) and functionality. Sturdy yet lightweight. Separate shoe section is a bonus. Good for overnighters/carry on."
"This bag is perfect for adult sized skates, hockey helmet and a pair of gloves with lots of space to spare. The bag seems well made. I hope the zippers hold up. I don't currently use the shoulder strap but I have it tucked into a pocket in case the need arises."
"I bought this to use for road trips but ended up using it for everyday use. I really like it."
"Review for Small Gym Bag for Women, Travel Duffle Bag Carry On Weekender Bag with Shoe CompartmentI recently purchased this small gym bag, and it has quickly become my go-to for the gym and short trips! The design is sleek and stylish, perfect for everyday use without being bulky. The dedicated shoe compartment is a game-changer, keeping my shoes separate from my clothes and making it super convenient to pack and stay organized.The bag is surprisingly spacious for a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù size, with plenty of room for gym essentials like a change of clothes, water bottle, and even some toiletries. There are also multiple pockets inside and out, which is great for keeping smaller items like keys and phone accessible and secure.As a weekender or carry-on bag, it works really well ‚Äì I was able to pack everything I needed for a two-day trip. The material seems durable, with sturdy zippers that glide smoothly. It also has both a shoulder strap and handles, so it‚Äôs comfortable to carry in different ways.Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase! It‚Äôs functional, versatile, and stylish, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small, practical gym or travel bag."
"Great bag, it's small but fits everything I need. I really love the color, extra pockets and I was surprised by the quality. I thought it was going to be thin material but it's sturdy and thick and better than I expected. I usually go to the gym ready to workout so in my bag I bring a towel, pj's to change into, lock, hair brush and a plastic bag to put my dirty clothes. I carry my shower caddy and water bottle separate. I still have more room to add more items if I needed but I usually don't care more than that."
"This is a decent size bag and fits all of my gym essentials. Can easily fit in the lockers at my gym. The only fault is that I wish it had a sturdier bottom so that it would hold its shape a little bit more."
"The bag was very pretty but it was very cheap. The zippers don't work very well but I will keep it. I guess you get what you pay for."
"Very roomy with lots of pockets, but not too big or bulky to carry. Seems very well made and sturdy. However I ordered the ""purplish red"" color, which looks burgundy on the picture, but it is very much purple. Not a problem as I love purple and it is still very stylish!"
"While this bag is pretty, It is not sturdy or durable enough for every day gym use. I have used it for about a month and a half and within the first 3 weeks the shoe compartment tore and is unusable now. The seams near the zipper are also coming undone. I do not overload my gym bag either, so not sure why it would not be durable. I do appreciate the small wash bag that comes with it, I use it to hold my travel size shampoo/conditioner."
"Color is cute, very good size for a carry on. Almost got more in this bag than I did in my luggage. Lots of pockets, very sturdy, holds alot of wight. If you think you don't need a separate waterproof compartment for shoes trust me, you do."
"Unfortunately the inside ripped after 2 uses. The quality just isn‚Äôt there. The wash bag is nice and well made, but the bag itself was a bit disappointing."
"Much nicer than I thought it would be. Ideal size (got a small), materials are rugged, seams are sturdy, zippers are smooth, waterproof zip compartment is large, zip compartment for shoes is handy. Higher overall quality than I expected for the price."
"The build of this bag, the shoe compartment, wet items pocket, and internal pockets for wallet / keys/ etc are all anyone will ever need for the gym. The strap is padded nicely (I carry weight plates to the gym) to feel good on your shoulders. The price is exceptional. So glad I didn’t spend the excess for Nike / Adidas / UA. You’re literally paying $20 extra dollars for the name. I got the small bag to carry my gym clothes, sneakers (size 10-men), two 5 ib-weight plates, headphones, a towel, flip flops and deodorant and had plenty of room. Small fits in my gyms lockers perfectly."
"Most duffle bags for hitting the gym are always way too big and make me feel awkward and weird.  This carries a full change of clothes for me, a towel and makeup wipes, my makeup and hair brush, and a pair of shoes perfectly.  I always shove my sweaty clothes in the workout shoes side pocket after I change so the main compartment doesn't start smelling gross, and the small mesh side compartment is perfect for my sweaty gym towel to air out.  It's perfect for what I need."
"Excellent quality material, metal zippers, “wet pocket” for wet clothes, fits in gym lockers well, perfectly compact. Very happy with this purchase overall."
"This bag is well constructed with heavy fabric and smooth zippers. It comes in two sizes and, unless you're headed for a short weekend, the small size makes more sense for a gym bag. The separate shoe compartment is a nice addition, as is a plastic lined  ouutside cmpartment for those sweaty post-workout clothes. Four stars because the large size is somewhat unwieldy unless full."
"This bag has a wet pocket with thick plastic water barrier, and a shoe pocket. It’s not to big and not to small, the size is perfect! I just think I made a great choice when I bought it!"
"This is the best gym bag, because the bag has a separate compartment for the shoes. We all know gym shoes can leave everything in the bag smelling like them. with this separate compartment you don't have to worry about smelly shoe scent on your clothes. It also has additional compartments for your phone, keys, water, etc. A great buy for the price."
"This bag is very well-made. It has metal versus plastic and all of the zippers work very well. It is the perfect size for me because it fits in a small gym locker."
"It's what you expect. Good product."
"Bought it for my daughter's sports activities. The bag holds her shoes, extra pair of clothes, a basketball, wet clothes and everything else in between. Extremely handy and well made. A good bye to the hundreds of bags and sacs to carry different things..."
"It looks smaller in the pictures. It is much bigger and heavier than expected.But it is durable, and well made, so it will definitely hold up. I think I bought the last gym bag I will ever have to buy."
"Great size! Easy to use and perfect for work, gym, short trip"
"Very sturdy and nicely made! Zipper good, roomy, high value for money!"
"Wow, this is beyond my expectation, I'm so happy with it.  I wanted to get a little duffle to fit on top of my smaller carryon luggage for an international trip.  This would be used to carry all the extra stuff that I want close at hand at my seat, and this can easily be shoved under the seat.  I can also put my purse in here too just so that I'm not managing too many things.  The material is a very high end looking canvas, not thin nylon or thick army issue so it's sturdy enough but not flimsy.  It's got unisex styling!  Size to true, this fits right on top of my luggage without any spill over.  If I find something I like, I go back and buy more and I submit a 5 STAR review for this!  Zippers are well made and the shoulder strap is a plus.  I'm not a backpack person either when I travel!  (When on the move, my purse/wallet will be under my shirt!)"
"SImple, but good smaller sized bag (fits a typical towel, flip flops, water bottle and misc).  Quality seems good (used for 1 month).  Outside pocket is very small, not big enough for a cell phone.  Inner pocket is good size and could fit phone."
"My son needed a duffel bag for his gym clothes. He brings them home every week for washing and this bag is the perfect size. Everything fits and its not too bulky. He isn't easy on his things and it has held up beautifully."
"Fits more than you would think. Zipper is durable and doesn‚Äôt get caught. Reasonably priced. I spilt coffee on it and it beaded right off."
"Nice size but handle broke off the first time it was used."
"Very durable, easy cleaning fabric, strap is wide and very durable, perfect color, plenty of pockets,the portability is great, performance is perfect for cheer, workout, great for travel caryon"
"I love the size of this bag and it makes for a perfect gym bag; it fits the essentials and also packs easily into a locker.  It seems to be well made and the two zipped pockets are useful for keys and other essentials."
"I bought this bag for my brother a couple of months ago and the quality was as shown in the photos. Now, i decided to buy for myself and the bag i received is not the same as the one i ordered for my brother.The quality is rubbish, it feels like paper, the bag does not sit straight and when you put things inside it, it does not hold. Save yourself money and don‚Äôt buy.I‚Äôm guessing they have changed suppliers and the quality is absolutely horrible. The brand name is not even on the zippers as it is on my brothers bag.I will be returning my bag."
"I recently purchased the Travel Duffel Bag, Sports Tote Gym Bag, and it has quickly become my go-to bag for all my travel and gym needs. Here’s why I absolutely love it:The first thing that caught my eye was the chic and versatile design. This bag effortlessly transitions from a gym bag to a stylish weekend tote. The sleek lines and modern color choices make it perfect for any occasion, whether you're heading to the gym, a weekend getaway, or even as a carry-on for flights.The bag boasts an impressive amount of storage space, with multiple compartments to keep everything organized. The main compartment is spacious enough to hold clothes, shoes, and toiletries for a weekend trip. Additionally, it features several smaller pockets, perfect for organizing your essentials like your phone, keys, wallet, and gym accessories.The build quality of this bag is outstanding. It’s made from durable, water-resistant fabric that can withstand the wear and tear of frequent travel and daily use. The sturdy zippers and reinforced stitching give me confidence that this bag will last for years to come.Comfort is key, and this bag delivers. It has both sturdy handles and a detachable, adjustable shoulder strap, allowing you to carry it in the most comfortable way for you. The padded strap is particularly great for longer trips, reducing strain on your shoulders.Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a frequent traveler, or someone who just needs a reliable, stylish bag, this Travel Duffel Bag is perfect. Its versatility and functionality make it an essential piece for anyone looking for a quality bag that can do it all."
"Nice and big. Hold lots of stuff and has plenty of pockets. Has a waterproof pocket also. Durable and I love the color."
"I got this for travel.  I used it for a trip to CA.  I really like it.  It's roomier than it looks.  I like how well it fit under the seat in front of me, I still had room for my feet.  I was able to access cord for my phone,  my jacket and pillow easily in flight.  It has an internal wet pocket.  It was easy to carry around after my luggage was checked.  It has a strap/sleeve that fits easily over the handle of my carryon, rides nice on my carryon.  The quality seems good.  Wish it had a more heavy duty zipper but so far it hasn't been an issue.  I would buy this again."
"I absolutely love this bag. It holds more than I anticipated. It is sturdy, easy to clean, stores away easily when not in use. I live that it will ride on top of my suit case securely. Good quality."
"Pro- size. I bought this for a week trip, it was perfect size for flight travel! I was able to put a lot of stuff in here. Also has many pockets with zipper. Strong too. Good bag.Con - it feels heavy to carry and walk around. I expected it lighter since it’s fabric but it is feels heavy even when it’s empty due to waterproof material. But I love the size of bag so I kept it."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



This bag is solid! The zipper seems fine, the fabric is durable, the waterproof pocket is great, the shoe storage on the bottom is amazing (holding all three pairs of shoes that I'm going to need on my trip). The trolly strap of your luggage handle is sturdy. The pocket to hold your boarding pass is wonderful. I do wish the very front pocket had a means of securing it, it'll work for a momentary place to set your phone, but I wouldn't keep it there for any length of time as it might either fall out or be snatched up by a slick pickpocket. I don't have any of the unfortunate issues that some have had. I ordered because of there being so few people with problems compared to the total number of bags purchased and high numbers of seriously happy customers. I figured with so many bags sold, there's bound to be a few with issues, but the odds of getting one with problems is low, and with Amazon's easy returns and exchanges, it was worth the risk. No other bag had 31,000+ reviews let alone high number of reviews and high rating. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"A great travel bag for the weekend or for the gym. It fits a lot, the color is great and the manufacturing is also"
"I bought this bag to put in my suitcase for any gifts and extras I might buy while on vacation. Instead, I used it to replace my backpack. It holds a LOT, has inside and outside pockets, is light weight and strong, has a shoulder strap and shorter carry handles. It has a trolley strap that was really convenient, too.  The price was less than half of the heavily advertised competitor, so I say this bag is a winner.  I'd buy another."
"Absolutely love this duffel bag. The spacious interior makes it perfect for a weekend getaway or a gym session. It’s stylish, durable and sturdy. Love that there is a wide range of colours to choose from and the feature where you could slip it into your carry on luggage."
"This bag is cute and Light. Nice for trips to the pool and park etc"
"I used this product for my workout sessions. It was of perfect size with a section to pack my sneakers. It could even hold my towel to use to dry off after the pool session. Material is good for the usage and the bag was easy to use and handle. The colour was just what I wanted. The style of the bag was the right fit, not too big or too small."
"Has ample space for such a small bag. I was able to fit my clothes, shoes, a towel, and water bottle. Good gym bag."
"Nice bag. Good size. Seemed pretty tough, nice logo. Overall very happy with it"
"Got it for soccer. It' big enough for shoes, a ball, and shirts, but not ungainly big. Like the outside pocket for wallet, phone, keys (a key hook would be a nice addition). One side pocket could probably hold two pairs of shoes, the other side is smaller and a pair of shoes won't quite fit.Fabric is lightweight but appears durable, zippers are smooth. U shaped top opening gives good access.Good bag for the price."
"Bought this bag to replace another puma bag i had for years. This is a good bag and has a lot of room for all the stuff I take to the gym with me daily. The only concern I have is that if the bag is too heavy by the long strap, it’ll tend to rip a little. Overall good bag for my gym needs."
"I am loving this bag, it is the perfect size for taking to the gym, I am really loving the shoe pocket, I can fit both my gym and shower shoes in it at the same time. The big pocket holds my clothes, shower kit and a bath size towel and still has room to spare. The smaller pocket is perfect for holding my padlock and key for the lockers, and my headphones when I'm not wearing them. The other pocket holds my phone, wallet, brush, keys, hairbands, protein bar and it still has room for more without bulging out. The bag has been holding up great, the shoulder strap is not annoying and does not dig into my shoulder. My only issue is that it is about 1/2 inch too long for the lockers at my gym so I have to stand it on end but I blame that on the gym lockers not the bag."
"Great bag perfect size to take to the gym will order one more"
"For about a year now, this duffle bag has been my gym buddy. Its style is appealing and I've even snagged a few compliments. The size is just right, not too big or small, and the compartments are well thought out - especially the one for shoes, which I find particularly useful.However, I did run into some issues. The zipper occasionally gets stuck, which is a bit concerning as I don't want it to give up on me in the future. The material, while appearing decent, is a bit on the thin and stiff side, which might explain why it feels slightly less durable. In fact, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't hold up well if I were to pack in heavy stuff.Despite these hitches, the bag still serves its purpose for light gym use and stands out in terms of style. Therefore, I'm giving it 4 stars. It's not flawless, but it's been a solid gym companion for me."
"You will love it when you use it"
"Very nice bag at half the price (or more) of other sport bags.  Good quality and good size.  Although the dimensions were not mentioned, I took a chance, and was delighted.  This is a perfect (if not more) weekend bag, student bag or gym bag.  We are using it to carry my son's football equipment.  It fits his large bulky helmet, his cleats and 2 huge insulated water bottles.  The side pockets fit his small towel and accessories such as SPF, hand sanitizer, keys..etc.  With all that, we don't even need to force the zipper closed, and I'm sure we can squeeze in more.  Only downfall, the shoulder strap is not padded.  Although it is not mentioned and not shown in the pictures, I decided to ask this in the Q&A..and recieved a response that it is padded.  However, it is not, and the description and pictures were exact.  Great bag though, so we are keeping it anyway.  If you absolutely want a padded shoulder strap, you can purchase one separately if in time the bag proves to be uncomfortable.  So far, we do not have much weight in it and only carry it for minutes at a time."
"I purchased this for my son, who is in 2nd grade, and is playing basketball for his first season. The bag suits him perfectly and he loves the design, space it provides for all of his equipment, and how light it is when carrying. Overall, If you're looking for something easy to transport, prioritize affordability, or relish hands-free carrying options, this duffel bag could be your perfect travel companion."
"Didn‚Äôt have any problem with stitches and the quality is okay but I also believe that material is not the best. I am happy with the compartments. The size is larger than what I expected but I‚Äôm happy overall."
"Great bag, good quality, decent size"
"This Puma Gym Bag appears to be of good quality for the price (note: I purchased on a sale) and is very spacious. It is light and convenient, with many useful pockets and straps. I am very satisfied with its functionality so far.The quality of shipping itself is one of the poorest I have ever received from an Amazon order. The bag was free floating inside a cardboard box that was so horribly damaged during shipping that the tape sealing the box had mostly broken. The box barely remained intact enough to keep the gym bag from falling out on its own (picture of the box's condition upon delivery included). Shipping was also extremely slow, taking weeks. Absolutely appalling shipping service but the bag seemed to be undamaged, fortunately."
"It was a gift for a friend and he loved it. He uses it for the gym and is sturdy a d looks nice."
"This is a fantastic, spacious gym bag with plenty of room and compartments for all your personal items and gym essentials. It easily fits all of my martial arts gear‚Äîand then some!"
"Really good duffle bag, perfect for traveling. Not too big not too small. And price is amazing"
"This bag has a high end look to it. I am not sure about the sturdiness of it as yet because I have just received it but the shoe compartment is spacious and more than adequate. My 9 year old son loves it already"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Quality there i bought it because someone else did the video this guy deserve money thanks bud !"
"Very good quality and good price."
"The bag squeaks a little when I wear it which can get annoying but honestly it’s a great size for gym bag and can carry several things at once like shoes, clothes, boxing gloves and toiletries. It’s great for traveling too. Love the color and look! If you take care of it it’ll hold up well without looking dirty (which I always worry about with white or beige colored things)."
"I’ve had many name brand gym bags and this is the best in quality so far - and for the price! Love the vented shoe pocket, strap is comfortable and sleek look for carrying into work."
"I loved this bag, really spacious and beautiful color, i use it for the gym and sleepovers"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I opted for the small and for my needs it is just the right size. Plenty of room for my towel, bathing suit, shoes, change of clothes, bands, water bottle, and other gym equipment. I like that it’s waterproof, makes it easy to clean. I also like the simple style and the bungee on the side is perfect when you need a little more space. I haven’t used it long enough to comment on how durable it is, but will update if I have any issues."
"this is the first bagsmart product I’ve bought, and I am not disappointed! the quality is amazing for the price, and the deep green is a beautiful color. it’s held up wonderfully over time, so it’s durable. I use this bag for my figure skates and all necessary accessories (hard guards, gloves, screw driver, lace tape, etc) and there is plenty of room for everything. the pockets on the inside and outside make it super easy to organize all my things. the strap is also sturdy and comfortable. bagsmart is now my number 1 go to for bags!!"
"Prefect size. Use it mainly for the gym. Great bag to have."
"I bought this bag last year to use as a gym bag, in off white. Super cute! I still use this bag almost daily for the gym and travel and it's in great condition. Comfy and great material that thick. Easy to clean- I just throw it in the washer. Spacious- has a shoe compartment, insulated/wet bag, plenty of pockets/compartments to keep everything tidy. For those price point, this bag is a steal!"
"Has so much space and fits so much. Perfect for the gym. I initially ordered because i wanted to be able to fit a gym outfit and my work uniform for when i go in the morning or after work."
"this bag is wonderful..it can fit everything you need plus more..the durability so far seems great and its easy to carry."
"Use this product for travel purposes. Kept a lot of clothes packed and has lots of room."
"I got it for my nephew and he loves it is a good size it fits lot of stuff in it I‚Äôm going to order another one for me"
"not thin material that will rip on you it feels nice its one layer but its pretty thick its a decently sized bag thought it might be too small it wasnt"
"Perfect gift for kids who are into sports."
"Needs more pockets."
"It is exactly what was advertised so I‚Äôm happy üí™üèæ"
"Good I like it, good size for the gym"
"Bought this for my son's lacrosse bag. Works great I enjoy that I can place his shoes in the side pocket"
"It's super great looking and very roomy!!! Love this bag!"
"This product came at a reasonable price, it's absolutely game changer for my busy schedule. After long days at the office I have a quick efficient bag that has many compartments for my beats headphones, my shoes, and a bigger compartment to hold clean towels, clothes and other stuff. Also noted it is slighty waterproof I took it inside the gym shower because I don't trust leaving it in the room changing areas so it kept my clothes dry even after getting spritz with water while I showered. Should fit in deep lockers horizontally or vertically in small ones. Great buy. Thanks"
"I like this bag. It‚Äôs durable and does the job."
"I really love this gym bag! It has enough space for everything I need for the gym; it fits a towel, change of clothes, shoes, and hygiene products! I also enjoy that the product is waterproof so I can use it at the lake and pool as well."
"Spacious and stylish. Perfect for your gym items."
"It‚Äôs durable and I use it so much"
"It‚Äôs a good gym  bag spacious with enough room for all your gym stuff and space for anything else you need to throw in without it looking bulky‚úîÔ∏è"
"Not only is it super cute, but it‚Äôs also great quality! I love the colours and it has a little compartments that are really useful. I suggest getting it, whether it‚Äôs for a weekend getaway duffle bag or for the gym! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
"Sometimes you need a small duffel. Check the dimensions (14"" x 9"" x 8.5""). It is small (smaller than most) but perfect for: squeezing a locker at the gym or school, fitting below the seat in front on an airplane, tossing under the bench at a game, etc. It is the size of two shoe boxes (one on top of the other). It can hold one basketball/soccer ball, a phone, a small towel and a couple of drinks. It can hold one change of clothes, toiletries and a pair of shoes. It certainly is small but perfect for the right use. Our #1 choice for taking to sports games.There are color options to make it easier to find or suit your taste. Does not look like it is for kids.  Simple, elegant look.It is not the strongest. It is for lighter use or occasional replacement. Don't over-stuff it and expect it to last.That said for the price and the right purposes...it is perfect. Very useful to have one at home.Note: We were not compensated in any way for this unbiased review."
"I bought this I bought this mostly because of the low price.  We use this as a sports bag for kids. we got the first one when our child was a five year old girl and we wanted a bag for dance class and it has grown with her. She’s now eight and we have bought multiple of these bags so her and her brothers sports items for each activity so we don’t have to constantly shuffle stuff between bags for activitia.so we don’t have to constantly shuffle stuff between bags for activitiesImportant to note, these are completely soft, sided and soft bottom and there’s no plastic insert or anything that inherently keeps the bags shape to stand up on its own. important to note, these are completely soft sided and soft bottom and there’s no plastic insert. There are no interior or exterior pockets except for a mesh exterior. That doesn’t do a very good job of holding a water bottle because the pocket is too short but it’s great for storing a small item.there are no interior or exterior pockets except for a mesh exterior.

"This little bag is great for the gym as well as for an overnight bag! I’m able to store my gym needs and it’s sturdy plus the material is thick. It’s also really cute!"
"The PUMA Kids' Evercat Transformation Duffel Bag is adorable and great for kids! It’s a bit smaller than I was expecting for a duffel bag, but it’s the perfect size for little ones to carry their belongings.The design is cute and functional, and it’s just the right size for sleepovers, sports, or weekend trips. If you're looking for a kid-friendly duffel bag, this one works well!"
"Got this for my son and daughter it’s perfect for an overnight bag , great quality great value , storage capacity is best for kids things or you could fit one to two days of cloths for an adult if you really needed to and when your not using it it folds up nice and doesn’t take up space"
"Great quality and perfect for a gym bag"
"Small and yet still spacious and also very fashionable"
"Bought it for daughters swim practice. Small and roomy enough for her age! Wish there’s an inner pocket so she can separate her goggles and swim cap, but no big deal, using a ziplock now. Great value!"
"Holds a lot and easy to carry for kids. Grandkids loved them"
"this is good for a kid but Good"
"I got this as a replacement for my daughter‚Äôs old string backpack and I like that the material has some durability to it and that the ‚Äòstrings‚Äô are thicker and soft so they don‚Äôt dig into your shoulders. The plain colors are perfect for school as is the zipper pocket in the front. Big enough to hold everything essential but small enough to carry from class to class."
"I purchase these every year for a teen outreach program.  They are very sturdy and have a great color selection."
"I do A LOT OF MUSIC FESTIVALS, and these bags are perfect. They fit the size and pocket requirements for most Music Festivals, and it's not going to fall apart at the seems like the free-bee bags that you gets that look like these. These have thick ropes, and knots. Along with thick material and sewn sides. This is exactly what I was looking for, so I bought 3x for all my adventures."
"I wanted an inexpensive bag for carrying extra stuff on my ebike. This is a nice size, looks durable, and was a good value. There are fancier ones out there that might have more features but this one is certainly ok for occasional use. Will easily hold a raincoat, lightweight bike jacket, lunch, small bike tool kit.Not so much for camping or hiking where you need more stuff."
"This is really a great little backpack. It‚Äôs canvas and it‚Äôs not nylon. So it‚Äôs more sturdy. Has a zipper on the front and the straps are good. I would recommend this item for errands and trips and whatever. Great for the beach too does not pick up sand or water. And I love the red color!"
"so, the bag is great quality, it‚Äôs thick and seems durable, the strings are really nice, they look like they won‚Äôt get tangled or hurt you or break off easily. They fit my basketball shoes, they fit my change of clothes and i could probably fit in a refillable gatorade bottle in there and STILL have extra space to put something in there. I used to own a tiktok shop black drawstring bag and the holes to loop the strings would break and it would be a whole mess but this is definitely athlete‚Äôs approved! I recommend this bag, i bought this bc of the good reviews, free 2-day prime shipping and yeah. It‚Äôs great, better than buying a $25 nike drawstring bag. Sorry for the yap hope this helps."
"Bag was better quality and large size than expected for the price."
"This is an excellent bag to use with a wheelchair. It‚Äôs flexible you can hang it on the candles and it hangs perfectly away from the wheels. It‚Äôs sturdy. The rope straps are strong. It stays closed. Highly recommend."
"Been using it for over a month, took it various places, had lots of items in it and it still holds up very well."
"I just love it. I'm putting it through hell and it holds up amazing."
"This bag was super useful and worked great until 2 days in and a giant hole formed on the side of the bag. The seam from the bottom edge to the middle split. Luckily I spotted it before heading out for the day or all my items would have fallen out throughout the day."
"Bag is very hard and shoulder straps are very soft and comfortable. It is good."
"It would be great if the back had a skeleton structure or something at the base to help it sit on the floor properly. It's just a flat piece of fabric with no shape, making it awkward to place on the floor as it tends to fall over randomly. Also, an exterior pocket for quick access to essential items would be useful."
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this bag in person - I go away for work often and needed a bag to hold a week or two worth of clothes and toiletries. This bag has SURPASSED my expectations! Everything fits very well, there is a good sized pocket for shoes - I can put 2 pairs, there is a wet zipper pouch, the bag is well made, the option for carrying is AMAZING - Backpack, duffle bag, or handle bag, and the bag is really nice looking too! Performed well on two trips already and the different carrying options makes it easy to load! I will be ordering one for each of my sons for vacationing too!"
"Plenty room for shoes, shower shoes, towels, clothes, ect. I like to use this as a backpack  instead of duffle bag."
"Excellent bag with a lot of useful pockets and storage areas. I like the build quality. Only downside is to be mindful of the size. I purchased the 40 oz bag and it’s smaller than I expected. I’m not sure if the size includes all the side pockets but it’s fairly small"
"The bag was a little too big for what I imagined it to be. But other than that it is a really good bag."
"Dimensions are as described. Quality is great. Most people use this for a weekend or gym bag. I plan to use it for a 5 day trip and so far am able to fit the necessities for that long of a trip. Nothing extra. Love the backpack or duffel option. Use as a carry on no issues."
"Fits alot and multiple carrying options"
"I bought this duffle bag expecting to upgrade from my old one. Received the product and the backpack clips did not clip together. Requested a replacement and they sent me the same thing but half the size, basically child size. Not worth the hassle buying this product because they clearly have no quality control. Terrible manufacturing, waste of money. Not to mention my old beat up bag fits more than this brand new one which is LARGER in size. Not worth the money."
"Purchased as a father day gift for my hubby who is getting back into the gym life.He absolutely loves this bag! It has so many useful components. He is able to carry size 13 shoes in the shoe compartment. A microfiber towels a change of clothing size XL (so the don't fold up small) his Chromebook laptop + charger & mouse.In the smaller zipper waterproof pouch he carries full stick Deoderant small shampoo bottle and a full bar of soap.He has a place for his phone and a 32oz water bottle! TThe bag has a side zipper pouch that he is able to fit 2 large bottles of vitamins plus his lunch in!He uses it for short overnight trips but mostly the gym.It is a fantastic bag! He loves the versatility and the fact that he has the option to Cary it as a backpack or over his shoulder!Highly recommended 👌  no issues with seams hoping or bag tearing so far and he has over stuffed it for a week long trip!"
"Love this bag. It has a compartment for just about everything and the design is amazing. I have had bags with “shoe compartments” before but I have a bit above average sized shoes and usually they never fit. This bag comes in and I come to find out they added an extension zipper for the shoe compartment and finally I have a bag that actually fits my shoes. The bag itself looks better in real life than in the pictures (rare for Amazon products). It is super lightweight yet very durable, so far it’s the best gym/ travel bag I have owned.Update: the only thing that could use improvement is the zipper quality. They get stuck a lot and seem like they won’t last very long. Other than that it’s a great bag"
"I’m don’t write reviews unless I really like or dislike something. Used it for a couple of weeks. This bag is high quality, the stitching is firm, the compartments and zippers are ideal for keeping things organized and it’s just really nice and different. I had an Adidas bag that fell apart. Very much recommend this bag for the price."
"Needed a new GYM bag and this works great. Love the expansion feature and all the space."
"This gym bag has lived up to what has been described it is a very durable bag and looks great!"
"This duffle bag/backpack is heavy-duty. The material feels like it will be durable and has multiple ways to carry it. The bag is already hefty without any items in so I can see this becoming super heavy. I like all the zippered pockets and the small travel bag."
"Very nice gym bag, it’s padded with tons of compartments to stay organized! Seems well made and love hot it expands if I need extra space!"
"The pockets, design, straps and space is excellent. The velcro for Personalization in places to put hooks are great. I.Am worried about how long the zippers are gonna last one.Already broke where the zipper doesn't properly stay. With one already going worried how the rest are going to do especially with it being on the main pocket for the bag. Would have let another direction if I knew it would have broke this early.Otherwise a great bag."
"I love its functionality, I’ve ordered several other gym bags but they all came short. This one was definitely worth kissing so many frogs until I found the right one."
"I like my new gym bag. It has a separate pocket if I decide to swim. Wet and dry compartments. Pretty cool. Also fits perfectly in the gym locker. Great bag."
"Been using this bag for almost two years now. Maintain the bag when using and it'll last you longer than you think. Great material quality. Hope this helps."
"My husband loves this bag. He uses it for the gym, but it could be used for traveling or anything else. It holds all of his stuff and even has a special spot for shoes so that they don’t touch anything else."
"I use this for softball, the gym and overall light travel. This bag is durable, high quality, and very nice. Brings back my military vibes but doesn't fall apart like Mil-Spec! Definitely grab it."
"The bag construction is a thick sturdy fabric with Molle straps all over the outside which makes attaching other gym items to the outside convenient. Side shoe compartment which can be collapsed from the inside for max internal storage capacity. Front zipper pocket small items, right side mesh pocket which is good enough to carry your water/protein bottle and two internal pockets (i) open pocket (ii) zippered pocket.SUGGESTIONS For Improvement which would score 5-star rating1) Add 1 inch full zip pocket to the right side (before the mesh pocket)2) Inside open pocket, expand width and make into two compartments"
"Needed a bag for a two week work trip that wasn't a Sea Bag. Straps are strong, good pockets. I love how it has a separate pouch for shoes, etc. That you can not use if you want and it's seamless!"
"I use the back for my work clothes after I do PT in the morning. I live too far from work to go workout and come back and shower. I bring all my stuff and the bag is perfect size, with the perfect amount of pockets. The shoe compartment to keep my shoes and clothes separate and why I bought this. Perfect."
"I needed a good bag to replace my other gym bag. I thought, TACTICAL b/c I love molle. And I do have extra velcro patches. Good price.Strong build. I had a buncha tools in it, maybe 20 pounds. Fine and sturdy. Didn't even realize it had the shoe portion aka 2A and 420 compartment. It's a thin separation so it can get out the way."
"I bought this bag to modify and fit as something to keep on my bike. This bag is very durable and can fit so much inside it. Survives through all weather. I fully load this bf with tools, medical equipment, etc. Quality buikd is amazing. Strongly recommend. Just wish it was waterproof. But it takes a long time for it to get wet inside while raining"
"The bag's quality is superb, it's sturdy, highly functional, particularly for shoes, and most importantly, its design is excellent.It's been a while since I've been so pleased with a product on Amazon."
"I'm a student who practically lives out of my backpack, carrying everything from textbooks and laptops to food, clothes, and even a mini medical kit. Finding a bag that can handle it all was a challenge, but this bag can do it!!Here's the good:- Dual Functionality: It seamlessly transitions from a spacious duffle bag to a comfortable backpack, making it perfect for any situation.- Padded Straps: Unlike some duffle-backpack hybrids, this one has well-padded straps that make even the heaviest loads feel manageable.- Ample Storage: This bag is seriously roomy! I can easily fit my 15-inch MacBook, food, headphones, daily essentials, medical kit, shoes, and a change of clothes without it feeling crammed.- Durable Construction: The material feels sturdy and well-made, giving me confidence that it will last for years to come + water resistant up to a certain level. It gives a good cover for my stuff when I'm caught out in the rain.Minor Concerns:Carabiner Connection: While the carabiner connection at the bottom seems secure so far, I can't help but worry about its long-term durability. Hopefully, it proves to be as reliable as the rest of the bag.Past Experience: I bought a similar, black color, backpack a while ago. However, it's zipper had broken within a year. Regardless, I found that I still wanted it so I decided to take extra care when I'm using the zipper. I think I just happened to overload it previously.Overall:Despite my minor concern about the carabiner, this bag has exceeded my expectations. It's comfortable, spacious, and versatile, making it the perfect companion for my busy student life. I even used it for a weekend trip recently, proving its adaptability beyond everyday use.Value for Money:This bag is definitely worth every penny. It was for me. While I wish they offered a warranty (especially considering my previous bag's zipper issue), the value it provides in terms of functionality, durability, and comfort outweighs that minor inconvenience. I'm confident I'll be using this bag for years to come!Highly Recommend:If you're looking for a duffle-backpack hybrid that can handle your day-to-day needs and even weekend adventures, look no further! This bag is an absolute steal and I highly recommend it to students and travelers alike."
"I absolutely love love this bag period durable waterproof and tons of storage.Not to mention, these drops are comfortable when you put it in backpack mode. The quality of the product is excellent. The zippers actually have seams over the top of them, so they don't catch or snag on anything"
"Very spacious. I wish the wet bag was larger. It's very good quality. The zippers are nice and thick. I love that there's more than one way to carry it and it's not complicated to switch from one way to the other."
"Pros: good amount of room, versatile carrying optionsCons: water bottle pocket too small, some pockets too narrow, could use more interior organization.Wanted a big enough bag that I wouldn't need to move items in or out depending on what I'm doing - I'm able to fit my weightlifting, climbing, and swimming gear in this bag all at the same time. Though it's roomy, IMO the bag has the bare minimum required to be functional in terms of organization. The layout of interior pockets/external dividers is sufficient, but I would have liked additional internal pockets or perhaps one of the bigger pockets split into two.The bag itself feels fairly durable in terms of construction - the fabric feels thick enough to withstand constant use and all the stitching/attachment points seem solid.This bag's biggest flaw is that the water bottle pockets are not the same size. I use a 40oz stainless steel vacuum bottle, and it only fits in one of the pockets (the one used when in backpack mode). If I want to carry this bottle in duffel bag mode, I need to either shove it inside the main compartment where it takes up space or strap it in sideways in the 'backpack mode' pocket with an external strap - both solutions that I can live with, but find annoying.I do also wish that some of the pockets (particularly the external pocket on the back of the bag) were a bit wider - if I try to put anything too thick in there it causes the pocket to bulge and makes closing the zipper difficult.There was a surprising amount of room in the bag - I'm able to fit all of the following at the same time, which in my opinion fills the bag to about 90% capacity:- Two chalk bags- Weightlifting shoes- Climbing shoes- Thin hand towel- Regular size bath towel- Weightlifting belt (velcro style)- Two pairs of knee sleeves- One pair each of knee wraps, wrist wraps, and wrist straps- One roll of athletic tape- Small bottle of liquid chalk- Swim trunks- Swim cap- Goggles- 40oz water bottle- Small misc. items like extra contacts, lotion, a headband, etc.One small issue when I first got the bag - one of the clips on the detachable shoulder strap was sticking when I opened it instead of springing closed. After about 5 minutes of forcefully opening/closing the clip I managed to clear out whatever obstruction was causing the issue and the clip mostly functions fine now unless I push the clip open with a good amount of force.Overall, this bag seems solid and meets almost all of my needs. A couple of tweaks would have made it perfect, but I suspect this is as close as any bag will get."
"I’ve had this bag for over 6 months and it’s hands down the best gym bag I’ve had. So many pockets and compartments, I always have a spot to put things. Love the shoe pocket, if I don’t have my shower shoes in there, it’s great for putting dirty clothes in since it is separated from everything else in the bag. Its quality and finish is great, I toss it around and it does not even have a scratch. No zippers have broken. Love that it turns into a backpack as well, also making it a great travel bag.I rarely leave reviews but one of the straps broke and I messaged the seller if I could get a replacement and they sent it no problem! So I figured I had to leave a review for the awesome customer service!"
"After extensive research, I finally settled on purchasing this gym bag, and I must say that I am thoroughly satisfied with my decision. The quality of this bag is exceptional, and it offers ample storage space, allowing you to effortlessly fit all your essentials. Despite its generous capacity, the bag maintains a compact exterior, especially when utilizing it as a backpack, making transportation remarkably convenient. Alternatively, the included strap provides another versatile carrying option.Furthermore, this gym bag is impressively lightweight, ensuring ease of use and portability. It even features a dedicated compartment for storing shoes, further enhancing its functionality. Notably, the bag's stylish design adds a fashionable touch to your gym attire.Overall, I highly recommend this gym bag, as it surpasses expectations in terms of quality, functionality, and style. Considering its reasonable price, it undoubtedly represents the best gym bag I have ever owned. It is a worthwhile investment that will undoubtedly enhance your gym-going experience."
"Wonderful and efficient bag for daily use."
"Over all bag is good, But it should have better quality handle"
"First impressions.  This is a great value bag, the clincher for me are the shoulder straps so I can carry the bag whilst riding to the gym.  The compartments at each end are very useful and it is just big enough for a change of clothes, towel, toiletries etc.  it seems well made, looks good  - I chose green- and it has no logos which is a bonus for me."
"This bag is very inexpensive but well designed. It has lots of pockets, the shoe pocket works great but what I was surprised to love best about it was the small extra bag that comes with it.  It's such a perfect size to hold phone, keys, earbuds and couple of things I need in the gym (cable ankle strap, resistance band, face towel) that I haven't taken the full bag into the gym yet!  This was a great purchase, highly recommended!"
"I love this gym bag I‚Äôve had it for about 3 months it‚Äôs perfect. Many compartments for me to separate my gym gear. Very sturdy and I love the yoga mat place holder. Wish it had a shoulder strap thou."
"I've had this for a couple of months. I take it to my Pilates and Yoga classes 5 days a week.  It still looks good. Holds up nice. Is not dirty. The water bottle pouch is so convenient.  My 32 oz canteen fits in it perfectly. It has gotten a little dirty though. Still worth the purchase."
"I have finally found the ultimate gym bag solution with this gem that includes a convenient water bottle bag. Let me tell you, this bag has truly exceeded my expectations in every aspect :) ‚ù§Ô∏è The quality of this bag is good, I have no doubt that this bag will stand the test of time, no matter where I go. What sets this bag apart is its thoughtful design with multiple compartments. I can effortlessly organize all my gym essentials, and the dedicated slot for my iPhone 16pro (for reference) is just the cherry on top. Knowing that my phone is safe and easily accessible adds an extra layer of convenience to my workouts.But what really puts a smile on my face is the versatility of this bag. It seamlessly transitions from the gym to travel. Its stylish yet functional design makes it a perfect companion for all my activities, bringing both practicality and flair to my daily routine. In conclusion, this gym bag has become an indispensable part of my active lifestyle. If you are looking for a reliable, well-crafted bag that can keep up with your diverse needs, look no further. I wholeheartedly recommend this bag to anyone seeking a blend of quality, style, and functionality in their everyday carry."
"best gym bag ive ever had , it has so many compartments and is spacious yet not overly huge and is super fun to carry around. The price is great for the product!"
"Very nice quality and stylish"
"I got this gym bag because my old one was ugly and barely held anything. This bag is very cute and it holds a lot! There are so many compartments and storage areas to hold many different things. There is even a yoga mat strap for you to hold your yoga mat. The only thing I wish with that was that you were able to take it off if you‚Äôre not putting a yoga mat there because it kind of gets in the way. Other than that it‚Äôs a great bag and it‚Äôs very easy to take anywhere because it doesn‚Äôt take up that much space. Not to mention it comes with a water bottle satchel with a zipper pocket on it if you just want to take your water bottle!"
"i use tis bag to hold all of my gym supplies and it‚Äôs terrific!! i also took it on a trip and used it as my carry on. if fit very nicely on my suitcase ! it holds plenty!!"
"This isn’t just any bag; it’s the Swiss Army knife of duffle bags, and I’m pretty sure it has more features than my last smartphone! At first glance, it looked like an unassuming bag, but as soon as I opened it, I knew I was in for a wild ride.First off, it’s huge! I mean, we’re talking enough space to fit my entire gym wardrobe, a snack stash for a small village, and maybe even my dog (not that I would take him to the gym—he’d just judge me for trying to lift weights). This bag can hold everything you need for a workout, plus those questionable protein snacks that I swear taste better after a solid lift session.The compartments? Oh boy, it’s like a treasure map! I can keep my sweaty gym clothes separated from my fresh, clean gear (because who wants to smell like a gym sock all day?). And there’s a pocket for my shoes, which I’m convinced was designed specifically to contain the shame of my last-minute decision to hit the treadmill instead of the couch.Now let’s talk about the style. This bag is slick! It’s got that “I’m here to crush goals, not just the treadmill” vibe going on. Strutting into the gym with this beauty slung over my shoulder makes me feel like I’m starring in my own action movie—complete with dramatic music and slow-motion hair flips (even if my hair is more ‘windy disaster’ than ‘Hollywood glam’).The durability is impressive too! I accidentally dropped it out of my car while getting my stuff together (don’t ask), and it landed with a thud that would’ve sent lesser bags crying for their mamas. But the Sports Duffle Bag? It just shrugged it off like, “Is that all you got?” If it can survive my clumsy moments, it can survive anything!In conclusion, if you need a gym bag that can hold everything from your gym gear to your dignity after that last set, the Sports Duffle Bag is the perfect pick. Just be prepared for it to become your new best friend—because let’s be honest, it’s way more supportive than my workout buddy who always wants to ‘take it easy’!"
"Big bag, with Decent material, little thin but good for kids sports and gym sessions. Good bag for the price."
"Got it for my Grandson to carry his martial arts gear, uniform etc.Does the job very well."
"Have had gym bag for a few months and part of handle already coming apart ...not of the best quality!....UPDATE: After posting this review on the bag's handle quality, the seller reached out and sent me a replacement bag..now THAT is excellent customer service!"
"It is well constructed I like the size, I love the quality.It holds a lot more than you would' think it is used everyday to go to the gym. Very nice for the price"
"It's smaller than I thought it would be but it's a nice small gym bag"
"Liked the price. Probably still worth it. I just noticed that have a few weeks of use, the inside of the side pocked is tearing apart. The zippers also stick but that actually seems to have gotten better with time. You can tell its cheap material, but I concluded that you get what you pay for and it still works. My LL Bean one lasted for 30 years, no comparison. After 30 years it was still desirable enough for someone to steal it on the subway. No one will steal this one at least."
"I'm really impressed with this gym bag's design - it's black with vibrant orange highlights. It offers plenty of space and features pockets with durable zippers. Plus, there's a special compartment for my shoes. The straps and handles feel very strong.The only downside might be that the material of the bag is a bit thin. While this keeps it lightweight, I wouldn't use it for heavy items. However, it's ideal for carrying clothes and other gym essentials. All in all, it's a stylish gym bag that I plan to use for my lighter items like clothing and shoes."
"This gym bag is long in width (20.87"") and about square (10.63"" x 10.63""). The quality of material is good and the zippers work well. I like that it has a strap that could hang the bag onto a luggage handle. Thus it  is good for travelling. The shoe compartment is made of waterproof fabric. It comes with a shoulder strap. It is useful when carrying bulky stuff but not too heavy, like clothing and shoes will be very good. I am happy with it. Would recommend."
"Nice Bag with storage options, the shoe compartment is nice because it doesn't have to take up any space if you don't need it, but it gives a separate compartment for shoes or dirty laundry that is also vented.  The pictures in the listing show most of the features, overall very happy with it.  We'll have to see how it holds up, but it looks good."
"I bought this specifically because i wanted to have a bag that can fit in a locker, a bag that i can store my lunch, my scrubs and work-shoes/clogs, a bag that i can easily strap on the back of my motorcycle, etc.It looks small but it really can hold many things and is so useful.The quality is nice, it looks great, the zippers work and it just basically an all around duffel bag that can be used for many purposes be it the gym, a sleepover or in my case as a nurse bag for work.Shipping was quick, product came well packaged. Definitely worth the buy."
"Love this bag I use it all the time at the gym. Small but fits everything I need including a pair of sneakers, towel and extra clothes to change. Looks good too."
"Bought this for my daughter for her track season to carry all her stuff and multiple pairs of shoes. Great quality bag and held up to everything she put it through, definitely enough space to hold everything she needed, including her meds, inhaler k tape etc. When she needs a new one we will definitely be getting another one for her."
"Little small but is great for my husband work bag"
"This is a great bag for the price. Well made but it definitely is made more for a kid and not an adult. Probably my fault for not reading the dimensions."
"Great size , even small enough for over the top on plane . (Carry-on size)"
"This is a great little duffle bag. I bought it for my golf shoes and a few other odds and ends that I need for the course. I liked it so much that it quickly turned into my weekend bag."
"Quality is good. True as descriptions."
"Lovely design & compact.  Ideal size for my partners work bits & lunch box etc"
"It’s the perfect size to fit in a gym locker but still fit workout clothes, normal clothes, shower sandals, a small towel, and stuff in the pockets. It’s been durable for a lot of use, it looks good, there are tons of useful pockets but they also don’t get in the way of the main compartment. The only thing I don’t like is that there’s no shoulder cushion for the strap and also the strap can flop around, but I fixed that with a rubber band and I guess I don’t need a shoulder cushion that much. I don’t know if I’d use this for travel, would probably be just a little small for that."

"I LOVE this bag. I used it daily for the gym, and as a powerlifter, it is roomy enough to hold my squat belt and miscellaneous items without buying an XL gym bag. I have also used this for traveling on work trips, and this has served as a great carry on. It has a sleeve so it can sit on top of your suitcase while moving through the airport. It has enough pockets for easy organization. One side of the bag works as a shoe storage, and the other for your water bottle or phone. I’ve had this for months now and have tossed this in and out of my car and around hotels and gyms. Very durable. There’s been no problems with the zippers or the material ripping with time. 10/10 bag"
"This bag came in quickly. The bag itself is a great size, not too big and not too small. It has great space for your shoes, clothes, and workout equipment. The material is good quality and the zippers are all perfect. There are pockets and spaces to place keys, gloves, earphones etc. Really great purchase I am happy with."
"his is hands down the best gym bag I’ve owned after months of searching. The Peacock Blue color perfectly matches the photos, and the material feels sturdy and well-made. The design is stylish, and the bag is comfortable to carry, whether in hand or over the shoulder. The numerous pockets allow me to organize everything, from wet clothes to personal items like my phone and charger.However, I do have one suggestion for improvement: the shoe compartment. While it effectively separates my shoes from other items, the bottom of the bag could use more structure. When carrying heavier items like shoes and sandals, the bag can lose its shape. Despite this, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others"
"I'm a firefighter and work 24hr shifts, sleeping overnight at the station 3-4 days a week. Needed a bag that would hold extra clothes, toiletries, Tupperware/food, and some gear; this bag fits EVERYTHING with no problem. I carry a lot with me, and still have not achieved filling this bag to the max. Looks are deceiving, because when it first arrived it looked small. But this can hold SO MUCH. It's fantastic! The side compartments are so useful too. 10/10, highly recommend this bag, either for travel, work, daily commute, etc. Easy to grab by the two short handles or by the strap. Love love love!"
"10/10 would recommend. Needed a new gym bag, this one is great quality for the price (zippers, fabric, straps are all strong). Love the numerous pockets. Extra perk: lovely colors to choose from—I chose the dark green and it looks exactly like the photo."
"Great color and perfect for the gym. I love the shoe compartment and the lined inside pocket for dirty clothes or things that might leak"
"My kid was begging for these shoes and I finally gave in, they are super cheap for what they are and I honesty want them for myself. The quality is great, she wears them in PE and outside playing, true to size and the style is great for any outfit. The color doesn’t ware or tare and they aren’t very heavy while walking. Great purchase!"
"These sneakers are super comfortable and look good with jeans, leggings or even a casual dress.  They do run about a half size big.  I am usually a size 8 but went with a 7 1/2 after reading reviews and so glad I did.  Still roomy and comfortable."
"I absolutely love these shoes. Very high-quality perfect value for the moneyThe comfort is perfect and they are true to size. I always worry about flat shoes since I have a high arch, but my feet are so comfortable with or without socks.They are so trendy I’m gonna buy more colors!"
"I love these - they’re stylish and comfortable and make me feel like I’m not 100 years old but also not trying to be 20. I wish the shoestrings weren’t quite so long - I have to double knot them and they’re still pretty long even with the knot."
"This shoe is very cute and confortable. It does make your feet feel a bit wider, but I have no problem with it that. It’s also on the heavy side, and it doesn’t have the most flexible sole, so I don’t recommend it for very long walks. It does look very nice with shorts, dresses or pants, and it’s built well. Fair value for a great quality shoe!Quick shipping also tops it up! Buy it!"
"These are very comfortable and they go with everything.  I wear these a lot to work and they are holding up.  I clean them with a damp cloth and they look like new again.  Only negative is that they do run slightly big in length, not in width.  I would size down a half size to 9.5 if I buy again."
"These shoes are so cute and versatile! I want to love them! BUT right out of the box I am not finding them to be comfortable at all. In face they’re a bit painful. The top doesn’t flex when walking so it feels like it’s trying to remove my big toe at about the halfway point.  I suffered through day 1 hoping that I was breaking them in. They’re too cute to give up on yet… I’ll keep you posted."
"I got these to replace a different brand that I had worn out.  I wear them to work and they feel great on my feet.  The heel has great cushioning and I love that around the bottom isn’t white.  I ordered my normal size and they fit perfect."
"Comfy and classy"
"Love the fit and color. Great price!"
"Fit perfect for size. Fun to wear. Classic style."
"Well made good fit comfortable Was well worth the long wait to arrive It’s my go to walking shoe"
"These shoes are comfortable, cute, and a perfect alternative to other expensive shoes on the market (sambas). Love them"
"Last month I purchased these Adidas shoes that have completely transformed my daily strolls. These shoes epitomize comfort and style, making every step a dream.Comfort: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü The cushioning in these shoes is unparalleled. The memory foam insoles provide excellent support, molding perfectly to the shape of my feet. I've only used it on the pavement; my feet feel like they're walking on clouds. The arch support is also fantastic, reducing any strain on my feet and lower back.Fit: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü These shoes fit like a glove. The adjustable laces and flexible material ensure a snug yet comfortable fit without any pinching or discomfort.Durability: üåüüåüüåüüåü After four weeks of almost daily use, these shoes show no signs of wear and tear. The soles are sturdy and provide excellent grip, even on slippery surfaces. The upper material is breathable yet durable, keeping my feet cool and dry.Style: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Not only are these shoes incredibly comfortable, but they also look great. The sleek design and variety of color options make them versatile enough to wear with any casual outfit. I've received numerous compliments on them!Overall: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü If you're in the market for a pair of walking shoes that combine comfort, durability, and style, look no further. These Adidas are worth every penny and have made my daily walks something I look forward to. Highly recommended!"
"So far, I have worn them about a half a dozen times. They seem well-made, attractive and fit very comfortably. I have small wide feet and got the size 9. The Tow box seemed perfectly wide and roomy for me. If they hold up, I‚Äôll probably order another pair. Looks like a very good value for the price."
"Got these for my son. True to size. He really likes them and says they feel great! They look nice too. Just as the picture shows. No complaints. We‚Äôd buy these again."
"I like the color and there are very comfortable to my feet nice pair of shoes to have in the collection"
"got this for my bf and he loves it. Its true to size and the colour is as the photo"
"These shoes are comfortable. I ran a 5K in them and use them for practice runs. So far so good!"
"These shoes look great and are very stylish. The sole is soft with light padding, making them comfortable to walk in.However, they seem to run small. For reference, I typically wear a size 11.5 US in Nike Air Force 1s, but these feel extremely tight on my feet. I recommend going half a size up for a better fit."
"I love these shoes, very easy to keep clean and very comfortable, great walking ability too."
"Little small size,but good comfort."
"I bought these sneakers expecting nothing less then terrific. Never have I been disappointed in New Balance sneakers. I bought a black pair of the 608s, I've purchased numerous styles over the years always stylish and  fit comfortably. These shoes were shipped promptly, received as described, nice quality shoe. The shoe fits perfectly, extremely comfortably and affordable. No breaking in period required.  Thanks New Balance."
"Fitz well, quality of the lather is good and comfortable. Color came clean and style is really good."
"I want shoes I can wear to walk 2-4 miles around my hilly neighborhood regularly that also are styled in such way they can be worn with most of my casual outfits- no crazy patterns or color schemes. I haven't had a pair of New Balance sneakers in a while but decided to try them again. I have trouble finding sneakers I like the look of that come in my size 10.5 (many brands just skip from 10 to 11), have the support my feet require as I am an over pronator, and are on the wider side of 'regular' width. My feet have annoying Goldilocks tendencies where it's hard to find 'just right'. These sneakers fit the bill! Right out of the box, they felt supportive and solid, very comfortable. I wore them to run errands for a few hours and completely forgot I had new sneakers on just about immediately. I couldn't be more pleased.with these,.without even the dreaded 'break in' period."
"I do like that they are black with a non-slip soul, which is very important when you work in the kitchen around food. They are comfortable, but I wish they were a little wider. I did order a wide, but it is a little tight on 1 foot I am hoping that the leather softens up and it will be OK but it is a comfortable shoe."
"I've been wearing New Balance style 608 training shoes for more than 20 years, and they never disappointed me! With more and more fabric athletic shoes on the market, it's really hard to find a good pair of training shoes that still have leather upper and provide good fit, support, traction, cousining, stability, breathability, and yet still relatively lightweight, with such a good price! Plus they look pretty and classic! They are also easier to clean compared to fabric shoes.  Thanks to New balance who's still making style 608 so we can continue enjoying our training fitness in these fabulous shoes! Please keep up the good work ðŸ’ªðŸ’¯ðŸ’ªðŸ’¯ðŸ’ªðŸ’¯"
"Mom loves these! She says they are so comfortable and the perfect fit!"
"The style is cute, they do provide traction and they are made of leather. However,I suffer from severe foot/heel pain, suffer from planters fasciitis and these shoes , although okay craftsmanship do not work for me! They do not have much of an arch.Admittedly, I ordered the 8.5 wide because I have inserts and thought the extra width would help. It did not.These shoes probably would work well for anyone who doesnâ€™t suffer from foot problems but if you are looking for an arch supportive shoe, these  did not work for me."
"I always have great luck with New Balance shoes.  They are comfortable, true to size. Good quality and lasting.  Excellent price value this time because I got a great deal on Amazon Prime Days and this makes it even better!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Absolutely LOOOVEEEE my new black running shoes! But please get them 1/2 size smaller for your foot, there is A TON OF CUSHIONING and stretching. Right out of the box, these shoes felt like they were custom-made for my feet. The cushioning is exceptional, providing a perfect balance between support and softness. Iâ€™ve completed several long runs, and my feet have felt great every time. The traction on these shoes are INCREDIBLE. Whether Iâ€™m running on pavement or a trail, the grip is reliable and consistent. They handle sharp turns and sudden stops without any issues, making them ideal for a variety of running environments.EXTRA: After weeks of intense use, they show minimal signs of wear. The materials are high-quality and seem built to last, which is impressive considering the level of comfort they provide.Overall, these black running shoes have exceeded my expectations in every way. Highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable, stylish, and comfortable pair of running shoes!"
"good quality  and strong materials."
"The shoes are perfect - although I donâ€™t have them.I didnâ€™t have a pleasant experience with the seller. They sent the wrong size and in the end I returned the shoes with a lot of hassle."
"Got these for my grandson and they were nice and comfortable. Perfect fit and lightweight. They look good and can be worn when he goes out."
"I’ve been eying these up for a long time.Very comfortable, super light, they have so many different colors, but I went for simple navy.The only con I can see is that I’d like to tighten up the laces a little and it’s not the end of the world but a little fiddley with the elastic."
"Hey Dude shoes combine lightweight comfort with laid-back style, making them perfect for all-day wear. Their flexible design and cushioned insoles feel like walking on clouds, while the easy slip-on style keeps things casual. Ideal for anyone looking for shoes that blend effortless cool with unmatched comfort! We love HEYDUDE Shoes!!"
"Hey Dudes are all the rage right now and I’m starting to understand why. These shoes are great for everyday wear. They’re also great for wide feet. They offer lots of space in the toe box, are very lightweight and are easy to slip on and off. The only improvements that could be made would be to offer slip resistance, as they had no traction against my vinyl flooring. I also wish they were easier to tighten but the elastic laces look silly when they stick out of the sides too much after tying an extra knot. Overall, these shoes are very comfy and I like them, but I do feel theyre overpriced for what you get."
"Still comfy but more of a shoe than what my other pair is."
"Good quality"
"Incredible. Very fun to wear and so comfortable top to bottom. One of my favorite shoes"
"I purchased these as a Christmas gift. They were delivered in 2 days.  I'm sure the teenager will love them.  The price was great and I already know from word of mouth of friends and family; that the product has 5 stars!"
"The Skechers Women's Go Walk Joy Sneaker has become my go-to shoe for daily errands and long walks. After weeks of use, I can confidently say these sneakers live up to the hype.

It‚Äôs perfect for casual wear, light exercise, and anyone who values comfort over heavy-duty durability.Summary:The Skechers Women's Go Walk Joy Sneaker combines comfort, style, and practicality in one lightweight package. While it may not have the durability for intense use, it‚Äôs an outstanding everyday shoe for walking and casual activities. Highly recommended for those seeking all-day comfort!"
"Do I dress like a grandmother?  Yes, I do.  I don‚Äôt wear heels, because they are very uncomfortable, expensive, and downright weird.  I wear my dresses and skirts pretty long, and love the look of a clean white sneaker upon my feet, especially when they are so lightweight and comfortable.  they are great with your jeans when you are running to the grocery store, and look just as great sitting in church.  These are true to size, durable, and easy to keep clean - just throw them in the washer."
"I need a shoe that has stretch on the top portion of the shoe to accommodate the bone on my foot. I found these shoes and it is all I wear. It feels like I am walking on air. I cannot express how much I love these shoes. They run big so I purchase one size smaller than my regular size and they fit perfectly. You will love them!!!"
"I have very narrow feet, so finding a comfortable slip-on walking shoe is not easy. I also was looking for something that did not resemble an athletic shoe. After some research I decided to try this shoe for a trip. Originally I was just going to wear them through the airports, but instead ended up wearing them for the entire trip, which entailed a lot of city walking. The shoes are very comfortable, sort of like wearing house slippers everywhere. They are also understated enough that they fit well with a business casual look. However, even through these were sold as narrow, they are wider than I like. Still, they are so well-constructed that they did not slide around too much and I could not walk out of them; also, even though a little looser than I expected, they did not rub and leave blisters. However, if you need a shoe with more arch or ankle support, they are probably not for you. After a week of constant use, they also still look good and the soles do not show wear."
"Very lightweight! Easy slip on and off,Looks cute and is also very functional and comfortable.Wore it with socks so not sure about blister? But is slip resistant too."
"Oh wow! I took a chance and ordered these. Because I don't usually order shoes online. And I am so glad I did! They are extremely comfortable.I can wear them all day long. I ordered nine and a half narrow which is a half size larger than usual, but they fit perfectly. They are mesh on top, so don't expect them to be waterproof.But I do think they give a nice firm footing, and I love them."
"Best shoes ever!! So lightweight yet good support. Slip on nicely. Do not need ""breaking in""!!! Comfortable immediately! Love so much I bought another pair and will again!"
"shoe is super lightweight and very comfy.  Not as much arch support as I would like/need.  Just recovering from 8 months of plantar fasciitis so I'm a little keen on wearing the right shoe.  I just wear these around the house so they work great. I do recommend that you give them a try and the fit is right on."
"Size is correct."
"I feel like I‚Äôm wearing slippers. These shoes are slip on easy and very comfortable."
"I was worried these would look nerdy for Disneyland but they were perfect! Super comfy, my feet didn’t hurt at all either day I wore them and I wore them ALL day at Disney. I have a very wide foot and they are true to size. Great support. Super nice quality. And they were easy to wipe off and keep clean!"
"This is my 7th pair of Skechers memory foam shoes! I keep buying them because they are so freaking comfortable! Sizing is spot on and let me tell you, they will last for two years at least! And the foam is like walking on a cloud! Definitely worth the price!!! I've had the blue ones, pink and black and now white ones and they all were consistent with the wear and tear on them. Of course the white get dirty quick. I did order wide width just because I like a little room in my shoe. They mold to your foot in no time and will be your fave pretty quickly!!! Definitely will order again!"
"The Skechers Women's D'Lites Fresh Start Mem sneaker is a fantastic blend of comfort and style. As someone who spends a lot of time on my feet, I appreciate the lightweight design and cushioned insole. The shoe provides excellent support, making it perfect for both casual wear and light exercise.The retro-inspired design adds a touch of vintage charm, while the modern colorways keep the look fresh and trendy. The shoe is true to size, fits comfortably and slip resistant.Overall, the Skechers D'Lites Fresh Start Mem is a great choice for anyone seeking a comfortable and stylish sneaker that can be dressed up or down."
"Cute with a little bit of sparkly silver accents. These are very comfortable and have good arch support. Good fit as any Skechers to me. The leather quality is good and durable, but the initial stiffness of the leather makes the shoes feel bulky. I guess I have to wear them more and break them to feel more like my shoes. I feel that I can walk more stably when I’m wearing these which is a plus."
"These Skechers fresh start memory foam lace ups are comfortable and the insoles are very spongy. The souls themselves give when you move on them. So your heel doesn't hurt. However, the shoes run too small for someone who doesn't have a pointed foot. In addition, when wearing athletic type socks that are cushioned, the shoes are too short as well. There just isn't enough room for active use.So, I had to send these back and I ended up getting men's shoes that are wider. A 6 1/2 man's regular is wider than a woman's 8 wide, but about the same length. My advice to my wide footed friends is to pass. But if you have narrow feet and your toes are not splayed but more pointed, these shoes will probably be very comfortable for you. Again, if you have an athletic foot and wear thick, cushioned socks then you might wanna go with a man's shoe. So for some people this is going to be a very comfortable shoe. The rubber soles and the foam insoles will be nice and forgiving, forgiving on your heel or when you step on a rock.The shoe is attractive and some versions are not leather. Additionally, the angle of the shoe with the higher heel is also adequate and will probably help you if you stand on your feet for a long time. I would recommend these shoes but only for some people. Happy days."
"I only buy these shoes. They are nice white shoes that go with everything/ comfy and offer arch support. They are washer safe and easy to clean. And last for a long time, I wore them everywhere and everyday  for an entire year before they began to really wear down."
"I love these shoes. They fit great and don't hurt at all. They also look great. They have sparkly little round things next to the laces that really dress them up."
"I've bought these in different colors. The design changes a little bit but they are comfortable and good quality true to size"
"I was wary to buy a pair of shoes on Amazon but given the high ratings, and the fact they reminded me of the Dr.Scholls memory foam runners I used to buy, I decided to take a chance. Im glad I did!They are very light weight but well made, the memory foam makes them soooo comfy!! They are true to size. I think I have found my new pair of running shoes and I definitely would repurchase these. My only complaint is I feel like the back by the heel could be a little higher for more support , but that’s probably just because what I’m used to.I love these sketcher d’lites!! Buy a pair, you won’t regret it."
"Looking good and comfortable 😍"
"The size was not what I usually wear. Making the shoe smaller than before"
"I recently purchased the Skechers Women’s Hands Free Summits Dazzling Haze shoes for my elderly mother, and they have been an absolute game-changer for her! These shoes are perfect for anyone who wants comfort, style, and convenience, especially for seniors who may have difficulty bending down to tie or take off their shoes.Hands-Free Convenience: The standout feature of these shoes is the hands-free design.

"Great shoes!  Comfortable fit true to size and easy on and off with no hands."
"Great feel, easy on and off. Looks great feels good."
"After recent knee replacement, I needed a good pair of sneakers for rehab & recovery. Comfort, sturdiness & slip-on features were a must. These fit the bill in every way - I now LIVE in them & just ordered a 2nd color. Only bummer, the style is older so just 3 colors available. On the bright side, the price point is excellent."
"They’re a bit on the narrow side, but they are comfortable and easy to get on if you have mobility issues"
"I purchased the black shoes with black soles.  The shoes provide support for walking and have been comfortable from the first day.  They are versatile for traveling.  Since the shoes and soles are black, you can wear them for evening events.  They are light weight and washable.  I find them to be true to size.  I have a pair that I have worn for three years for yard work, and they are still in good shape.  I recommend the shoes."
"Over the course of the last year I have tried on numerous pairs of slip on shoes.  After purchasing some at an excellent price at Walmart, I really wanted another pair that fit just a little better so I didn't have to touch the heels at all in order to get the shoes on.I used Prime Try-Before-You-Buy several times to try the Sketchers Slip Ons and never could find a pair that would really work.  They were all either too wide or too big or too small.When these were offered at a great price for Prime members ahead of Black Friday 2024, I took another chance.  And I'm so glad I did!  These slip ons go right on, without me having to touch anything on my feet!  They are wonderful!  Even though I got a blue pair, they are so great and feel so good,  I don't care if I wear them with a black or brown outfit!!  I'm wearing them!All around, these are excellent shoes!  A+++++"
"I debated these vs. other hands free sneakers that were twice as much $.  These work perfectly fine. I like how you can slip them on without using your hands to quick take out the trash or drive a child to school last-minute.  They are pretty comfortable as well.  I wore them for a weekend walking around Salem MA doing 2 walking tours while pushing around a friend who was unfortunately in a wheelchair on endless cobblestone sidewalks.  My feet didn't start hurting until after several hours/ miles of walking on the main day.  Highly recommend!"
"Great slip in sneakers no bending down to put them on.  I like the design and very comfortable.  Wash well in the washing machine."
"These shoes fit very well. Extremely comfortable right from the first day I wore them. They are great to wear all day walking in. There seem to be no breaking in period.I highly recommend these, true to size, shoes."
"Great shoe! Super comfortable and so easy to slip on and just go! And fits great! Love my Skechers!"
"Very comfortable and light.It’s very easy to slip in and out as they advertise.I’m very happy with the shoes."
"The Skechers Men's Nampa Food Service Shoe is a comfortable and durable option for those working in the food service industry. Designed with a slip-resistant rubber outsole, these shoes provide excellent traction, helping to prevent slips and falls in busy environments. The memory foam insole offers all-day comfort, while the smooth leather upper is easy to clean, making it a practical choice for anyone on their feet for long hours.These shoes have a sleek, professional look, while being lightweight and supportive, ensuring both comfort and safety.Overall, the Skechers Nampa Food Service Shoe is a reliable, functional, and stylish choice for those needing a comfortable work shoe for demanding jobs."
"Seem like good quality, typically Skechers work shoes hold up a good long time, and I am HARD on shoes.  Lots of time working and walking on concrete floors, tons of stairs, etc.  comfort, support and long life are always top of my requirements.  Non-slip is a good bonus.These seem to run a little narrow, or my usual shoes run wide maybe??  Either way I usually wear a size 10 in Skechers work shoes, but these in size ten were too tight in the toes and longer than I needed.  9.5 extra wide was perfect.  Super comfortable right out of the box."
"This is a great work shoe. I bought these for my boyfriend and they've held up great. Their perfect for working in a restaurant kitchen, the slip resistant sole works like it should and their not overly heavy. They are comfortable enough to have on for long shifts and give enough support so that your feet don't hurt at the end of the day.Only complaint is that the sides of the inner sole fell apart somewhat quick."
"I get these for my son for fast food service and they seem to take daily abuse for about 8+ months before any sign of failure and he says they are comfortable enough that we reordered for the third time to replace. The price meets the value and the service...."
"Good, basic comfortable work shoe if you're on your feet all day.  I just make sure I replace them (for my husband) as soon as the padding stops easing his feet."
"So comfortable and fit perfect almost a balance to the texture of them perfect tight love them will always have to order these year-round"
"I do like that it looks good with formal wear, even though it's a work shoe. Stretches to fit my wide feet. So farit has performed well as a slip resistant shoe. However, an issue has just occured. The stitching on the toe of the right shoe is starting to come undone. It must have happened when I walked through the rain. Can't believe it would come loose after it first rainfall. Have to reconsider buying this type of shoe since the sketches shoe I bought had the same problem."
"I picked the right size for these shoes and they fit perfectly. Usually I tend to wear a 9.5 wide but a 9 relaxed fit also works too. I wanted to make sure I didn't choose the wrong size or a wide fit in case they feel too loose when I'm walking. I tried them on the first day after picking up my Amazon packages and the quality is very durable, traction soles are sturdy and it's very easy to wear. Memory foam  is ok, not very soft but fortunately my soles don't get tired from working. These are a great replacement for my previous pair of work shoes for my job at Publix whenever I'm closing and have to clean or do inventory. I also recommend these pairs for casual days as well."
"Comfort: These shoes are incredibly comfortable. The insole is well-cushioned, providing excellent support for long hours of wear. My son didn’t experience any discomfort or blisters, even on the first day.Design: The design is sleek and stylish, perfect for both casual and formal occasions. The attention to detail is evident, with clean stitching and a polished finish.Durability: The materials used are of high quality. The leather feels sturdy yet supple, and the sole is robust, offering good traction. After three days of use, they still look as good as new.Fit: The sizing was accurate, and the shoes fit perfectly. They offer a snug fit without being too tight, which is often a concern with online purchases.Value for Money: Considering the quality, these shoes are a great value for the price.  .Overall, I highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a combination of comfort, style, and durability. They have exceeded my expectations in every way."
"I should have got a size bigger but they are fairly comfortable"
"I bought these white leather sneakers as casual wear.  I don't like to pay a lot for shoes and these were perfect for me since they look good and are comfortable."
"My son loves these.  He’s been asking for white sneaker-shoes, and rather than get canvas one that will get worn out easily, I bought these. They feel substantial while still giving him that sporty look.  And at a good price!"
"Very good delivery time, good quality, perfect size; not a five because a little bit heavy"
"Pleasantly surprised on the quality of these shoes - well made, comfortable and look sturdy. Really like them and would recommend these to anyone."
"Comfy to wear to work and easy to keep clean.Feels like good quality"
"great shoe"
"Very good and comfortable, but start wear it out after 2 months of office use only."
"I wear these everyday with my work uniform. They fit well and are comfortable all day. If they get dirty I just wipe them off with a wet cloth and I’m good to go. I recommend them to my fellow coworkers."
"The Under Armour Girls Pre School Assert 10 A sneakers are fantastic! My daughter absolutely loves them. They’re lightweight yet durable, making them perfect for all her running, jumping, and playing. The fit is true to size, and the cushioned soles provide great comfort and support, even after long days of wear.What I really appreciate is the quality—these shoes have held up beautifully despite all the wear and tear from playgrounds and outdoor activities. Plus, the design is stylish and fun, so my daughter is excited to put them on every day."
"These are perfect! Great fit, style and quality. I didn’t have to go to the store though which makes back to school shopping so much easier with little ones! Price was great too! No more running store to store trying to find the right shoe in the right size. Thanks Amazon!"
"These fit true to size for Under Armor (which in my opinion runs a bit small.) I sized up a bit to make sure they fit my son well and they did. He said they are super fast shoes!The shoes are a bit wider than I was expecting as far as the sole goes. The white under the black mesh also isn’t as visible in real life like it is in the photo. I was a little disappointed in that.Overall, a good quality shoe for young feet. Would recommend and get again."
"I have purchased this brand many times. Every pair has held up, especially for a kid that loves putting rocks in his shoes since Pre-K. So I would have to clean them out & sometimes wash them out in the sink, instead of the washer. I'd wash them out spray them with a safe Lysol clothing spray & dry them with a fan. + I use these shoe eraser from DG to get the bottom souls back as new as possible on the white souls we've had in the past. Doing that made the last 1's last almost 2yrs(They're hand me downs now). I have to buy a size(or size &½) up, they do run smaller. It would be nice if they offered the wide in all the styles. The straps should be longer, over time they either come undone, & seem to get shorter after they get broken in good. I would definitely recommend them.Update! ..I had to return these for a bigger size & I was charged twice, 1st was the $43.89 the 2nd was the other one $33.74. so I don't know what they did charging for both pairs. They owe me a refund of $43.89 what the 1st ones cost. I haven't heard back from Amazon since I called about them, I've tracked the return package it shows it was received. So I guess I can say I ended up paying full price+ some."
"We love under armor for our kids and with the ages of 5 and under we need something that is easy to get on and off.  The appearance was nice and the fit was good once they were on but they were so tight trying to get them on originally.  Definitely good value but might have to wait till my little ones can slide their own shoes on"
"I bought them for my son's Christmas present. Omgoodness!!! They're amazing! The color, the style, and the quality.  I want to gift it to him now, but I'm not haha."
"My son is 8 and he is ROUGH on his shoes. They barely last through his activity let alone the growth spurts. I have purchased this style in several colors over the last few years and they have held up so well. He finds them comfortable for daily use at school and they're easy to wipe clean so they still look great after a few months. Highly reccomend for active little boys."
"My daughter loves these shoes. I think they are super cute and exactly as pictured above.  The colors are very pretty. They fit well and are comfortable. The quality is great. They have held up well too. I think the price point is good for these shoes. I would purchase again."
"I must say it’s avg shoes"
"At a certain point in life, a man reaches a deeper understanding.  A viewpoint that permanently alters his worldview, and makes him question all that came before.  This can happen slowly, as experience and knowledge grows, and ultimately crystalizes around a kernel of this new perspective.  Or it can happen suddenly, in an epiphany of recognition that forces a foundational frame of reference adjustment.  Yesterday I experienced the latter, and I wanted to share it in case any of you have yet to reach a similar point.  As enter the fall of life, I feel compelled to offer this new personal world order in the hope that you may benefit longer than I will likely enjoy.While this change thunder-struck me suddenly yesterday, some background will help put the revelation in proper context.  It all started with the bankruptcy of Sears.  Sears engaged in a foolhardy acquisition strategy during the 1980's of retail and non-retail businesses that would be completely undercut by the digital revolution of the 1990's.  The debt accumulated from these various acquisitions would drag on company financial statements for decades as revenues slowly eroded to online shopping alternatives.  Finally, in the face of an unmanageable October 2018 debt payment of $134 million, Sears declared Chapter 11.  Eddie Lampert made several attempts to secure funding for a reorganization strategy, but they would all ultimately fail.  None of this impacted me until the end of 2019 when the last Sears in Jacksonville closed.At that point I had a shoe problem.  For decades I had purchased brown four-hole lace-up suede loafers from Sears.  They were a store brand that sold for $30 or $40.  I had probably purchased a dozen or more pair of these.  I would often buy two or three pair at a time so I wouldn't need to return to the store so often as they wore out.  But now Sears and my default shoe choice were gone!  Panic ensued.  I started searching the internet for the manufacturer of this shoe which I had enjoyed for so many years.  The hope was that another distribution channel would emerge, or that a transition to online sales could be found.  No luck.  So at the dawn of COVID-19, I was facing an existential shoe crisis.It was about March 2020 when my last trusty Sears loafers were at end-of-life.  Most real world retail was shuttered, and supply chain disruption was in full force.  There were no shoes to buy.  Finally, a local Rack Room reopened and I scoured the shelves for a suitable replacement.  I eventually settled for a deck style shoe that was only mildly stylistically objectionable, but seemed acceptably comfortable as one of the very few models offered in wide width.  For nearly two and a half years this daily worn (weekday) pair of shoes sustained me.  Last week I was forced back to the retail experience for a hopefully improved selection of casual shoe options.Did I find an improved post-COVID selection?  Hell no, I did not!  It was WAY worse.  There were no wide offerings at all!  Three shoe store visits left me cursing the pathetic state of IRL retail, and the stupid business people who were essentially forcing me to shop online.  So home to Amazon I went, with the name of an untried shoe brand and model seen in a store.  It was a pleasing looking set of footwear that I was going to gamble might be suitable.  And the size variety available on Amazon was breathtaking.  All the sizes I was familiar with, that were completely missing from any store, were available with a click.  I don't know when stores decided that they couldn't offer size selection.  They certainly did in the 1970's!  How did they lose that ability?  Anyway, shoes selected and ordered online with delivery anticipated in a couple days.  Fine.Ladies and gentleman, this is it.  These Rockport Oxford Eureka Walking Shoes are THE most comfortable shoes I have ever owned...bar none.  I am gobsmacked by how comfortable these shoes are.  Eureka is right!  I think back to pre-Rockport me and shake my head in sorrow.  Poor fella.  Stuck in a rut of frugally driven brick-and-mortar retail based consumption resulting in the bare minimum of utility.  Not even guessing about the possibility that such a paradigm shift could be out there.  Who knows what might have been if that version of me had found these shoes earlier?  Years of an improved outlook on life is the most obvious missed opportunity.  Perhaps he would have turned to philanthropy?  Trying to engineer life improvements for those around him in an effort to induce similar outlook-altering reactions in society's less fortunate?  I literally skipped around the house yesterday sharing the good news with my family.  I haven't skipped since a 1973 visit to Cedar Point with my Aunt Fran.  Eureka my friends.  Eureka indeed.  If you're in need, I beg you to give these shoes a try.  If I can convince just one of you, then this lunchtime prose will have been worth it.Edit: Two year update on durability - These spectacular shoes have been part of my workday fit for two years now.  No major durability issues to report.  The highest wear was on the insole.  The soles still have quite a bit of life, and are still well attached to the uppers.  One black pair I bought has fully thrown their insoles, and the brown pair have significantly worn insoles.  I still feel that this wear pattern is above average compared to my past shoe purchases.  So much so, I just ordered another pair of both black and brown Rockport Oxford Eureka Walking Shoes.  Love 'em, and looking forward to the fresh kicks!"
"As an Airline Pilot, I walk many miles around airports. I find these shoes to be comfortable and stylish. They fit my large 13 wide feet well. They clean up easily and the leather tops look nice with my bi-weekly waxing. I believe the quality of the shoes match their price point."
"Bought these to replace my worn Rockport Mens Junction Point Lacetotoe in hopes the rubber sole on this shoe would last longer than the non-rubber sole of the Junction Points.  While it seems to be a very durable shoe and overall comfortable, the crease created in the toe box from the shoe bending rubs the top of my big toe enough to cause discomfort.The Junction Points did not have this issue but their sole wore out in less than a year.  Will have to find a different shoe as I wear these for daily walking for work."
"The extra width is great for my toes.Comfort is key when you are over 75 and these are very comfortable.I've always liked the quality of Rockport and these caught my eye at this price point, so I bought a pair and I am not disappointed.I have been on my feet all day preparing for Thanksgiving.  I didn't realize I had been wearing these shoes all day - but I have.  My feet don't ache and they could talk they would say ""This is a good deal."""
"I ordered a 10 X-Wide pair of these Rockport Men's Eureka walking shoes from Amazon a couple of months ago,  and they were without question the best pair of shoes that I had purchased since the 1980s.  Actually, these shoes are not only attractive and sharp looking, but extremely comfortable as well.  In fact, if I was smart, I should be thinking about purchasing another pair of these Rockport Men's Eureka walking shoes.You know, they sure have a good thing going with these shoes so I wouldn't change the design no how.  By the way, the X-Wide would be comparable to either the EE or EEE width.  So there you have it.  If you want a sharp looking and very comfortable pair of walking shoes, look no further than the Rockport Men's Eureka walking shoes."
"Comfortable and they hold up well"
"Look nice and comfortable, but some of the outer color is flaking off around the outside upper heel making the shoe look unprofessional. Not sure why as this area does not really wear against anything... Disappointing after only wearing them a couple of months."
"These are awesome shoes.  They last for a very long time.  They run a bit tight, and pretty stiff.  I use old-school techniques, that I learned in the Army, for new Rockports.  I put them on, and wear them for an hour.  I'm not going to lie, they chew on my feet pretty hard for that hour.  Then I wear them for a couple of hours, on some errands that require walking.  They start out biting pretty hard, but after a couple of hours, they feel like a good pair of gloves, and they're like walking on clouds.  The third time, I wear them to work.  I pack a spare pair of shoes, in case my feet get too sore, but they usually don't.  After that third day, they might be a little hard to put on, but once on, they're super comfortable.  I have a pair that are 5 years old, still look great for office work, and are one of two pairs of shoes that I go to when I know I'm going to be on my feet a lot.  It's a process to break them in, but good leather requires break in.  These shoes are worth it!"
"Very comfortable shoes, look very nice too. I've had them abous a month and malfunctions so far. Sole still looks very sturdy and they are very waterproof"
"I had been wanting some nice looking leather look black sneakers, these fit great, and are very comfortable. Would buy again!"
"They are comfortable. How they wear over time is yet to be seen. Good if you're on a budget."
"These were the first FILA shoes I've tried. They are priced lower than most other brands. They are very comfy, with memory foam insoles and all around cushy feel. They are aimed at indoor workers, especially food prep folks, and emphasize their non-slip soles. The sole pattern is finely divided and may tend to track in mud if used outdoors. They aren't designed for trail walking. They look and feel good, so I'm happy with them. They are a little looser on the toe end than I expected, and I have pretty wide size 11 feet. These were the third pair of shoes I tried under the Prime Try before you buy feature, which includes free return shipping if you don't want to keep them. FILA won me over from New Balance, which I've worn for 10 years or more."
"I’ve only been wearing these for two weeks, but these shoes are great. Very comfortable, light, good grip, and great support. The size is true, they fit perfectly. These are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I’ve ever had."
"I am very impressed with the quality of these new Fila’s that I just purchased. They are much better quality than my previous ones! I was recently having bad lower back pain that I thought was from something that I did while working, but it turns out since I put these new shoes on my lower back pain is just about gone!! Plus the anti-slip and being waterproof is a high plus!! I highly recommend these shoes and I am going to purchase an extra pair so I can rotate them."
"This review is about my own personal comfort while wearing the shoe. I got these in yesterday. The slip resistant outer sole is there and everything else is OK.  But I am hard to please - I have a wide right foot and an super wide, flat, left foot, so this is about trying to find the widest, most supportive. This is difficult, given that almost no shoes exist that are super wide, truly water slip resistant, black work shoes. Recently I've bought a couple of different shoes and five different insoles, in addition to my existing shoes.  This Fila shoe (I ordered wide) is ok for comfort for my right foot. But not quite wide enough for the left( The shoe is 4E) I ordered a size larger as usual. The toe area is kind of snug. I think I'll go ahead and wear the shoes on alternating days - I replaced the insoles with Dr. Scholls insoles. The other brand I bought lately were New Balance 626. The XX wide in that shoe is actually a 6E. The NB is wide enough for my left foot - and I would say the comfort in that shoe is okay, but not spectacular. In the past, I've ordered Reebok Work N Cushion 4.0 in 4E - that shoe has been the most comfortable. Even though it's only a 4E - there is plenty of room and comfort. Reebok is the only shoe that for me is true size. I can order a 10 1/2, which is my size, but all other brands I need to order an 11. Unfortunately, Reebok for whatever reason does not keep it in stock anymore - the last one's I got were in February 2022 - there is no more.  It seems that, given the reviews I've read, a lot of men are also searching for really wide shoes - but forgive them - they'd also like a comfortable shoe - that kind of shoe is hard to find.  Really boggles the mind that manufacturers are not meeting those requests.  I have also tried the NB fresh foam recently - in 4E - they were wide enough, and comfortable enough, but the problem was that they had too MUCH foam. Instead of calling them New Balance, it felt like I was Off Balance.  I don't need a shoe where I'm floating around, feeling like I'm about to lose my balance.I've tried several Dr. Scholls insoles, because all the shoes I buy need the insoles replaced right out of the box with a gel insole to make them tolerable for myself."
"Comfortable fit with memory foam. Made of Leather."
"Ah, the allure of budget work shoes. They promised comfort, durability, and memory foam so advanced, I’d practically be walking on clouds. Instead, I got the footwear equivalent of a medieval torture device.First, the craftsmanship: exquisite! If by “exquisite” you mean the soles were thin enough to let me count gravel stones by texture. And let’s not overlook the toe box — where apparently staples and stitching conspire to create the world’s worst foot massage.Memory foam? More like selective amnesia foam. It forgot to do its job five minutes into the shift. By hour 12, my feet looked like they’d auditioned for a horror movie. I think I discovered muscles in my feet I didn’t even know existed, screaming in ways I didn’t know they could.Final verdict: If you’re looking for shoes to protect your feet while walking over a bed of Legos, avoid these at all costs. But if you’re into living dangerously, or need a creative way to get out of work for a week, these are your golden ticket."
"This is my first pair of FILA shoes, and I was wondering about their quality. All my doubts were away when I began to use them. They are extremely comfy with very good quality. Totally recommendable."
"I purchased these after comparing them to several other identical brands that were more expensive.  These are very well made, very comfortable - right from the start - no issues with blisters are sore feet.  I will say if you are between sizes you may want to size up as they are very very true to size.  There is no extra room for anything in between."
"I absolutely love these ODOLY Women's Cork Footbed Slide Sandals! They remind me so much of the brand-name version, but at a fraction of the cost. I’m usually a size 7.5, and these fit perfectly in that size. The cork footbed is super comfortable, and the adjustable buckle makes it easy to get the perfect fit. I’ve been wearing them all summer, and they’ve held up great, whether I’m at the beach or just running errands.My husband even commented on how nice they look, and he’s pretty picky about these things! It’s rare to find something that’s both stylish and budget-friendly, but these sandals definitely hit the mark. I got them in brown, and they’ve become my go-to pair this summer.If you’re looking for comfy, stylish sandals without breaking the bank, I’d totally recommend giving these a try. I definitely want them in even more colors!"
"These fit like a glove, and I love the color! Normally, I’m not a fan of this style since it can look a bit rough for women’s shoes, but these are soft and feel more delicate. I have narrow feet, so keep that in mind, but the buckle can be adjusted for a wider fit. Note, though, that if I make them tighter, my foot doesn’t go all the way in, which shortens the shoe length. If you're unsure about sizing, consider the width of your foot and whether you’ll need to tighten or loosen them, as that will affect the length. I’m a size 6 in most shoes, and my heel comes right to the edge, which I like. The base conforms to your foot, and I was worried they’d slide off, but the slightly raised back offers good heel support. Perfect for running errands and wearing around the house. Great price too—definitely keeping them!"
"These for true to size, and. Were pretty comfortable. Wore everyday for most of summer. The one thing that I didn’t like was the inside of the strap where the buckle was snapped onto, the inside metal covering of that snap or whatever you would call it was fairly cheap and became bent and loose . I was able to bend it back flat  with some pliers . But overall great quality for the price"
"These sandals were AMAZING!!! So stylish, cute, and comfortable! I am writing this review because I wore the sandals with and without socks for a few days on the Vegas Strip. Tens of thousands of steps later and many miles walked I had no foot pain whatsoever! If you’ve ever been there, you know it is hard to spend a few days exploring without any blisters or foot pain! I’ll admit that I wasn’t sure if they would be able to handle all the walking, but for $20 and an almost identical look to a well-known name brand sandal, these deserve an A+++ rating! Highly recommend, and I hope they last a while!PS: sizing didn’t seem to be a huge issue, but this may be worth noting. I bought an 8-8.5 at first and then a 9 because I was curious what the difference would be. When I tried them each on, the fit was just about identical. It was so hard to tell the difference, and it was even hard to make a choice on which pair to keep after adjusting both buckles. The difference was so hard to tell, if there even was a difference. (Both pairs said 40 on the bottom.) I am normally an 8.5 in shoe sizes and ended up keeping the 8-8.5. They fit just fine and I had no issues with the shoes being too small."
"The footbed is so comfortable and supportive.  I can stand for long periods and walking is amazingly comfortable.  The fit is good.  I have not had a problem with blistering while wearing these shoes.  Great bargain for the price."
"These seems to be durable.  The size and fit are phenomenal. My daughter hasn't gotten. Any blisters yet and they are very easy to walk in. She loves her stylist knock off birks!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I was going to vacation and wanted some cute sandals that could be comfortable and could match with anything I wore. These were absolutely perfect and fit the description. Only reason I docked 2 star was because of the straps and the quality. I am a size 7 - which the shoes themselves fit perfectly but the straps were a bit loose. It wouldn’t stop flopping off my feet until I put the straps into the last hole and second to last hole. Then it was perfect. But then after just 2 days of wearing them, they were already stretched. So now I’m practically holding on with every step because I ran out of holes lol. After the second day I also realized the shoe does leave a bit of an orangey color residue on your feet. After the fourth day, some of the parts of the shoes were already wearing out when I did not wear them for much nor did excess activity with them. Such as the heels and inner sides somehow. Overall I got these for a deal and you do get what you pay for. They are really cute, comfortable, and wearable for a short time, but I do wish they would have at least lasted me longer than 4 days before starting to go downhill😭"
"I like the color cous it simple"
"These sandles are fab. Slight bounce for comfort, cool comfortable fashionable. Great value for money would certainly reccomend."
"Love my new sandals. So soft & comfortable to wear. You certainly don’t have to worry about wearing them in or getting blisters. Gree re at quality & price. Very happy."
"They are comfortable and light.  Great slip ons"
"I have purchased, worn and re soled many pairs of Birks over the years, these Cusionaire's are a find! They look great, feel great and I have purchased 2 more pairs in colors I would not buy Birks in because they cost so much. These are SO reasonably priced! I bought the first pair this summer and they are holding up great, true to size, sole not disintegrating etc...I hope they will have a long life but even if they last a good year, I will be happy."
"I absolutely love my CUSHIONAIRE Women's Luna Cork Footbed Sandals! These sandals have quickly become my go-to for both casual and dressed-up looks, and they are incredibly comfortable. The cork footbed offers amazing arch support, which makes a big difference when I‚Äôm on my feet all day. The footbed molds perfectly to the shape of my foot, giving a custom fit and unparalleled comfort.The +Comfort feature really lives up to its name‚Äîthe sandals are soft but still supportive, and I don‚Äôt feel any discomfort even after hours of wear. I was worried about whether they would hold up with frequent use, but the build quality is excellent, and they feel sturdy and durable.Style-wise, these sandals are super cute and versatile. They pair well with everything from jeans to dresses, and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on them! The adjustable straps also make it easy to get the perfect fit.Overall, these sandals are the perfect combination of comfort, style, and support. Whether you‚Äôre walking around all day or just looking for something stylish for everyday wear, the CUSHIONAIRE Luna Cork Footbed Sandals are a fantastic choice. Five stars all the way!"
"As someone who owns multiple pairs of Birks, these sandals are absolutely up to expectations of real Birks! The Birks I have are the Arizona soft footbed. I wanted this style of Birks but I couldn‚Äôt find the soft footbed version in them. I saw these are thought I may as well try them for the price. Let me tell you these are even more comfy than my soft footbed Arizona Birks! Omg they feel amazing. They are nice and padded! They are so adorable too! Great quality. Will they last as long as real Birks? Possibly not as long, but for the price, they are absolutely worth it. They may very well last as long as real Birks. I have only had them a few weeks. They could easily charge a lot more for the quality of these. The price is a steal. They don‚Äôt rub anywhere. As far as sizing goes I agree they run a little small. I went with what the reviews said and got a size 8. I am typically a size 7.5 (sometimes 7) in sandals. I sometimes wear an 8 in sandals if they run small like these. In nike sneakers I am a size 8. They LOOK almost identical to real Birks. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell these weren‚Äôt the real deal if I saw someone wearing them to be honest. You would have to look close to see the Birkenstock name is missing. I highly recommend these to anyone with back/leg/foot pain as well. They‚Äôre just all around cute, stylish, super comfy and durable shoes! If this review helps let me know by clicking the helpful button. Thanks! :)UPDATE: They are holding up fantastic! I wasn‚Äôt sure about the longevity of these, but they have proven to be quality shoes! I now ordered another color in these sandals and also another style from this brand! I highly recommend!"
"To me, these fit better and are more comfortable than Birkenstocks.  However, the toe strap broke after 5 months.  To be fair,  I wore them EVERY day, but still that's a short life span.  So, I broke down and bought a pair of Birks yesterday & wore them inside the house.  The toe area rubs, so they are going back - these are simply more comfortable for me.  I can buy 2 pair a year at this price.  Hopefully, this company will make an even better, durable product based on all the comments."
"I bought these summer of 2023 and it is now Nov of 2024.  I bought them because I needed something other than flip flops to wear since it's warm here most of the year. I like that they look like Birkenstocks without their price tag! You do need to break them in first before they are commfy but after that they are great.  I have worn these almost everyday since I got them and the have held up very well.  I will probably buy another pair next summer as I am sure I will need to replace them by then.  But for real buy these actually buy a few pairs of them! They are true to size and if you have flintstone feet like me they are perfect!"
"This is the second time I‚Äôve purchased these sandals and I highly recommend them.They are comfortable, super cute and very affordable. I ordered the cognac and love the color. I also have found that their sizing is true to size. If you like the style of Birkenstocks but don‚Äôt want to spend $100 + give these sandals a try, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be disappointed."
"I liked my first so well I bought a 2nd pair. I live in hawaii where it's humid so I appreciate the comfortable foot bed that does not make your feet sweat. They have great arch support. I've had plantar fasciitis for years and I do recommend these for people who have this issue. My 2nd pair was a little snug but wearing them bit they became as comfortable as my 1st pair. They have not gotten to loose, if ya know what I mean. Some how they stay a comfortable size by not stretching out like leather. I got one of the black colors and the whisky which is a great color. I would like to get another color as well. I do not remember a smell and ease of use is slide in walk away lol!!! I think they are great and very affordable"
"Even my daughter who has like 20 pairs of birks thought these felt good and were good for the price. She was impressed with how soft the footbed is. Its getting cold so haven't worn enough to say how they will hold up, but seem well made. I do like her soft footbed birks with oil rubbed leather better, but they are $100 more."
"I really like these sandals! Comfortable, great support and true to size. Super quality and value for the price!"
"Love the quality of these slides. They are truly to size and I can dress them up or down."
"This sandals quality is great, true to size and the great price, good material also this color goes with many outfits it's very cutesy"
"I rate this sandal 5/5 since it looks just like the photo. It's true to size and quite comfortable. I will surely purchase sgain."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Fits good , looks good Can’t wait until my bday to wear it"
"Super cute sandals I like the style but not the most comfy when wearing them for long hours."
"Comfortable light weight shoes and stylish"
"True to size , also looks good"
"Very cute but not comfortable to wear. Left marks on my feet. Maybe a half size up might work. But not for me."
"Shoes are beautiful, the support in them aren’t the best mostly for looks. But they are pretty."
"I kept them in the end, but they are very cheaply made- would not recommend"
"Love this design. Premium design. Love the colour."
"I wear flip-flops around the house all the time. I've had several pair of crocs, and they're really good. These are similar to the more expensive Oofos, in that they're very comfortable and cushiony for your feet. The problem I had with Oofos is that they had smooth soles, no traction on the inside, and when they got wet (I tried wearing them in the shower) my feet slipped and I nearly fell. I had to take them off. These have some traction on the inside, and I've worn them in the shower with no problems. The fit was true to size and they are comfortable and supportive. I would buy them again."
"They were a little tight at first but didnt take long to loosen up a bit and now they fits my fat feet great. They are comfortable, great material. Sturdy. Wont be breaking any time soon.."
"I had a pair of the original recovery sandals, also in a flipflop style. After two years of wearing them a few hours a few days per week in the summer months only-the sole was terribly worn and they caused dangerous slipping on tile or smooth floors. 75% cheaper and a sturdier sole than the “oother” recovery sandal. Very similar style and design. I bought the black color which is just a basic black rubber. They were immediately more comfortable and seem to be of better materials and more solid construction. Another nice feature is that the flip flops from years ago would leave a black stain on your feet from a black footbed. These do not. I eliminated one star because these are slightly narrow and a bit tight across the arch, but I imagine they will likely stretch as time goes by. Good deal!"
"Not the best looking but they'll do! That said, they are the closest in comfort to a pair of old Nike Kelso flip flops I had for 8 years. They no longer make those flip flops like they used to forcing me to look elsewhere. These are easy to slip on and off, have a nice thick squishy cushion feel, nice not overly raised arch support, and each of my toes sink in without any odd pressure. I wear slippers in the house at all times and stand often. I try to find slippers that copy fatigue mats. Thanks to AMZN for dealing with my purchasing and returning about 10 pairs. I kept both the Shevalue slide ons and these thong flip flops. Can't speak so much for durability as these are my indoor only slippers but they definitely can be cleaned easily."
"Since buying these, I've not worn any other shoes. Simply because they are comfortable. It feels like walking in air. The only draw back is that I now have sandals lines on my foot, but that's just cause they are fat lol. But it's a nice snug fit and the black color goes with anything at all I am wearing. If you suffer from plantar fasciitis, these may be great for you. The thickness gives great arch support. It was a quality buy for me."
"Super comfortable and soft, although it's a different material than Oofos, it's also a lot cheaper and about 75% as comfy.These definitely work well if you are recovering from or have foot pain, especially pain in the connective tissue on the sides of your feet. Feet and your foot doctor told you to get a super soft recovery slide.However, my son has sweaty feet so the black coloring of these comes off and gets on his feet which is embarrassing. It just looks like his feet are filthy underneath where the shoe touches him.I don't have sweaty feet so I don't have that problem. I imagine if you get them wet the same problem might happen. But you should never get such slippery material wet, especially when it's on your feet, I would be much more concerned about a slip hazard as flip-flops are a major contributor to fall related injuries and water is another.There is not much arch support, maybe if you were flat-footed this would have arch support for you. But the primary advantage of these is how soft your step is in cases where you need to recover from injury and you need your step to be soft.I would wear these to Disneyland and have. Stand all day. All day, these are the second best recovery slides you can wear."
"I was skeptical about these, but I’m so glad I bought them! I had to get used to the part that goes between your toes, as it was a little big. After a couple weeks wearing them on and off, I could wear them 24/7 without any pain and they felt so great! It was a huge relief when walking on concrete. My plantar fasciitis markedly improved and soon I didn’t want to wear anything else. I only wish I could wear them in the snow. Haha!"
"This are still my favorite. I bought a PR for summer. Loved them so much I bought a new pair to take on vacation to Antigua. Well as days went on. I thought my feet were swelling..  Nope  they shrunk. Last 2 days of vacation I could not wear as my heal was hanging off the back. I still recommend these but do not take where it's extremely warm. Like the Caribbean. I will purchase more next summer. Fit perfectly, great quality and was comfortable walking. Thinking of a different color other than blk."
"This are perfect sandals for those with problems with arch support, planters fasciitis and flat feet. They heel is very comfortable, easy to clean. I normally can not walk in flip flops however I could walk short distances without pain or the strap digging between my toes of leaving my with burn marks and friction marks.A little heavy for travelling however at home, beach, the pool, the gym in the garden, short walks to the market, grocery they are perfectI will never wear flat flip flops again. I used them from the day purchased in the spring of 2024 and they also kept their shape, colour and comfort"
"All I can say is that they are super comfortable and fit well.  My feet are fairly flat and not too wide.  Some people note they are big or wide.  They stay on my feet very well.  The arch supports are very nice, not too high, great cushion.  I wear them to the pool and shower in them daily, they dry well and don't absorb water. The pink is super cute!"
"This pair of footwear sizing fit me well but the concern I had is the new footwear base show many cracked lines? It is new footwear but many cracked lines. So had to return. The arch support is not visible n flatten easy because it is rubber material. Overall a good experience in getting correct sizing. Just that material draw concern. Thank you"
"I’ve been using the Shevalues Orthotic Flip Flops for a while now, and I am thoroughly impressed with the comfort and support they provide. The arch support is excellent, and they have made a noticeable difference in reducing foot fatigue during long walks. The material is durable, and they feel lightweight, making them perfect for everyday use. These flip flops are also stylish, easy to clean, and maintain their shape well. Overall, they’ve exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for comfortable yet supportive footwear!"
"It was a great purchase, it fits like a glove, excellent quality and very comfortable. Be careful when it rains, it can be a bit slippery."
"Very comfortable flip flops with womanizing soft look"
"There a little tight and stiff at first but after wearing them they fit good. There good for cheap sandals"
"I absolutely love these shoes and I have been looking for a brand that carried them in my size and I finally found them. I am forever grateful for that. They fit perfectly fine. They’re very durable overall 10 out of 10. I love the black the color and the is to get on there’s no problems with these shoes. Fantastic work."
"Great material and quality! The color is the perfect shade of brown. They are slip-resistant and very comfortable! They are my favorite go-to sandals to slip on!"
"Too flat perhaps.. just don't feel right when walking.  Cute design though but uncomfortable,  can't wear it for long while."
"It’s an exact fit. My feet length is 12”I think Amazon changed the sizing because I bought a 131/2 and it fits good and now I buy the same size in this it’s a bit too small"
"These are really cute and great quality for the price! They run a full size small, size up!"
"These are super cute and Dainty"
"These flip-flops are super cute and very comfortable"
"This sandle is more like a shoe !  The arch support and sole are perfect . Very comfortable for this flatfooted guy. I've been able to walk 6 miles a day in these . This size is true , not too small , not too large . As these are worn daily , I also wash them often to keep them clean and from smelling they are easy to wash in the bathroom sink or shower. The soles seem durable and comfortable. The soles are like a running shoe . Pricing is excellent for the value . !"
"I recently purchased a pair of men's sport flip flops, and they have quickly become my go-to footwear for the summer. These flip flops are incredibly comfortable, with a cushioned footbed that provides excellent support for all-day wear. The straps are soft and don't cause any chafing, even after long periods of use.The flip flops have a durable sole that offers great traction, making them perfect for a variety of activities, from beach trips to casual walks. I also appreciate the stylish design that pairs well with both casual and sporty outfits. They are easy to clean and have held up well against wear and tear, showing no signs of deterioration.Overall, these men's sport flip flops are a fantastic purchase. They combine comfort, durability, and style at a reasonable price. Highly recommended for anyone in need of a reliable pair of flip flops."
"Nice product fit and cushion as you walk. The only issue I had was the grip design inside the shoe was a little ruff when I first started wearing them. I’m past all that now and happy I purchased them."
"Well made and comfortable. Size is right on."
"These sandals are wonderful, provide good foot support, and are very comfortable to wear!"
"They are very comfortable and look very nice. However if your going to use these everyday I would look elsewhere."
"I was looking to replace my older pair of leather flip-flops but needed better arch support. I am always skeptical when arch support is advertised, especially for a flip-flop. However, this has been one of the best flops I have worn in a long time. The sizing was spot on. I would recommend getting."
"Very comfortable. Great value for the quality."
"These sandals are very stylish and seem to be very good quality however, the size 14 was still not roomy enough for my husband to slip his foot into easily.  The top of his foot would get stuck so we sent them back. If you have narrower feet that probably wouldn't happen."
"Well made, very nice !"
"Comfort and price are in perfect balance"
"Perfect 👍"
"I have been a Teva guy for 30+ years now.  I have tried the clones because Teva are overpriced and always come back to Teva.  I have tried alternatives such as Keenes and always come back to Teva.  Even with Teva, I get the buckle version ($$$) because I find that the Velcro wears out before the sandal wears out and the buckle eliminates this failure.  And when I come back, I always wince at the cost but realize I am getting more when I pay more.  They are more comfortable, they last longer, they are simply better even though the prices are higher.My last pair of buckle Teva just fell apart.  Not the Velcro, not the buckle, not the soles, the straps.  Maybe I got a bad pair and these simply wore out sooner?  Whatever; it has left a bad taste in my mouth for what Teva charges that they have reduced quality to where the straps fall apart when they charge so much.So I tried the clone again.  It didn't fit right, I returned it.  So here I am again, buying Teva...  They just fit better, they are more comfortable, and if they are cost-cutting and reducing quality (they don't wear like they used to), I will continue to try alternatives.  However, credit where credit is due, I sucked it up and paid for the Teva."
"I bought these sandals for my husband to use during summer activities, and they’ve been perfect! He says they're incredibly comfortable and provide great support for all-day wear. They’re also stylish and durable, handling everything from beach trips to hiking with ease. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a reliable pair of summer sandals!"
"These are very well made sandals, especially for the price. They fit well and are comfortable .I have had two pair previously and they last several years every time. These are the only sandals I would ever buy."
"I have owned Tevas for some years now and I will continue to buy them. The fit is comfortable and they work well on both land and water.Having said that, I will note that the slab of material that forms the tread is glued to the slab of material that forms the sole.  This is the point of eventual failure - the glue gives out. This is usually around the third season and is why I knock off a star."
"Teva Sandals - what needs to be said? Excellent value and durability. Highly recommended for wearing as shower shoes, walking on the beach, or wearing into the surf in rocky areas."
"My old pair finally had to be thrown away after 30 years.  30 years!!  The velcro failed long ago, but I still managed to wear them.  These are just as good, if not better."
"I still have an old version of this sandal that I bought decades ago and have worn for many things over the years. I like the old pair so well I keep doing minor repairs and still use them as my ""yard shoes"". I've tried a couple of other brands since that purchase but they don't compare to the Teva. I thought it was time to try Teva again in search of that comfort and adjustability I had known for so long. I was pleasantly surprised that the new sandals are much like my originals and just as comfortable, I'm very happy with them. If they hold-up as well as my last pair I'll likely never need to buy another pair of sandals."
"After years of wearing a pair of Chacos that I never liked (the toe strap ALWAYS tightens during use and I hate the feeling of my toe being restrained!), I decided to just try a pair of Tevas. They're kind of everything I've been looking for. They are comfortable, easy to throw on when I need to get out the door quickly, and they don't look *too* goofy. Hope to get many years of enjoyment out of these bad boys."
"I got these to replace my original same sandals of 25 years. The best period. My go-to hot weather wear, easy to slip on and off while being indestructible. Recycle those flip flops."
"They look and fit perfect"
"Own 5 pairs of Teva. Will buy again."
"These are my favorite Amazon purchase of all summer. They are the most comfortable sandal I‚Äôve ever worn and are so cute! I was worried about the quality, but it‚Äôs great! I wore them all summer long and they held up and still look good. The straps are adjustable because I had to make them snugger when I got them. I wore them once for 8 hours and my feet felt supported all day long."
"I love these sandals! I‚Äôm a women‚Äôs aize 8 and I bought these in the 8/8.5 size range and they fit perfectly! I was concerned with the comfortability of these but I was pleasantly surprised with how they felt! The little bit of platform makes them a bit girlie but also still super casual so they are very versatile sandals.They come in many different colors but I was happy with my black pair because I can wear them with anything.I‚Äôve only had them for a couple of weeks but they seem like a pretty durable pair of sandal for that price point!Even my 14 year old thinks they are cute!Definitely would purchase again and I recommend them if you want a simple but cute pair of sandals!"
"Bought them for easy on and off for gym days since I need to wear grip socks and they‚Äôre not comfy with regular sneakers. They are comfy and stylish."
"Love these cute and comfy slides for casual wear. But they are slippery when wet and will easily tear if your foots slides through. They are true to size, quiet, and a good value."
"I bought these for my go to summer shoes! Great quality, light weight. Run true to size. And great value for your money!"
"These are so cute and comfortable! I wear a size 9 and it fits perfect with the 9 I chose."
"!! Update 9/10/2024: wore them to the beach over the weekend and ended up with killer blisters on the top of both feet due to the rubbing so docked down two stars.. plus side is they‚Äôre still lightweight just not as comfortable as the first couple times I wore them8/31/2024: Finally decided to order these after months of looking at it and i don't regret it! They're actually so light and comfy that i forgot i was wearing these little platform sandals; almost twisted my ankle a couple times  because of that bahaha."
"I like to wear shoes around the house since I walk hard, my heal will hurt if I don't.  These have enough cushion that I can wear them everyday and no pain.  They are a little stiff in the beginning, but worked through it."
"Very comfortable.  I’ve have several pairs of Chaco’s & OluKais. They are very similar in some area  & different in others. 1 Similar in arch, while a bit more stiff with the sole. 2 The sole on the OluKais are more cushioned and seem to bend more easily.  The Chaco soles are more firm and less flexible. While both have well supported lugs. 3 They stay on.  Both have a strap the is far back enough in the foot where, like most flip flops, they do not require a lot of toe curl to hold on to the flip flop so you don’t walk out of them. 4 I try to remain disciplined enough to walk a few miles each morning. There is nothing like a summer morning walk in “flippies.” I can’t make it a mile in the Chico's before I start blistering. I don’t have an issue with OluKais. The straps are softer and the soles more flexible. In consideration of the pros and cons, to me, the winner, given the ones I have tried, and my personal favorite is OluKai! Every pair if tried is more comfortable than other shoes or remaining barefoot and more comfortable than anything else I can remember wearing.Size is true for me despite the reviews saying they run small.  I think it has something to do with your toe length. They look great.  Fit great. Day one, during the break-in. I walked over a mile in them without issues. These are pretty fancy flippies, so I’m not likely to do a long walk with them. I’ll wear my older OluKais for that, but these are a joy to wear.  Another 30+ miles this week in my Ohana OluKais this week.OluKai knows and gets my feet and earned my business!!!  Sorry Chacos. My feet have spoken!?"
"I've tried many others, from Rainbow to Hurley. I doubt I'll ever buy another brand again. They are so durable, the soles are comfortable and sturdy and have so many color, material, and styles. As soon as I put my foot in them, I was impressed with how nice they felt."
"So comfortable, sizing does run a little small. I usually wear a 12 but 13s are a perfect fit in this brand. This is my third pair and will purchase them again after these wear out."
"It's hard to describe the feeling of having your feet into them but it feels GOOOOOD!!!1. I usually wear a 10 in all my sandals and size up to 11 in these, they fit perfect!! Happy I made the right decision to size up2. It's true that the sole may be a little bit harder than all my reefs but still it outclass all of them in terms of comfort and feeling good factor. You have to wear them to really get this feeling of comfort and quality.3. I have 4 reefs high end models going and this Okulai Tuahine outclass them all and it is my favourite.4. I am a happy client that will be crossing the bridge to 100% Okulai in the future.. Will be buying the Ohana and Ulele that will be on my next list5. Quality is outstanding and seems that they will be very durable. Will update on it sometimes in the future.Conclusion: I was hesitant to buy the tuahine due to the price but I am so happy that I decided to try them. In my opinion, it is worth it and money well spent."
"Really durable, sturdy, beach ready shoes. Definitely be careful about blisters and stuff when you first break them in, but once they mold to your feet they are AMAZING!"
"Order 1 size up. Comfortable. Expensive. Would have liked explanation for the various different types of sandals they make"
"I have worn a lot of different brands of flip flops over the years. These are probably the best I have had. They are comfortable and look great. I like that the sole is tough enough to walk on gravel without feeling the gravel through the bottom."
"I have ""low volume"" (narrow-ish) feet. Most flip-flops are waaay too loose for me. Olukai has a good reputation, so I bought and tried several, not really expecting much difference since they're all the same company.The Ulele sandals, the newer synthetic (rubber) model, were cushy but uncomfortable. They tore up the sides of my feet.The Ohana (older rubber model) is a lot more comfortable than the Ulele, but a bit aggressive with the molding (arch). And even though they feel a bit loose, they aren't coming off; the shape works well.These, the Tuahine, have a leather footbed, and are both secure without being overly snug and are very comfortable. I actually find them more comfortable than bare foot."
"As good as was expected, fit very well and comfortable to walk in."
"Fast shipping, High quality, and sturdy materials. However, they delivered incorrect shoe size."
"Fits at least one size small."
"Cute, durable, lightweight, and comfortable! I’m a teacher so I am on my feet all day and these definitely hold up!"
"Cute and Comfortable. Great price!"
"These shoes are pretty comfortable. Due to lack of cushioning on the soles, it's not something I'd be able to wear while out all day, but it's great for shorter errands. I have semi wide feet and normally wear 8 1/2 to 9. I ordered size 9 and they fit perfectly. The straps are very soft and comfortable. I have sensitive feet (just returned two other pairs of shoes because the straps irritated my skin), but these straps feel great. Unfortunately, they are a little hard for me to walk in - I feel like my foot kept sliding around. I’m used to wearing slide style sandals and have never had this problem before, so I’m not sure why this is happening."
"Love, love, love these sandals! Not only are they adorable (and have great colors that go with everything!), but they’re SO comfortable and fit my foot perfectly (definitely true to size). So far they’ve held up well and I haven’t had any issues. I am on my feet all day and literally never want to take these off. They’re way more comfortable than many other pairs of sandals I’ve had/tried. I love them so much I bought another pair and am so glad I did!"
"These little shoes have padding in the sole and they are so cute on. The strap is not very stretchy, but gives a little bit. I would size up if you have wide feet. They are very lightweight and the quality I great for the price! A nice find on Amazon!"
"Very cute and comfortable sandals however they run small. I wear a size 8 in sandals and these did not fit. Should’ve ordered an 8 1/2."
"I been looking for a pair of sandals just like these and they fit perfectly and are very comfortable"
"I am a sucker for some flat quick cute Sandles.These are perfect for the summer. They can be dressed up and down. Haven’t worn in me yet and I’ve worn them all summer long. Simple, light and cute. As you wear them the get less stiff"
"This is a great sandal. For the price! They look great and are somewhat cushioned.  Not an all day walking sandal but super comfy for reg use!"
"My children laugh at these so not sure how fashionable they are but they are so comfy. I actually use them as indoor shoes instead of slippers.Not sure how strong they would be for  lot of use by someone heavy footed but they do the job I want them to do."
"I recently purchased the Naturalizer Women's Baylor Heeled Sandal in gold for my daughter’s high school homecoming, and I couldn’t be more pleased with my choice!**Style and Elegance:**These heels are absolutely stunning! The gold color adds a touch of elegance that perfectly complements her homecoming dress. The design is chic and stylish, making them the ideal accessory for such a special occasion.**Comfort:**What truly impressed me is how comfortable they are. My daughter was able to wear them throughout the evening without any discomfort, which is a huge win for a high school dance. The wide fit provided great support, allowing her to dance and enjoy the night without worrying about her feet.**Versatility:**I can also see these heels being perfect for other events, from family gatherings to summer outings. They’re versatile enough to be dressed up or down, which makes them a great addition to her wardrobe.Overall, the Naturalizer Baylor Heeled Sandal exceeded our expectations. My daughter felt beautiful and confident, and I’m thrilled with this purchase. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable option for special occasions!"
"LOVE the style and perfect height for comfort, true to size and nude color. Worth the price"
"They are plain but very very comfortable. I danced all night at my friend’s wedding and they held up really well. I have bunions and these were very comfortable."
"I had almost stopped wearing heels after having issues with my lower back. Tried Naturalizer shoes for the first time. This fits well and is very comfy. Not giving 5 stars since I noticed it can get slippery on smooth surfaces."
"I originally bought the wide size because all the shoes I tried on in 5 different stores were so tight. But I ended up swapping for the regular and was extremely happy. They are comfy, cute and a good price. I wore them for a wedding and kept them on all night. Will definitely be getting in more colors!"
"Naturalizer is my favorite go to heeled shoes. This was the first time I had to return a pair because one shoe was wider than the other. It was not only uncomfortable but also noticeable. Both shoes were my size and not a wide width. Just recommending you try on both shoes and make sure they both fit properly. Always recommend this brand, as they run true to size, and are comfortable enough to wear all day."
"To be honest, I was very happy with these shoes when I first put them on. They felt sturdy and the construction was well-made: the sole was pretty comfy, and the footbed contoured very nicely to my foot. I walked in them perfectly. However, it was my mistake to not have broken them in a little before wearing them for a wedding I attended. I didn't realize how much the straps would rub on my toes and give me blisters. Now, granted I danced a lot, and drank a lot, and was in these shoes for hours - probably 11 hours. So I really put my feet through it in these shoes. Needless to say, my toes became riddled with massive blisters that I had to go to the doctor days after the wedding for - because those blisters became infected. (Try keeping your feet clean when you can only wear flip-flops due to blisters and it's raining outside.)Anyway, this is a mixed review on the shoe because the injury is partially my fault, and partially the design of the shoe. Get them if you only plan to be in them for a short while and you don't have fat toes that spread out and want to join the party. But if you can't do strappy heels, do NOT buy. They're pretty but not for me."
"Never been much of a heel wearer. My feet always hurt after a short period of time. I wore these to a wedding and lasted 6 hours before I started to feel some discomfort. Even then it still wasn’t too bad. I am plus size and have wide feet. I am in shock how amazing these heels are and stylish too. I don’t know what it is about the shoe but they are amazing and I will definitely try other styles of this brand, because I have never found a more comfortable heel to wear."
"As usual with Naturalizer, they are so comfortable and they look very nice"
"Likes: Quality, fit, comfort, style, heel hight, and material.Dislikes: N/A"
"These are surprisingly comfy. I wore them at Bonnaroo right after I got them and didn’t have any issues with blisters or discomfort. They are rubber so I hope they hold up over time but ive had them about 6 months so far. They also make me a bit taller, which I like!"
"I can’t believe I’m saying this but I love these shoes! I have NEVER owned Crocs because, let’s be real, the original ones you see people wearing all the time are just plain horrendous. But I saw these on a travel blog and with an upcoming two-week trip to Europe, I thought I’d get a pair to try out.Over the course of these two weeks, I wore them on multiple tours averaging between 10,000 to 23,000 steps per day and my feet never hurt! Surprisingly amazing arch support, easy to pack, great fit, easily adjustable, easy to put on, easy to clean and super cute - no one would ever guess that they’re by Crocs. They’re cute enough to dress up with dresses and jumpsuits or dress down with shorts. Perfect for a super hot summer in Europe.I would totally recommend them to anyone and these have definitely changed my mind about Crocs….but I still won’t be buying any of the original ones tho!"
"Wore these on a cruise. Lots of walking. Very comfortable and went with pants and dresses."
"I've been wearing Crocs exclusively for many many years. All kinds of sandals. Thick heels and more flat ones. Experience is that the thicker heels like these, never even let me feel the bone spur in my heel! These shoes are perfect fit at my normal size and such a plus to have adjustable straps on the ankles (one ankle swells a bit). What I did notice is that the shoes look much narrower and pretty on my feet. I have not worn them a full day and will update after. LOVE THEM!"
"Overall - Seemed super comfortable and durable, but appear to run short length-wise. Loved the closure at the ankle!These shoes were so cute and were just as comfortable as I anticipated they would be. The ankle closure was also really easy to do up since it wasn't a traditional buckle type, which I loved! The ankle strap is adjustable and felt secure, but the over the foot straps were a little large for my narrow feet and not adjustable. I ordered my regular size, but I sadly had to return because they were a bit short for my foot. I would have replaced with a half size, but they are only in whole sizes, and since the across the foot straps are not adjustable I was concerned that a whole size up would be too loose on my narrower feet."
"Love how comfortable these were while also being cute! everyone was so shocked these were CROCS! Perfect for wedding vendors!"
"i hate shoe shopping as a size 11 woman with flat feet and issues with plantar fasciitis in the past. but sometimes i'm on my feet for 8 hour+ days for work. i have these shoes in multiple colors - and the croc flats as well - they are my daily go to shoes. they can be dressed up or down and are super comfortable. they're also pretty quiet and don't made any ""farting"" noises when you walk around (which is something i have had issues with having flat feet!)"
"I love these shoes!  They are like walking in clouds and have good arch support which I absolutely have to have. I have been paying over a $100 for another brand that seems to have lowered their quality and don’t hold up like they used to. I am so happy to have found a sandal that will be durable, affordable and give my problem feet the support I need for my busy life."
"I bought these because of an upcoming trip where I need to be able to walk easily for 4-5 km daily AND look dressy too on several occasions . These are perfect. They are CROCS so you know you can count on arch support and those little bumps that make your whole foot feel great. I bought the full black (sole and top) for a dressier look. These are super comfortable and I just don’t want to take them off! Waterproof to boot! Just a note to buy larger than you think you need. I went on the Crocs website and it warns that this model runs small. That is so true. I usually need 7-7.5 in shoes so I bought an 8 and they fit PERFECTLY. Highly recommended. ADDED LATER: I am a fit senior and I took these on a trip to Vancouver Island last week. On my last day there, I did 30,664 steps in them one day on varied terrain: beach, trail, street. And yet, no blisters, no sore spots, amazing. They got wet at one point (ocean) and full of sand, and they kept on going--they are 100% waterproof. Really quite an incredible shoe design."
"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm writing a review on socks but honestly, good ones are hard to find.These are so soft, comfortable, not too think and not too thin. They‚Äôre not weirdly see thru like some socks I‚Äôve purchased in the past from Amazon. They‚Äôre also the perfect height on the ankle."
"Thick, comfy and true to size"
"Hanes few inches about ankle socks. I have other white Hanes socks and they are thinner than these, I like both versions. These however are more loose fitting and WA winter ready. Very comfy! They do not slip down! Weight is med-thick. Quality is great. Better than the thinner version of the white above ankle ones which are tight."
"I was looking for low, cotton ankle socks.  These are perfect.  They cover my ankles and keep my feet warm and dry.  I would recommend them for any athletic use."
"These socks are perfect for the colder seasons because they‚Äôre a little thick and soft on the inside. I really liked the feel of these socks and the quality that I will be buying more!"
"The price of these socks is nice and affordable. Not only that, but the quality is great too. They might pill a little but it‚Äôs not horrible in my experience. I‚Äôve been wearing these socks for 7 months now and love them. They are not too thin to where they feel icky and like they might tear, but not so thick that they make your shoes fit differently. They are soft and comfortable, even just to wear around the house and lounge in, and the crew cut is perfect. I will keep buying these for the unforseeable future whenever I need socks!"
"These socks are great for your money! They‚Äôre cushioned which is nice but not a great fit for athletic use since they slip and slide a bit.But for around the house or to the grocery store, they‚Äôre the bomb!"
"I got these socks on sale and such a bang for my buck. They are so soft and fit great! Usually socks run tighter on me but these fit perfect and are roomy. I washed them before wearing and they are perfect"
"got these as a dupe for the TNA/aritizia socks. they look the same when worn with shoes (the cuff part around the ankle). these are super comfy socks!i now have the TNA pairs and the fit is definitely different, but looks wise is a good substitute"
"These are actually seamless and very comfortable"
"Not what I expected from this brand. I‚Äôm returning customer but these recent ones are just flimsy. Not my favorite. I think they would get worn out too easily."
"I keep purchasing these! My go-to white socks. They are thick and comfy, but still breathable.They hit at the right height so they're cutie cute. I even caught myself doing a little happy dance in them ‚Äì they're that comfy!!!"
"Comfortable and utilitarian, no frills about them. Good quality and reliable."
"These socks are comfortable, and fir well."
"Great socks, as expected. Good quality. Will purchase again when it’s time!"
"My kids love them !!! Good quality.  Will purchase more.  Fast shipping"
"Great, I use it all the time. Amazing!"
"All the hype is Nike socks. My son loves these for football practice. They are comfortable and have great quality. Black is the perfect color so you can’t see the dirt and grass stains for practice!"
"My 13 yr old son loves these socks"
"my daughter likes them."
"Very good quality and value for money , they wash really well too"
"Quality product at good price."
"A must buy very comfortable and I bought them in black too."
"Item was as advertised"
"These on-pointe, white socks by Hue are just about the softest socks I have ever put myself into. They are true to size and the price on Amazon is cheaper than at Marshall‚Äôs‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"It‚Äôs a comfortable, perfect for your samba addidas or wearing them over your leggings. They last a long time and I like that‚Äôs there‚Äôs no logo on the sides."
"Super squishy, crisp white colored, sturdy socks! So far, they have been sequential to my morning wardrobe dress attire. As a millennial, I am well acquainted with crew socks. Now, in the mid 2000‚Äôs I do remember these socks (anything that wasn‚Äôt no show) were very much ‚Äòlooked down upon‚Äô‚Äî thus I remember being bullied for still having mine. Which has now turned me into a no show sock QUEEN. I have a vast array of different types. Now that I have a 9 yr old daughter, she has let me know that I should show my socks! ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid! Let those puppies out!‚Äù I said I‚Äôd love to but I have nothing to show.Then, we looked through all crew socks. These were the ones that hit all of my daughter‚Äôs marks. AND LET ME TELL YOU, these have me loving them again. YES I SAID IT. Tell Becky from 2nd grade that I‚Äôm not afraid of her antics, and I am PROUD to wear them again. Live. Laugh. Wear crews. Live your dreams. Frick bullies. Forget Becky‚Äôs. Long live the crew."
"Perfect fit & super comfy but the colored ones seem to get more pilling. I have a pack of just white & this colored pack & none of the white have a pilling issue"
"Really cute sock with any white shoe. With durable thick material."
"Love these. Perfect fit. When you buy socks online, you‚Äôre pretty much gambling on if they‚Äôre going to be good quality (same with everything else).  These socks are great! Tight enough to wear I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôll get lost in my shoe, but not so tight to cause discomfort."
"I love these socks!  I‚Äôve bought so many socks that either don‚Äôt stay up or cut my circulation off!  These stay up but don‚Äôt cut into your leg.  Perfect length too!  Don‚Äôt be surprised when you first get them.  They look small but actually fit great!  Lightweight but perfect padding in the sole.  Very comfy for my walks and treadmill."
"This is my second time purchasing these socks, not because they wore out but because I lose socks. I have the black ones and they hold the color well. I‚Äôve had the first purchase for almost a year and they wear well, no holes like other brands at a similar price point. These have cotton and are breathable yet warm enough for winter, great for those of us who don‚Äôt like the feel of knee high socks."
"I‚Äôm impressed by the quality of this. Perfect size, comfortable. It‚Äôs my favourite."
"These are very comfy"
"Nothing to complain about, they‚Äôre exactly as described and good quality. They‚Äôre not too thick so your feet aren‚Äôt being squeezed into your shoes, but definitely not for super cold days where you need your feet kept warm. Just average everyday socks which is what I needed!"

"I mean socks are socks, these meet the bill of goods.The height is just above the ankle.Not terribly thick, but they work for daily wear. I'd expect to replace these  within the next 12 to 18 months. My last set lasted 6 months. So these are good quality.Maybe I'm too rough on socks, but man's got to work to love these days.Haven't slipped in these socks so far.Thin, not super warm.Strechiness is fine, they snug up nicely."
"I like these socks, they're comfortable and they fit well. Only problem is they get holes in them very easily but other than that they're solid."
"These socks are great. They fit perfect on my big feet, i wear 10 in women's 8.5 men's, they're soft & stretchy. Even as my legs swell through the day these are not cutting off my circulation & the ankle height is perfect for my work boots. They look sharp, mostly solid black, they also don't roll down & feel like their actually durable. We'll see as time goes on but i feel like i won't wear holes into these like i do with the thinner socks."
"Cheap, and comfortable."
"Comfortable for everyday wear"
"Last a while but will fall apart after an average amount of wear"
"Trusted brand and comfortable."
"Very comfortable, good price, fits well, decent quality"
"I bought this exact brand and type of sock 5 years ago and they're still going strong. I'm only replacing ones that escaped from the laundry. Unbelievably good quality and very comfortable and warm. I also love they are simply black with no pattern. The ankle length is perfect and quite hard to find in UK retail shops (which normally only stock short or crew length socks)."
"These socks are wonderful. They fit my foot perfectly, snug but never tight. This calf-length never falls down, or bunches up under my foot. The extra cushioning support is excellent, and they are comfortable in all my shoes -- dress, sneaker, or casual loafer. The multi-color mix here goes with a wide range of my dress or casual clothes -- suits or jeans -- the colors are vivid and rich. The material is very well-woven and offer a lot of support, but they are not excessively thick, nor do they encourage sweating. For the price is is an excellent choice, and I will buy the other offered color ranges."
"These socks fit snug, feel so comfortable, don't fall down, look great and  keep  my feet warm without  sweating."
"very attractive, extremely comfortable, and appear to be very long lasting socks. my pair ran small but they were too nice to return so i gifted them to my wife. :-)"
"The socks were made of quality material. They are very comfortable and dyer several washings, tend to hold their original shape. I like the style and patterns of the material. Very good value for the money."
"I am so impressed with the quality, feel and fit. I find them to work extremely well with my work boots. These feel so comfortable. These allow my feet to breathe, not get sweaty with workouts and these don't shift around when I wear around the house. I went back and ordered another set. These will hold up nicely."
"nice fit and comfortable"
"Liked durabilityTop of sock squeezes my calf"
"The quality isn’t what I expected. They are very soft and cushion is good, but the top of one of the pairs started coming apart and they have only been worn once and haven’t even been washed yet."
"I recently tried the Alvada Men's Merino Wool Crew Socks during my hunting trips, and they have quickly become my go-to socks!What I Loved:Incredible Warmth: These socks do an amazing job of keeping my feet warm in chilly weather. The merino wool provides excellent insulation without feeling bulky.Comfortable Fit: The crew length fits perfectly, providing ample coverage without slipping down. They feel soft against my skin and offer great cushioning.Moisture-Wicking: I appreciate how well these socks wick away moisture. Even after a long day outdoors, my feet stay dry and comfortable, which is crucial when hunting.Durable Construction: The quality of the material is evident. After several washes and wears, they have held up beautifully without losing their shape or softness.Versatile Use: While I primarily use them for hunting, they are also great for hiking and everyday wear during colder months.Overall Impressions:The Alvada Men's Merino Wool Crew Socks are a fantastic investment for anyone spending time outdoors in the cold. They keep my feet warm and dry, providing the comfort I need for long days in the field. I highly recommend these socks to fellow hunters and outdoor enthusiasts!"
"These socks are so good. They’re super comfortable. They hold up well in the wash they don’t slide around in your shoe, which is a big issue for me and I end up with scrunched toes and it’s super uncomfortable. They are very warm socks for cold weather. The size is great they’re stretchy so if the fit is a little snug at first, they do loosen up after a short period of time. They are fantastic for cold weather and lounging around the house out house slippers on they’re not too heavy so they travel well. Honestly I love these socks. 10/10 would recommend."
"I’m really impressed with these grey wool crew socks! They’re soft, warm, and comfortable, making them perfect for cold weather. The wool fabric is breathable yet insulating, and the fit is snug without being too tight. They’re easy to get on and off. But I do love how they stay in place all day, and they’re durable enough to handle outdoor activities. These socks have quickly become my go-to for both everyday wear and outdoor adventures in the winter, not bulky i can wear them with my converse.Highly recommend for anyone looking for cozy, high-quality socks!"
"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to brand name wool socks. They lasted decently well for the price point and kept my feet toasty. At the time of use, I worked 10-12 hour days outdoors on my feet ALL day, hiking through rugged terrain. They held up for months of daily use and I was really impressed with the quality. On rainy days or when working in creek beds, my boots and feet would be soaked but stayed decently warm. After about 4-5 months of regular use all of my pairs had holes in the heels. Nonetheless, the quality and warmth they provide is great for the price point - especially if you're not quite ready to pull the trigger on brand name wool socks."
"Today it is 2• below zero wind chill.  Actual temperature is 8. A great test for these great socks. My feet are toasty warm. The socks fit well and are not scratchy and not too thick for my footwear.  So pleased with my purchase."
"I love to run and was looking for socks to keep my feet warm when it was cold.  I tried a couple of ""running warm socks,"" that did not really do the trick.  These absolutely do and for a great price!  They are super soft and comfy too.  They are a little tight in my running shoes, but exactly what I was looking for!"
"Socks were of high quality and warm.  Thick socks."
"My feet are always cold, especially at night, and these socks keep my feet incredibly warm.  They fit and feel great.  I wear them at night when I sleep.  They are thick and won't work with my regular shoes, but that doesn't matter to me as long as my feet are warm at night.  These socks are awesome!  Thank you for an excellent product, and it's priced right too.  Thank you also for men's socks in the larger sizes.  I got my husband some socks too and he wears a size 16 shoe and these socks come in this size.  To be able to get these socks in his size (14-16) at this prize is amazing.  Thank you so much."
"I ordered 3 brands of wool blend socks and these. Out of the four, these were by far superior-warmer, more breathable and better cushioning. I get cold feet easily, and these really help. These are great socks at the price, and if I hadn’t work]n the others I would have returned them. Highly recommended!"
"I love these! They are comfy, affordable,thick, non slip, good fitting, cotton, durable, not easily torn, low cut styled socks!!!"
"These socks are really comfortable and the material is breathable so my feet don't get sweaty.  I have a 9 1/2 foot, so I bought the larger size.  These are the perfect fit and they are stitched so that there isn't a lot of bulk or excess material at the toes."
"I just got these socks and I had to come write a review right away after I tried them. They feel so good!! Different. Not sure what it is but I love them. They fit perfect, they feel soft, at same time they are thick at the bottom but breathable. They are excellent."
"Affordable and great durability"
"These socks  were purchased to replace socks with a  similar polyester/cotton blend.  They were more comfortable after being washed and dried but not as comfortable as other socks I have purchased."
"Breathable, thick but comfortable. Amazing quality and style. Fit to size"
"Made very well. Washes up great. Comfortable and functional"
"Great fit and comfort. So far teo washings and very happy - no holes or issues wiil update if issue"
"I have been wearing these since I received them. They are really comfortable."
"Gotta love a reliable product.  Keep coming back to Hanes for these.  Perfect fit, and most importantly, they don't slip down into my shoes throughout the day.  I recommend."
"Love the socks. Fit nicely and not to thin but also not too thick either so all good things"
"Comfortable, not too thick or thin and the right height- exactly what I was looking for. I’m a bit on the tall side and lots of women’s pants are made so short. I hate having my ankles out because I feel like it looks silly and it’s cold too so these help with the look and keep me warm. I’m glad I got them because they were a lot lower-priced than socks at most stores. They’ve held up well so far too."
"These socks are well made and very soft. I wear a size 7 shoe and find it hard to find socks that fit. Usually only 9-11 are offered and are too big. These are offered in size 6-8 and 9-11. Fit is  perfect!. Love the colors and patterns offered. Will but more at this price."
"I am pleased with these thin, but not too thin dress crews. They are comfortable at the toe and the material feels good. They stretch enough and feel good on your feet. The socks do not slide around either. They are a good value for the money. I hope I helped you decide on your next pair of inexpensive but quality dress crews. Happy shopping."
"I was looking for thin socks and these are thicker than I wanted - but I still like them.  They are soft and launder well (cool wash and low heat dryer).  I like the variety of the package I got - some had cute patterns.  My only complaint is that these are tight on my ankles (and I don't have thick ankles)."
"Super socks for tennis shoes or boots. Excellent deal, and in my fave color, black!"
"I just wanted one pair of navy pokadot socks but had to buy a variety pack.  They are comfortable, fit well and washed nicely.  I would recommend."
"Ordered these as a cheaper alternative to my usual and am a big disappointed. They are soft, but after wearing one time there are holes at the toe seam. They are not durable at all. There is no ribbing at the ankles so they slide down a bit. They're not horrible for the price, but I wouldn't be buying again."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I have ordered these twice now. I wear these socks for work and I walk 20,000+ steps a day. Having a sock that is breathable, thin, and feels comfortable on my feet is super important. These are exactly that. It has taken multiple wears and washes to get my first hole. When I do finally get a hole, it’s always in the toe area, never the sole. They also give the appearance of a dress sock so you can wear these with ballet shoes and slacks.10/10 recommend if you are looking for a light but durable sock."
"Great socks..wash nicely, no stretching or shrinking...comfortable,  and nice fit...would purchase again.."
"Liked them for my 5 year old so much, I bought them twice. Sturdy and sized correctly. Size medium."
"They are great for those tough boys! They look good and are soft and a heavier sock. Purchased for my 7 yr old grandson."
"great fit, good quality, price was right, arrived on time."
"Sizing was very confusing to me-maybe Iâ€™m just dumb.Ordered for my 5 YO nephew his feet do not fit the size 1.5 sketchers shoes I bought him but these fit perfect his feet r to big for size 13 hope this helps everyone"
"The socks are soft, stretchy, durable, don't fade in the wash. The only thing I don't like about them is that they have lots of piles and everything sticks to them even after washing through heavy washing machine.The adult version of these socks don't do that, we have the men's and women's versions of these exact socks and the adult ones do not have piling on the bottom and stuff sticking to them, only the children's.But we love everything else about these socks and will buy them again."
"Donâ€™t usually get overly excited on SOCKS, but what a great price for the exact product that I was looking for !Wear a womenâ€™s 7 1/2 shoe and these boys LARGE, fit perfectly."
"My son loves these socks. The are very comfortable. Great fit and great value for the money."
"Great socks! Last a long time! Buying more!"
"Very soft"
"Love these new socks that I purchased! First of all my shoe size is between 6.5 -7…. I ordered a small in these and they are perfect. They are well cushioned but not too thick and love the design on them. Got the gray ones with a hint of color on them. I will be getting more when I need them. I wear them around the house on my wood floors and feel I go through a lot of ankle socks."
"These are almost the only socks I have. I love the overall fit and length. They are high enough that shoes do not rub on the back of my ankle. They feel very comfortable and supportive with just enough stretch. I will definitely be ordering these again in the future."
"Bought these for a trip during the summer time. They have lasted quite a while, have yet to get any wears or loose threads on them. They were thick enough and had the extra backing to not rub against my shoe. Cute and fun colors, had compliments on the bright red/orange ones. They are still soft to this day and have not shrunk on me, has some stretch still left on it.  Regarding the size, I am typically between 7.5 - 8, wide-ish and no complaints on the medium fitting me."
"This is my second purchase of these and I love them. They’re comfortable socks they’re durable they do not fade. You can walk outside with them on and they don’t get holes in them. I use them for work socks, but for the most part, they’re cute stylish they go with just about every color and they’re padded on the bottom so your feet are comfortable in your shoes, especially if you stand on your feet for a long time throughout the day ! it’s a great purchase try them out and if you don’t think you like them then don’t give them five stars. I’m going to can’t beat that. It’s always good to have socks that you love. Otherwise they just stay there looking lonely in the sock drawer saying hey, how come you don’t wear me ha ha ha anyways, it’s a great product there well-made I haven’t ever gotten any holes!"
"The socks are comfortable and great buy for the price."
"At first I was worried they were too big when I first received them, but after washing they fit perfectly (I chose my size using the provided size chart). I like how they're the perfect amount of thickness, and how they have extra padding at the heel. They're also really soft and don't feel cheap or thin. I've been using them for a month or so, and were exactly what I needed for the variety of exercise I do. I'd recommend them if you're looking for a good workout sock set; they're not the most visually appealing but they absolutely get the job done."
"So comfy and good quality. I also really love the little tab on the back because I always feel like my socks are falling down but this tab makes it so easy to keep them at a comfortable spot. They’re also really warm and cozy  but not too snug. Would recommend!"
"I bought a pack of these 4 years ago & absolutely love them. I work out 3-5 days a week wearing these socks & just now does 1 sock have a tiny hole in it! Definitely going to order another pack because I want to start to work out more, & these are the only socks I wear. They stay in place, absorb moisture well, & are just very comfortable. Highly recommend!!"
"So comfortable. Great fit. They don't slip down into my shoe even when running 5-10 km. My feet are a size 9 ladies"
"I love saucony ankle socks, so when I need more, I always come back for these. They last a really long time and don't break down easily, and they don't slide off your heel in the shoe. They are also very comfortable and stretchy, and the elastic doesn't bite into your ankles like some other socks I have had! Very comfy socks, and I like the colour combos. Fit easily on the higher end of foot size."
"Fit as expected. Very comfortable and wash well."
"Very happy with my purchase. Socks are comfortable, not too tight and they don’t slip down which is a huge plus. And I really like the colours."
"These are thick and cushy. Seems well made and they're breathable so my feet stay dry. I'm super picky about socks but so far they fit great and stay up. They do ball up some on the outside after washing so keep that in mind. The left sock was washed and the right is unwashed for comparison. They're work socks for me so it's not that big of a deal. I just pick them off and go on."
"I recently purchased these 6-pack of quarter socks from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. These socks are exactly what I was looking for: comfortable, durable, and affordable.Comfort: The socks have a great fit, hugging my feet just right without being too tight or too loose. The fabric is soft and breathable, making them perfect for everyday wear. Even after a long day, my feet feel comfortable and dry.Durability: After several washes, these socks have held up remarkably well. No signs of wear and tear, and they haven't lost their shape. The quality is definitely impressive, especially considering the price.Value for Money: Getting a 6-pack for this price is a fantastic deal. It’s always nice to have extra pairs on hand, and this pack offers excellent value without compromising on quality.Versatility: These quarter socks are great for various activities. I've worn them for casual outings, workouts, and even while lounging at home. They provide good support and stay in place throughout the day.Design: The socks come in a classic, clean design that goes well with different types of shoes. Whether I’m wearing sneakers, loafers, or casual shoes, they look great.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with these quarter socks. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of high-quality socks at an affordable price."
"These ankle length socks are truly xxl size and they fit my size 13 feet very well. I would guess they’re good for up to size 14 or so. They are soft, stretchy and thick on the bottom. Overall I like the quality look and color, they stay in place and they should last."
"I bought these coming from wearing Hanes X-Temp socks for years. These are about the same quality in my opinion. The price point is good. These are a bit thicker than the Hanes X-Temp.What I like:They're comfortable enough.They're slightly thicker.I think they're a bit better at preventing blisters.What I don't like:They're pretty big. I think if you can size down if you're in the middle of the listed sizes.Overall, they're pretty good. If you're looking for bargain socks, they are totally fine. About on par for the Hanes X-Temp."
"I'm a FedEx delivery driver, and am on my feet between walking and running 3 to 5 miles a day. These socks breathe well and are comfortable. They are a little big so keep that in mind when ordering."
"Have not washed/dried yet, but they feel just right out of the package. Not loose on my foot, but not compressing my foot. I had tried some from another brand and Straight out of the package. They were already slightly compressing, my foot, and the reviews on that one said there was a lot of shrinkage after a wash/dry cycle. If there is significant shrinkage and compressing on my foot, I will try and update my review. So far incredibly pleased with the fit and thickness. (Which is about middle of the road, not too thin and not overly thick)"
"I have purchased every type of Dickies socks and they all hold up. The cut is the best part, they fit so well. The ""HI-VIS"" type are different from the rest. They are thinner like athletic socks and are best for summer."
"I wear a pair of these socks to work every day in the summer with my shorts and safety shoes.  They lasted three full summers before they started showing thin spots, but there are still no holes.  They've remained absorbent and comfortable.They've been worn a full day (about 10 hours), washed, and dried about 60-70 times for each sock (one wear per week over a 20-24 week summer season, times three summers) and they've held up this long, and for the price that's impressive.They're comfortable, have good cushioning, and I liked them so well that I ordered the same socks again today.  It's a great value because these socks have outlasted their price point."
"I have a hard time finding socks that fit my very tall son, I love that these come in very large sizes. They have the right amount of elastic to hold them nicely in place without being too tight and leaving deep marks in his legs, and they are easy for him to put on which is important since he has a disability and it can take a long time and be very frustrating if they are too tight. He seems to think they are comfortable. So far they are holding up well, hopefully they are durable but he’s only worn them a couple of times."
"They are  more light brown than beige ."
"Socks are very comfortable. The cotton has held up very well after multiple washes (Have washed about 12 times so far). They definitely keep your feet warm, but also breathe at the same time. I can appreciate the weight and thickness of them. They do feel quality. They fit my size 14 foot very well."
"I have a size 14 shoe so most standard socks are just missing the mark.I bought these for wearing in boots. They are pretty tough.Not as tough as wool socks but they are a good weight and medium thickness for the Southeastern US.The warmth is nice but not overly so. The socks pull up high and keep boot tops from rubbing your legs.Definitely would buy again and highly recommend."
"Hanes Men's Work Socks, 6-PackWhat can I say, socks are socks.I wear them till they become worn then replace them.I look for comfort, good fit, good wear.  Color is an option.I generally have concern over fit as my feet are kind of smalland I just dont fit anything off the shelf, so you can bet if Isay they fit well, I know what I am talking about.RECOMMENDEDI do not know the seller nor did I get any product for my random review.241010 0120"
"I got these for work while money was a little tight and to my surprise they are fantastic. I usually wear something built more durable and long lasting (without listing brands) and in comparison I would recommend these and even consider purchasing more."
"Got these for my partner. I love that it comes in the same color, it makes it easier for me and him. We haven't had it for long but it seems durable and is quite thick, which is great for him to keep warm. It fits great and there's no problems when washing.10/10 it's worth it, if you like thick socks!"
"Again purchased on a coupon deal for a Christmas present. Really liked the description of the easiness of the material that’s described. I believe my husband will enjoy the comfort and dryness material they are made of."
"Lot of features for socks, very elastic and comfortable.  Very breathable."
"If you have regular size legs these might be fine for you, but if you have ""Dad Calves"" or larger calves than a 16 year old then you probably want to buy something else."
"Very comfortable socks at a decent price."
"I had bought these socks about 3 years ago. What I received are muck smaller in circumference ie very tight around my ankles lower leg! Not acceptable to me! I would like a full refund today, and would like to throw away these ""work"" socks both in black and in white!"
"Very comfortable"
"Perfect socks! The stay on great, excellent fit! Very cushiony socks and not too thin! I canâ€™t stop buying these socks! Breathable, soft, not too short! I definitely recommend these socks! Look no further!"
"These Hanes womenâ€™s low-cut socks are a great choice for everyday wear. They are soft, moisture-wicking, and very comfortable. Hanes is a brand I can always count on for quality, and these socks are no exception. The 10-pack offers excellent value, making them my go-to option for daily use. Simple, classic, and dependable."
"I've been using the Hanes Women's Value, Low Cut Soft Moisture-Wicking Socks for a few weeks now, and I'm really impressed. These socks have quickly become my go-to choice for daily wear.What I Liked:Comfort: These socks are incredibly soft and comfortable. The moisture-wicking fabric keeps my feet dry and fresh all day long.Stretch: The socks have just the right amount of stretch. They fit snugly without being too tight, which is perfect for my active lifestyle.Sheerness: They're not too thick or too thin â€“ just the right balance for everyday use. They work well with all types of shoes, from sneakers to flats.What I Disliked:Honestly, I havenâ€™t found anything to dislike about these socks. They meet all my expectations and more.Overall:I highly recommend the Hanes Women's Value, Low Cut Soft Moisture-Wicking Socks. Theyâ€™re comfortable, durable, and a great value for the price. Perfect for anyone looking for reliable everyday socks."
"They fit well and are very comfortable."
"if you just want some new, cheaper socks, these are totally acceptable. i think itâ€™s a slick hack fo buy a ton of the same sock so you dont have to worry about matching them up.theyâ€™re comfortable, easy to wash and put away since they all look the same and are a true black, are pretty breathable and comfortable, and have a good stretch while still being form fitting (i wear a 7.5 in womenâ€™s). and theres no slip resistance so you will slip n slide on hardwood.as far as longevity, i cant imagine these holding up as long as my nike socks have. they pill (create little balls) quite a bit. the fuzz on the inside gets caught under my toes after a dayâ€™s wear (i finally put two and two together because every time i would get in the shower, iâ€™d see the black fuzz go down the drain from my feet). they also are not super thick, very mid level/average thickness so i worry theyâ€™ll wear pretty soon in the heels and toes areas.but i dont want to deter you from buying these at all because hanes is a great brand and theyre genuinely pretty good socks, hence the 4 out of 5 starts. i would order them again generally speaking, but i plan on just saving up for some quality dri fit nike socks since my last bunch lasted me 4-5 years before just starting to show wear in a couple pairs now.so overall? i would genuinely recommend these if youre on a budget and just want to get some more socks in your drawer. theyre totally fine and after a month or so of wearing, i do enjoy them for every day wear, gym wear (i take off my shoes for leg days for balance purposes and theyre good), and for walks. just keep in mind that they may or may not last more than 3 years before they start wearing out. and ultimately, i think by that time, you could reorder them or get something more quality and be fine. so you can purchase with a general sense of confidence :)"
"These are nice socks. I was looking for something with a low fit. They are very comfortable.Good purchase!"
"Can never go wrong with black socks, these are very comfortable and soft"
"This stretches enough to be comfortable on my wider feet, without feeling restrictive. Have held up nicely after washing multiple times."
"When I first took them out of the package I was so disappointed thinking they were way too small. BUT .. they stretch to fit perfectly!!!!! And soft as anything! I thought maybe they wouldn't be so great after washing but they are - they stretch just as well as right out of the package. Highly recommend. Great socks!"
"These fit my size 10.5 foot and stay up at the heel inside the shoe."
"Purchased for my husband. Heâ€™s satisfied."
"Slow delivery but good product. Want these style of socks with no logo, so does the job."
"Pretty good quality socks for the price, will be ordereding another batch.They're thin from the top and thicker at the bottom, feels light at the top and cushy at the bottom, they also fit nice and they don't slip off easily... absolutely love those socks!"
"Overall the product is amazing, best in price."
"Comfortable and good fit"
"This was purchased as a gift and I could not be more pleased. The colors are vibrant and go on smooth. I love that it has vibrant colors and naturals and so many to colors. I was skeptical at first but glad I purchased this and will purchase the other colors as well. It also came with brushes that are good for the price. You wont be disappointed with this purchase!"
"i never write reviews but i’ve now had this one palette for YEARS and it’s been tried and true through and through. the colors are excellent and pigmented, and the glitter shadows are glitter all the way down to the last drop. i haven’t had to purchase a high end, celebrity makeup palette since i really started getting into makeup because this one has been so reliable. i’m sure the quality of the pigments themselves aren’t near as good as any of the more expensive palettes, but for what you pay they are 100% worth. not to mention, the highlighter is INSANE! my favorite highlighter ever and no matter how much i search i can’t find one like the one in this palette. it has a soft creamy texture that makes it easy to apply and it retains its shine throughout the whole day. a lot of other highlighters are half the price of this whole palette and yet they’re basically white dust with very little sparkle to em. this SPARKLES! if you’re looking for a long-lasting, good value, easy to use palette, i highly recommend this one. 10/10"
"Quality is good! My daughter will use it for Halloween makeup and just to do her make up. Has different colors, which I like about it and brushes work great no issues at all."
"I really like this eye shadow pallet. The pigment is really good. Colors are beautiful, and lots to choose from.However, some colors tend fall easily off the lid/brush when applying and then smudge easily on your face. So, BE sure wear a good primer, and maybe apply eye shadow first vs makeup if you don't already.The brush set, SUCKS. I'm sorry, but it does. Get a well made brush set, I feel these are more like paint brushes. I tried these vs my good make up brushes and the results are way different.Otherwise, I really really like this eye shadow!One picture is the beginning on the night in costume with black wig, and the other picture is end of the night, hours later. Make up is just slightly messed up, due to it being HOT."
"Love the colors and the brushes"
"I hope my daughters love it"
"This makeup pallet has such quality and my little girl loves it!! Perfect for younger girls who want to play dress up!"
"I bought one of these as a beginner set for my niece and liked it so much I bought one for myself. The pigment quality is outstanding. They are bright and long lasting. They look like I just applied them at the end of the day. The hot pink color is my favorite eyeshadow EVER. I have a big drawer full of very expensive department store and designer shadows but these are my go-to now. They really are fabulous! The glitter shades are a bit messy but I've never used one that wasn't. If you want to travel with this kit I would suggest you put it in a bag of some sort bc once used the powders do form a residue that could possibly flake off and stain your clothes. Other than that this is a wonderful kit that is too much fun for the price. Plus it comes with brushes! You can never have enough brushes!"
"this ""fold"" of eye shadow colors (over 80) with the brushes...the daughter loves it. they are even good enough to mix for other makeup uses. I just gave it to my daughter today around 2pm and she's already (it's around 7pm) used it for around 1-1 1/2 hours... she can't say enough good things about the quality. for the price, just over $30, it beyond great (as far as she's concerned. will be, as will she, be looking to buy more products from this company, odds are this package again... she even was able to mix them to create new colors... this purchase is NOT regretted, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"Great value for money beautiful colours very pigmented absolutely love it applied easily lasted variety of colours i loved from bright colours to soft nudes"
"Bought this for a friend’s daughter in junior high just starting to experiment with makeup. The colour payoff is nice and the brushes are also decent quality for the price. I’m happy and so is she!"
"Bought for daughter who is playing about with makeup. Loads of colours to choose from, comes with brushes. All brand new and sealed. Going yo love gor christmas"
"Great quality make up easy to use goes on smoothly with only one layer I’m very happy with it"
"Brightest colors . Gave as a gift for granddaughter. Came in nice caseI would buy again"
"I was surprised at the super cute case and lots of different items! perfect gift for a teen!"
"Colors very bright and pretty"
"My granddaughter will love this. There's quite a a lot for her to choose from."
"Product came on time. Thank you."
"If you don’t want anything serious this’ll work great as a fun playtime gift!"
"Bought as a present for tween girl, a brilliant set at a very reasonable price."
"This product is great for my granddaughter it's got everything she needs and is presented really well in this beautiful case really good quality"
"Bought this as a gift. Was very impressed with the quality and quantity for the price. All the makeup is pigmented and long lasting. Love this!!"
"I bought this for my niece who is 10 year old and oh my god. She’s super happy with the products and the quality. They are high quality products"
"This is worth every penny and amazing price！"
"I got this for my daughter as a starter kit into the world of make up. It came with everything is shows all unopened and in great condition. The makeup was good quality and worked well on her. The bag it comes with is super cute and convenient to keep it all together. I'm giving 4 stars only because the little stencils were iffy, someone with experience might have an easier time with those."
"It’s amazing kid and it comes on time and they give you a cute box box design when they deliver it to you !!🩵🩵🩵"
"Granddaughter loved the makeup."
"I will state up front that I make my own skin moisturizer out of hyaluronic acid and sweet almond oil....................................................................................*****.....................................................................................I bought ""Set 2"" four weeks ago.  This set of makeup and makeup bag are just as pretty as they look online.  The quality of the various actual cosmetic items and colors is outstanding.  I'm amazed and extraordinarily pleased with the colors, textures, and long lasting stability.I'm 68 now.  I put my Set 2 makeup on.  A friend saw me and told me I am beautiful and look so much younger -- about 30 years younger.I don't know about the other sets, but Set 2 is composed of items from three cosmetic lines:  Lameila, AOLIKOKO, and Miss Rose.Set 2 is pure reliable enjoyment!!!So many years have passed and a great amount of money wasted on mascara alone.  All the mascaras that were guaranteed to not smudge or flake did so anyway, including during the first three hours of wear.Not so with Set 2 mascara.  I wore and slept in the mascara for nearly 24 hours before there was tiny, tiny flaking which easily cleaned up with a moistened cotton hanky, leaving the mascara looking fresh again.The shape of the mascara brush is perfect.  I'm able to coat all of my long blonde eyelashes.  I enjoy the way the brush separates my lashes as the mascara coats them.  My lashes looked natural instead of fake.  Love the eyeshadow, too.Oh, wow!!!  All of the pallet & tube lipsticks and lip glosses stay where you put them.  My personal favorites are all pallet lipsticks.  In the set of brushes, there is a lipstick brush.  That's what I use to apply the pallet lipstick onto my lips.Enjoy!!!"
"Great shades and nice and compact design."
"Quality was best and I gave it as a gift. The receiver loved it."
"She told me it was a great gift to get ,She needed more make up She said she will buy this when she runs outs"
"I really like that"
"Got for my granddaughter for Xmas!!! She loved it"
"My five year old daughter loved this makeup kit!  It was adorable and you get a lot for the price. Will purchase again!"
"My niece LOVED this! Definitely her FAVORITE gift! Goes everywhere she goes! It's so adorable and the accessories were definitely age appropriate!"
"Everything seems to be good quality from what I have examined The unicorn is adorable and everything comes nicely wrapped inside of the unicorn makeup bag. This would be a great gift for a young kid that likes makeup and unicorns."
"Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Enjoys the items inside the bag. The bag is cute but not that big."
"I panicked after I ordered thinking I made mistake getting it because of the clean up or staining but it came off super easy. Even off wallsðŸ¥²"
"This is perfect for a little girl that wants to play dress up. Much better quality than I expected for the price. A great value and gift"
"This arrived just as advertised. Great quality bag with lots of make up. Our three year old granddaughter is going to love it!"
"My four year old daughter loves the makeup and the purse is durable. The brushes are soft and itâ€™s overall cute."
"Perfect size for my toddler. She thought it was cute and the bag was so soft."
"I bought this for my granddaughter! She absolutely loves putting all the different makeup varieties on and is so happy when she looks all made up !! Wonderful gift for young girls! It’s safe for children’s skin, washes off easily! Scent less!! Great price ! The sparkley purse is absolutely beautiful and just the right size !! It’s a 5 star for me !!"
"Bought for a friends 6yo daughter and she loved it"
"The inclusion of a Unicorn-themed bag is a delightful touch, adding an element of fun and creativity to the overall experience.  I just wish the bag was a little bigger. The variety of makeup items provided, along with their washable and non-toxic attributes, makes this kit an attractive option for introducing young ones to the world of makeup in a safe and enjoyable manner.The washable feature is particularly praiseworthy, as it allows kids to experiment and play without the worry of permanent stains or irritations. The vibrant colors and unicorn theme are sure to capture the imagination of little ones, fostering creativity and imaginative play.The only negative was the brushes were very flimsy, but an easy switch out."
"This is great for my 6-year-old. The lipstick is all a lip gloss so it's not a  crazy color on them . It's cheap enough so when they destroy it the first time playing with it you don't get up set. fun little set"
"Got this for a b day gift for our niece and she LOVED it! Super cute and really works!"
"My only complaint is that the powder foundation should have come in different skin tones. My brown skin daughter likes to play in kids makeup sets as well. However this only came in a beige complexion. Too late to return as it was for her birthday and she still wants to keep it."
"Very cute. My 4 year old niece loved it."
"Bought it for my 3 years old niece and she love it. She loves the unicorn purse more than the make up. The make up is very kids friendly"
"Bought for my 5 year and she absolutely loves it!  Does everyone makeup when get come over now and loves to put on a little for special occasions to be fancy!  Would buy again"
"Bought this as a gift for a 5 year old girl and she loved it!"
"I love this item it works very well everything can perfectly not damaged I rate it a 10 out of 10 and I think it was a pretty good price"
"This makeup kit is well worth the money. Perfect for teenage girls."
"Nice beginner kit for girls wanting to experiment with makeup without spending a lot of money."
"This was a Christmas gift for my god daughter and I thought it would be perfect for her since she is just getting into make up. The set appears to be of good quality but the makeup bag came straight out of the package damaged. I’m very upset about that. I would have sent it back but considering it’s already a late Christmas gift, I didn’t want it to be any later. However, the contents inside the bag appears to be in tact."
"This kit contains a lot of useable makeup for a reasonable price. Most of the colors included will work with different skin tones. However, some shades and items would not compliment darker skin tones."
"Got this as a gift for a 15-year-old GrandGirl. She and her cousin went nuts over. It. Includes A lot of different small products."
"We absolutely love these!!! I bought 2 when they were on sale and we both love them!!!"
"Perfect gift for Christmas"
"I would be happy to gift this to a person just getting into makeup.  It has almost everything you need to do a full face.  The only odd thing about the set is there is an overuse of the word ""concealer"".  For example, the foundation was labeled correctly on the glass bottle but the box said concealer.  It also had that verbiage on the cream blush, bronzer and highlighters which are all in one set.  There are two eyeshadow palates which I was very happy to see as that is one of my favorite cosmetic products.  They are both neutral and good for anybody.  I liked the mascara as it stayed in place all day.  I was pleased it came off nicely and did not settle into my fine lines.  The lipgloss is more like a liquid lipstick.  The resulting color is drying and darker than the tube.  I feel that was the only product in the kit that I would change.  Overall this is a well put together kit."
"This is a great starter kit."
"This makeup set is perfect for beginners or anyone looking for a variety of options. It includes a wide range of shades for concealer and eyeshadow, so you can experiment and find what works best for you. The set also comes with essential brushes and sponges, all neatly packed in a cute box. As you explore and test the colors, you'll likely enjoy discovering new looks.However, if you're an adult seeking a quality makeup set that you’d want to use regularly, you might want to consider other options. I’d suggest checking the contents of this set and then heading to your local drug store. While this set provides a wide range of shades, you may find it challenging to find a perfect match for your skin tone, which could result in partially used products that you may never use again. For instance, the liquid foundation didn't suit my skin color, and two of the concealer shades were either too light or too dark. They have weird crayon-like scents that made me feel unpleasant. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for—this set might lack the high quality, waterproof features, and skin-moisturizing formulas found in other makeup products available."
"First off, this kit comes in its own decorated box which makes it great for gifting! This kit is perfect for someone just starting out and practicing. It is a complete kit and will have everything you need for the face. The palettes are gorgeous and have plenty of usable options. The makeup itself is average, applies nicely, no clumping or smudging and dries pretty quickly without cracking. I was able to wear it all day with no issues. The lip gloss was the only thing than wore off fairy quickly, but not a big deal. This kit would be great for someone just getting into makeup, easy applicators and plenty of makeup to practice with. In fact, I gave it to my daughter and her friend to try and they love it and got gorgeous results. None of us have had any negative reactions to it either. Definitely something you could gift to someone!"
"This makeup set would be great for a pre-teen that is just getting into make-up to explore different options.  I would say by the time they are a teen, they already know what they want to use.  The foundations were a little hit/miss.  I don't think my daughter used any of them.  It did come with a variety of brushes and foams that she did like.  Overall, I wasn't super impressed with this for my early teenage daughter, I think it would be more suited for a pre-teen."
"One of the products leaked over the other things."
"I got this set for my daughter and she loves it, it’s a great starter set for any teen. It includes 2 eyeshadow palettes, one with nude tones another with pink hues, a cream contour and concealer palette, foundation, 2 concealers, 3 liquid lipsticks, brushes, mascara, gel liner, brow products and 2 beauty blenders. My one qualm with this set is that the foundation is the lightest shade of ivory and therefore, doesn’t suit most skin tones. I wish there was an option to choose the foundation shade you need, because just getting a random one is a waste, unless you actually have that skin tone.I do have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the makeup, especially the two eyeshadow palettes, The shades were pigmented and didn’t leave much fallout. I also liked that they offered both matte and metallic/shimmer shades.Overall, this is a great starter set, especially if your teen or tween is wanting to experiment with colors and products."
"So yeah, I'm definitely not an expert on makeup and my wife wouldn't touch this stuff because she already has her own fancy stuff that she almost certainly overpaid for.  She doesn't trust putting a brand of makeup she doesn't recognize on her face where it could possibly go in her eyes or mouth and frankly, I don't blame her for being cautious.For the sake of testing it out, I went ahead and applied some of it to myself just to get a feel for it and it seemed really nice to me.  The colors are quite beautiful and they apply nicely with the included brushes.  There are a couple of tubes of concealer and a couple of foam ""egg"" applicators.  There's an eyebrow pencil, mascara, eye shadow, blush, you name it.  My 6 year old daughter was really begging to have it, but she's too young, so this will probably end up being donated or given away as a gift.All that being said, if you're young and just getting started with makeup, this would be a fantastic way to get started, as it includes almost anything you might want.  As your tastes mature and your wallet fattens, you can start getting more selective and adding more of the expensive brand name stuff to your collection."
"My granddaughter is just starting to wear make-up.  This was a great beginner set for her. Plenty of color options. Has everything she needed."
"I bought this product for my granddaughter, but the products inside was so good. I kept a large part of them myself."
"It comes with everything you need to create a new look. I rarely wear makeup but had to for  some business meetings. All my makeup was old so I got this. I have not used every item, but have used most.The lipsticks are highly pigmented. The contour stick doesn’t do much - it doesn’t seem to want to apply to the skin. If you rub back and forth you will get some color, but it’s not strong or dark. This could be good for a beginner wanting to learn how to use it, but for people who do a lot of contouring, they’ll find it subpar.The eyeshadow palettes have a good blend of colors and do have shimmer shadows included. They are not highly pigmented. You can build up the color some but not much. The eyebrow pencil works well for people who like a subtle look. For those that use a guide to draw on thicker eyebrows, this product is too subtle to do that, but works nicely for a natural look."
"Great for a teenager!"
"I really liked it but it was open, as I lived in another country I did not consider neccesary to do the whole process to have a new one and it could be not them fault, anyways, I like it."
"I was thinking black friday it's hit or miss but this is a gift you give if you want them to feel like a makeup pro it is amazing I was floored!"
"Product was good  and really help look great and good cosmetics"
"With this kit I learn how to do my makeup. Really easy and this kit is complete"
"Product is as expected.  Good price.  Put together nicely.  Great way for young girls to practice applying makeup.  Great mixture of product in a very cute case."
"This was much smaller than what I anticipated but it has a lot in it for such a little case. This will be a Christmas gift so I will come back and let you know how my niece liked it but I think it is adorable."
"Purchased this for my goddaughter and she loves it. Makeup comes off easily. Definitely has everything a little girl would want would buy again"
"It was smaller than expected and the handle came broken. Definitely not worth the money.After my review the company took the time to reach out to me over the issue with my purchase and not only did they apologize before anything else but then they have offered to give me a full refund on the product.EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I look forward to dealing with them again!!!"
"My granddaughter loves it."
"This case is ridiculous. Not even fit for my 6 year old. The latch won't hold so it doesn't stay shut, defeats the purpose of a carry case."
"Loved the item"
"Product is good."
"Bought this for my 11 year old who wants to try makeup. It‚Äôs a pretty nice set for the price."
"Perfect"
"This All in One Makeup Kit has a great variety of different brushes and makeup choices.The arrived nicely packaged in a box and everything listed was included. The makeup holds up well and was easy to remove.This would be a great gift idea for teens or someone starting to try makeup."
"This all in one set of makeup application comes in a small box but has all you need to do your makeup.  The colors are vibrant and the rollers work perfectly.  After applying some lipstick and eye liners I realized the set is worthed. Have fun."
"Has so many things!!"
"The shades seem to highlight the eyes. Great selection. All shades for all women. Great price. Highly recommend..All colors for every occasion"
"First of all, the color selection is absolutely incredible! You've got everything from vibrant pinks to stunning reds, and even some unique and trendy shades. It's like having a whole rainbow of lip colors at your fingertips!But it's not just about the colors, the formula is also top-notch. The lip gloss goes on smoothly and evenly, giving your lips a gorgeous, glossy finish. And the best part? It's not sticky at all! You won't have to worry about your hair getting stuck to your lips on a windy day. Plus, it's long-lasting, so you can enjoy beautiful, vibrant lips all day long without constant touch-ups.Whether you're going for a natural everyday look or want to make a bold statement, the Color Nymph lip gloss has got you covered. It's the perfect accessory to complete any makeup look and add a touch of glamour. Trust me, you'll absolutely love it! 💄💋"
"I ordered 2 of these one for my mom (gold) and one for myself (brown). The brown one I noticed has a garlic smell in the bottom tray. I can't really figure out why but I'm assuming something in it contains neem oil. (Hopefully ) Aside from that the colors are beautiful. The eyeshadows have a slightly weak pigment. The color is there, but it's not overwhelming. The eyeshadows are also a bit powdery. The blush and highlights are gorgeous and the brown pallet is great for fair to medium skintone. I tried the lip gloss, it's kind of sticky but not bad. Overall I do like the pallet and I think it makes a really great gift for anyone! Just make sure it doesn't smell like garlic before you gift it lol."
"As advertised, not horrible quality, great price. Perfect for beginners"
"I am experimenting with makeup after several years of being makeup free.  These are small, almost sample size.  I enjoyed trying out the differences in the 3 types of lip products.  Great for newcomers and anyone just trying out lip products.  It will give you a good idea of what colors look good on you.  Good value."
"My granddaughter loves this. A bit cheap. She just plays with it"
"Excellent quality lip gloss/tint, great selection of colors, great price!!  I gave away the reds and kept the rest - love this product. Doesn’t dry the lips and provides the perfect tint."
"Needs More darker concealers and bigger brushes"
"Good quality nice color loved the combination and value for money .👍"
"I would just like to say I was very disappointed in the product and the fact that everything was in Chinese or whatever language you had on it. Just absolutely no good"
"Nice over all"
"Mmmmm…. Not too sure because I couldn’t read any of it… everything was written in Chinese so I’m unsure what kind of ingredients were in anything other than the cream palette that had mica, titanium dioxide already don’t like that.Most things had a very fruity smell, the lipsticks smelled really good because they contain “essence” they smelled heavily of cherry. The mascara also had a fruity smell which was a little strange.The makeup brushes were awful and smelled like chemicals… the aloe Vera lip oil had a pink applicator and turned my lips pink though it was a clear gloss I found that strange as well."
"Perfect march for skin"
"**Pros:**- **Comprehensive Set**: Includes a large variety of makeup items, perfect for endless fun.- **Real and Washable**: Safe for kids, easily washable to prevent any mess.- **Princess Theme**: Adorable design that appeals to young girls.- **Perfect Gift**: Ideal for birthdays or special occasions for kids aged 3-12 years old.Overall, it's a fantastic makeup kit that offers both fun and safety for kids, making it a perfect gift option."
"I recently bought the Hollyhi 58 Pcs Kids Makeup Kit for my daughter, and it's been a hit! The variety of colors and accessories is fantastic, and the washable formula makes cleanup a breeze. She loves the mirror and feels like a real princess while playing. It‚Äôs perfect for imaginative play and makes an excellent birthday gift. The quality is impressive for a kids' set, and I appreciate the attention to safety. Highly recommend this kit for any young makeup enthusiast!"
"My daughters loved this! They are always asking to use my makeup and now they have their own. I love that it comes with everything from powder/blush to eye shadow and lip gloss, as well as the peel off nail polish. And comes with a bunch of makeup brushes so they aren‚Äôt stealing mine. It also has plenty of room for extra makeup. They have been carrying around their makeup totes since they opened them. Definitely recommend this product!"
"This item was a tad smaller than I expected. The quality isn‚Äôt terrible but could be better. It is definitely very cute for a child. Only complain I have is that 1 of the lipsticks came with no lid and the drawers are a little hard to open without feeling like you are gonna break it. Other than that, it‚Äôs decent for the price. It‚Äôs for my 7 year old so she is going to love it."
"I got this as a gift for my very talented make-up artist niece, and she loved it. It is all washable and safe ingredients for her skin. It comes with an awesome book of makeup ideas and tutorials and has provided me with me some very cute pictures of my niece for the last couple weeks. So glad I got this for her and she is putting it to good use."
"This was okay for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it and that‚Äôs what matters.It is cheap though. The quality of the brushes are poor and broke very quickly as well as the lipsticks. The shadows are difficult to get pigment from without using a ton of product.The description of what each pallet is, isn‚Äôt listed on the actual makeup case, but the plastic covers. So once you remove them, you don‚Äôt know what each pallet is. Again, not an issue for a 2 year old who doesn‚Äôt know how to read anyways, but I was definitely curious what was what while playing with her.  Overall it did the job.It‚Äôs easy to wipe off, the nail polish dries very quickly and comes off with ease in the bath."
"This is going to be a very cute Christmas gift for my 4 year old niece who loves mamaws makeup.  Now she will have her own vanity.  It is a little smaller than expected from the Amazon pictures but still perfect for little hands.  Had to pry the brush drawer open first time but now it is opening easily."
"loves having her own makeup kit"
"Bought for friends 3 year. Loved it"
"Not worth $70 AU. Very poor quality, Very small case. Little bigger than the size of my hand. I expected a decent size case, with good quality kids makeup in it for the price I paid. Very disappointed! Also the case broke straight away."
"These are actually amazing. I got these for my christmas tree but I had to open some of the items to see how the product was. I picked out the blush and the pigment was really good, I didn‚Äôt expect that. I also opened the lipstick, loved the shade and the pigment again. Great set of make-up items. Loved it!!"
"I bought my litte sister this makeup kit last year for Christmas. I honestly expected her to lose it all within a few months, but the case it comes with is sturdy and has held up and kept all her products safe. The price was great and the quality was good considering its cheap beginner makeup. I‚Äôd buy it again!"
"Christmas gift for granddaughter. Look like she'll love it!"
"10th birthday present. She seemed to love the selection of make-up and the carrying case was nice."
"My daughter loved this. If was worth the price for sure. Easy to take off and she feels like such a big girl having her own ""make"" up."
"Definitely was a great gift. Super fun!"
"She‚Äôs 6 loves  putting makeup on me. I‚Äôll have to get her another one ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I think she will love this for Christmas"
"The price was very good. There are a lot of makeup options and they wash off my daughter easy. The jewel stickers were so much fun and there were a lot. After decorating the makeup box, there were tons of jewel stickers left to decorate other toys or my kids faces, and they did! Happy about this purchase!"
"My 5-year-old granddaughter loved this bright and glittery makeup set. I don't mind a little mess in the bathroom because it all cleans up very well. It's easy to remove from her face too."
"Saw this in an old Christmas Amazon catalog my daughter keeps. My daughter has autism and prefers to have pictures to point at. Anyway, great quality for the price."
"This makeup is super cute and pretty decent quality. Had a hard time opening at first but then we havenâ€™t had any problems since. Came with lots of brushes and colors. The stickers were a nice bonus"
"You donâ€™t get as much as you used to thereâ€™s not much make up in the trays, and this stuff has stained her clothes"
"Child was very excited just what she wanted"
"My daughter messed over this in 2 business days but good product"
"Perfect birthday gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She loves it. Very reasonable price as well"
"My daughter is super happy with this present! I got it for her birthday and she asked to wear them often. Some of the eye colours aren't the best (can't see the color after applying) but some leaves nice pretty colours on eye lid."
"Fun to play withMore than I thought wasAll the kids enjoyed. Kids who normal donâ€™t play with make up were playing with the make upAdults were also getting in the fun."
"The plastic box is poor and can dismantle and the glitters will be the first to end. But overall this just fascinate the 4 yo girls who received."
"It is a really cute makeup kit and my Great Granddaughter will love it. I bought it for her birthday."
"This product looks fairly good, however, when the item arrived one of the colours is broken and another one has some odd goop covering it."
"After 20 years of trying different curling irons, I can confidently say this one is the best! What really sets it apart is the extra-long barrel—it's a game-changer. I’ve never had a curling iron with a barrel this long, and it makes such a difference. It’s perfect for my long hair, allowing me to curl larger sections at once, which saves so much time and gives me consistent  curls.Another huge plus is the high temperature it reaches. It heats up quickly and delivers the kind of hold I’ve always wanted, but it doesn’t leave my hair dry or damaged. I’ve used other irons that would leave my hair feeling brittle, but this one is much gentler while still delivering long-lasting curls.I’m so happy I invested in this curling and the price point is great!! It works so much better than any curling iron I’ve used in the past, and the extra-long barrel was exactly what I was missing. Definitely worth the purchase—highly recommend it to anyone looking for great curls without the damage!"
"I saw a stylist using this curling iron in my hair salon. I bought it and couldn't be happier. It works well. The range of temperature is a nice feature and the controls are easy to use and don't get in the way. It's sleek and sharp looking and it works well. My hair is only shoulder length and it works well on my hair. The design makes it easier to reach and curl the back."

"This curling iron is worth the hype. I bought it on sale for here so fast. Doesn’t take long to heat up. The curls are really pretty I got the 1.25 inch and it’s perfect it leave the curls kinda lose. It does have automatic shut off. The barrel is longer. It gives really pretty curls. Wish I had bought it sooner."
"Just got this thing yesterday and I’m already obsessed! Easiest curler I’ve ever used. I love the extra long barrel and it wraps my hair gently without over pulling it. I don’t think I’ll ever use another brand after this"
"Makes curling hair so fast and easy! Beautiful curl"
"If you’re looking for a curling iron that offers professional results without the ultra high price tag, this pro curling iron is a great option. While it’s a bit of an investment, it’s actually more affordable than many high end styling tools, and the results speak for themselves.I have long, thick hair and the 1.25 inch works great, leaves hair smooth and shiny. There’s no tugging or pulling, just a smooth glide that feels gentle on my hair. The design makes it easy to maneuver, and with a bit of practice and the help of a few tutorials, I’ve been able to perfect my waves.For best results, I found that taking time to get the technique down is key. Once you have that, the waves turn out beautifully, and they last all day with a light spritz of hairspray."
"Love it. Leaves hair soft..works amazing"
"I am brand new to using curling irons, and this was a great one to learn with. I like that it did not pull my hair at all and I love that it was long enough to wrap my section of hair. I find that other irons I’ve tried to use were too short. The lock-in for the temperature setting is a game changer because I unintentionally must have pressed the temp button and off button a million times!! Highly recommend!"
"This curling iron heats up fast with option to use high temperatures—which speeds up the styling process! It’s extra long barrel makes it much easier to create waves in shoulder length hair. It’s lightweight which is great for arthritic hands. Arrived very well packed."
"Great clipper with many comb sizes available.  There are larger sizes available then what is included in the kit.I use this to cut my own hair.  I was originally thinking I would just use it to make small adjustments to help extend the length between going to the hair stylist.  With the discovery of the 1.5"" wahl guide comb I am able to cut the hair on the top of my head, very easy to do with the cordless.  Cutting the sides requires a little thinking because I have 5/8"" on the sides and back.  After watching a couple on-line videos on how to cut hair with clippers I realized what needs to be done.Whenever I go to the hair stylist I always get let down with the cut.  The last time was the breaking point, it seemed like everything I was asked was just thrown out and my hair was cut their way.  Very frustrating to say the least.  I thought that in the worst case I could do no worse.  What I did was get one last hair cut after I purchased this clipper.  I watched very closely how it was done, not too close on the parts I didn't like.  Any way, I went home and put a guide comb on the clipper and with the clipper off, I pushed it through my hair.  I was able to find which guide comb was used on my head and how far up the sides.  I have 5/8"" on the sides and back and 1.5""; on the top.  Wahl makes the 1.5""; guide comb which really makes the deal.  I put the 1.5"" comb on the clipper and turned it on then ran it over my head, it just cut some stray hairs but I was able to see just how easy it was to use, I could hold it at all the angles needed to run over the top of my head.  Overrunning the sides and back were no issue since they are shorter.  Then I put on the clipper for the sides and ran it around. The area where the sides/back meet the top need to be blended gradually which is really easy using the technique on the Wahl website and shown in the instruction book, called blending.  The blending is using the rocking motion at the end of cut, the photo in the instructions and the video make it clear.  Same technique my hair stylist used too.So far I have done 3 hair cuts, I cut more often because there is no charge and I figured if I messed up the problem would be small.  The result was amazingly good and took almost no skill.  The hardest part is squaring off the back, kind of hard to look in a mirror and watch while moving the clipper.  I just did several dry runs, with the clipper off till I felt I had the technique correct then turned it on and cut.  Perfect results.  Now I cut my hair in the morning before taking a shower, no lost time sitting in a hair cut shop waiting to have a less than average hair cut.I received 12 guide comb attachments with the clipper.  I think there was more than the basic set.  Very happy with the quality of the combs.  The clipper feels good and it is not too heavy.  No cord really helps cutting your own hair.  The case is a soft zipper case, holds everything in it.  It is ok quality.  I have not yet ran a change out on the clipper, it lasts longer than I could possibly use it.  Perhaps for several hair cuts it would not make it but for one person no issue.  The rechargeable battery is the weak point, the instructions say it will only last 3-5 years.  Seems short but the instructions also say the clipper can be used with the cord plugged in.  So that would be the back for one day when it finally gives up.This really changed my mind on cutting my own hair.  It is no harder than trimming a beard, really easy for me to pick up.  If you ever thought about cutting your own hair give it a try, you may be surprised how easy it can be.  Just get it cut one more time at the hair stylist then go home and run the clipper with the comb attached, no power and see what was cut to which point.  That really helps teach you how to cut.UPDATE:  I have been using this clipper to cut my own hair for over 1 year.  I have improved cutting my hair a bit.  I cut my hair more often these days because it is no charge and I like to maintain the same general look. I'm amazed at how easy it is to cut my own hair, I should have tried this years ago.  It has become so easy to cut my own hair I hardly think about it any more.  I have become better at cutting my own hair so that it looks the way I like it.  And I can repeat it easily.  My wife likes the way it looks too."
"I was skeptical because it was so cheap, but honestly this is the best hair cutting kit I've ever purchased. I've cut my own hair since I was a teenager and this set is perfect. Quieter, lighter weight, smoother cut, and I especially love that the attachments are different colors to make it easier to find what you need"
"I like keeping my hair very short. Sometimes I even shave my head. I don’t have enough hair to go to a barber. Trimmers with cords can be quite  cumbersome. This trimmer caught my interest because it can be operated with or without the charging cord, it can be used with water and it is a common brand with which I am familiar.This trimmer takes very little time to charge. Once charged, it can be used several times before it needs to be recharged. Provided the trimmer hasn’t been run completely dead, it can be used while the charger is connected. Because the trimmer is cordless and can be used in water, I have used it in the shower for a quick trim. During the summer I occasionally will go outside to cut my hair so a do not have a mess inside.This trimmer comes with a handy kit. The kit includes a zip up carrying case, a comb, lubricant, a charging cable and a large assortment of guards in addition to the trimmer. The guards are pretty much useless to me because I have pathetic facial hair and I buzz the hair on my scalp without any guards. The trimmer may be a little large and cumbersome to regularly use it for facial hair. The bare trimmer gives a close cut, but I’d prefer if it got closer. My corded Wahl trimmer has a lever to toggle between two levels of closeness and I miss it on the cordless.This Wahl trimmer has a pretty wide head. I appreciate this for a couple reasons. With the wide head, it takes less time to trim my whole head. The second advantage of the wider head is I am less likely to miss a spot. I can overlap strokes to ensure coverage and still not take forever to complete the task.Because this trimmer is larger, heavier and a wider trimmer head, it does make it less practical for trimming facial hair especially around the mouth and nose. I mentioned before that this trimmer doesn’t get terribly close so that makes it less practical to use on the face because a longer stubble will be left in comparison to facial hair trimmers.In conclusion, I really like this trimmer, but I took a star off because the trimmer doesn’t get as close as I would prefer"
"Cheap and useful. Best head shaver out there and wireless."
"light and much easier than corded. no problem with the low-end battery, don't use it all that much. my facial hair is sparse and light, so it works great for shaving too (I use cooking oil and running cool water, I have no idea whether that's safe but it works)"
"It came with a ton of accessories that are useful and well labelled.  The colour coding helps get you what you need quickly.  The guide was helpful without being overbearing..  Lots of power compared to my last razor."
"I'm really pleased with my purchase. Considering the price, it was more than I was expecting. The only thing I can complain about is that it's not very sharp for lines cut around my son's hair, but it's still pretty good."
"I am 50+ years old with ethnically mixed hair.  I use this ChI 44, almost exclusively on my bang.  No matter how else I am wearing my hair, I am always stuck with the bang my brother ""helped"" me cut, when I was 5 years old.  And with my hair texture, frizz, just frizz.  It used to just either be puffy BIG BANG frizzy, or tight and drawn up frizz.  SO, now that I found this, if I go out of the house I use it.  It protects my hair from the heat & definitely helps it, to straighten in one flat iron pass .  I have also, since I began using this about 6-7 years ago, been able to turn way down both my flat iron, and curling wand temperature.  I spray some on my bang, comb through, hit it with some heat to detangle; then after it is straight i put a bit more CHI 44, in my hands(this is why the pump was helpful) & lightly apply to my bang.  I pull my wand or flat iron through again, this time I curl it under, like a Bob, and I then turn it under; and immediately unplug the device, hold it curled, for however long my arthritic shoulder will let me, then toss it into a large open roller.  Lastly, if possible, and as quickly as I can I blast it with cool air (usually the car A/C because I am usually doing this on the way to the doctors, or wherever I am going).  Then I leave the curler in till I get where I am going, but 10 minutes usually does the trick.  Even as i am typing this, i can't believe after all these years of hair struggles, I have what can be called a system or a routine.  I have medical limitations, so I don't do my hair to leave the house every day.  So, routing doesn't quite fit.  This works better than anything ever has.  When I am able to do steps using the CHI 44 guard, heat, and a curler, my bang drops from the curler & it is ""fresh blowout bouncy"".  I am also sure it helps fight humidity etc. So, I am giving it 5 stars.  With me health, and medications, I am always hot and humid and eventually my hair does frizz.  But with age, I have come to realize, that for me, I care far more about my appearance upon my entrance then my departure.  I do not think people pay as much attention to my flaws, as I worry about.  And if they do, it's probably within the first few minutes of seeing me.  So having a good bang entrance has really pleased me.  Now I like i can throw the rest of the birds nest I call hair into a ponytail and get to enjoying a day out of the house.  Lastly the smell, i am very sensitive to smells.  This smells like ""heat protection"" it has the smell a good thermal protection shampoo or conditioner has.  Not pleasant, but not sickening.  Also, it does not linger.  If it stayed I would not recommend it, but it fades quickly.  My husband however did comment a few times in the closed car.  I usually spray it before I leave the house, then heat straighten it, in the car etc.  So, it is when I go to spray the tiny bit on my hands, before curling it under, that it bothers him.  That is why I got a pump to try.  It seems to work as well as the aerosol version, with the added benefit, that one quick pump into my hand doesn't fill the car with the scent the way aerosolizing it does/.  I like having both pump and can.  Recently, I started using a few spritzes from the hairline back a few inches into my pulled back hair.  I hadn't tried this, in all the years since i found it, because i have neck problems, I am hesitant to use any kind of holding products for fear of having difficulty washing them out.  This has not been a problem, leaves no flaking residue behind.  And it does keep my ponytail neat.  The can is quicker for this, but the pump works the same.  I have used the iron guard with assistance, to help when straightening my whole head after shampoo. It was great.  But, I have not tried this with the pump.  I will update if I do.  This product has helped me so much, I will keep eye out for any questions about it, that i can answer.  Good luck if you are trying it for the first time."
"Smells GREAT! Helps reduce heat damage for hair straightener, curling iron and blow drying. High quality spray essy to use bottle, makes hair soft and shiny. If you have damaged hair or put heater to your hair, you NEED this spray."
"A nice heat protectant- I don‚Äôt like how it sprays onto my hair so I sprayed it into my hand and then palm it through my hair and combs through. It‚Äôs not sticky. It‚Äôs not heavy. It‚Äôs not tacky. I don‚Äôt mind the scent. I use it when I straighten or curl my hair and my hair always has a nice smooth texture and looks shiny"
"Since I‚Äôve been using this, I‚Äôve noticed less damage in my hair! I use heat frequently and needed something heavy duty to protect my hair. A lot of heat protectants I‚Äôve used have made my hair greasy, but I don‚Äôt have that problem with this one!I‚Äôm not super fond of the texture of this spray- it‚Äôs akin to hairspray. It makes your hair sort of stiff and weighty, but after a quick brush-through, it‚Äôs mostly fine. It‚Äôs just sort of strange.The scent is fine. It‚Äôs not bad, it just smells like any other hair product, a bit chemically.Apart from a few little gripes, it‚Äôs definitely helped my hair and has become a regular product in my hair routine!"
"I love chi iron guard. It works so good with my flat iron. It leaves some shine behind as well. And the smell, omg, it‚Äôs amazing. I love this stuff!!"
"I really love this heat protectant because of how well it protects my hair, but it leaves behind a very sticky residue to my hair that makes it super tough. Keeps the hold of my styling and makes it mostly straight but I can't run my hands through my hair whatsoever."
"Perfect for medium thick, dry, curly hair. Spray it on dry hair. It smooths it great with a hot straightening brush and takes away frizz and lasts a few days. Depending on your hair, you might need a spray shiner. I also use a leave in conditioner after shower on wet hair. Then dry my hair. Then spray this on, right before using hot tool."
"I have 3B curls-very fine, porous hair. This is the best heat spray I've used. It's not oily, and leaves hair voluminous, but not frizzy. It also has a pleasant ""salon"" smell. I've tried other heat sprays but always come back to this one."
"I wasn't sure if I wanted to purchase this as I am very picky with smells if I don't know what I'm buying but am I ever glad I got this one my frizzy hair comes right straight it works great!! And omg the smell is so so nice! Highly recommend üëå"
"It does protect my hair from iron heat"
"This beach hair tool is a game-changer for anyone looking to achieve effortless, sun-kissed waves without the hassle. Compact and easy to use, a good beach hair tool is a must for anyone who wants that relaxed, vacation-ready look year-round."
"So my natural hair is curly wavy and straight in all the wrong places. It's frizzy and just not cooperative.  Straightening my hair took me forever and always looked flat but nice but dead. I bought this too see if it would make my get ready faster because Straightening my hair everyday took an hour. All I have to say is WOW!!!!!!! Less than 10 mins I was out the door. Let the pictures speak for itself. After whole day the waves looked honestly even better, like perfect loose beach waves. I don't like to spend time on make up and hair, nor do I really know how. But this is my must have now, I fell in love with my hair again."
"it preforms well and you get good results, nice waves and no crimps however the part you put your thumb on for the clamp gets super super hot over time & even the glove doesnt really help with that. besides that its easy to use , light weight and hasnt broken!"
"This was an impulse buy and I love it. Heats up nicely and creates lovely waves. I did not need to use the heat glove that came with iron. I did use a heat spray prior to iron. I have naturally wavy, thick hair. This photo was taken after I had straightened my hair a few days prior."
"It’s really big and bulky so if you don’t mind that, then this is for you. It’s really heavy, but it crimps really quickly : so it’s definitely some thing that I would use if I didn’t mind the bulkiness of it. The heat gets really hot and almost burns the plastic off of it so instead of it being pink it turns black like the pictures in the reviews show! I returned it just because it’s super heavy and big and in the way and just not something that I prefer to use!"
"Works well ! Easy to use!"
"this is great quality for the price and super easy to use. it’s the same size as most hot tools so it fits in a drawer nicely"
"I have medium length and stubborn hair. However, this waver has passed all expectations, and impressed me with how well it waves my hair. In the image, those waves are 3 days old, so they last a long time. In more detail, freshly waved hair is so PRETTY!! The waves stay in good! I got a lot of compliments and I felt amazing in the hair. Though, there are only two temperatures to choose from, so I fear that if you have hair that can’t tolerate high heat, this waver will damage your hair a lot. Just make sure you use heat protectant/serum! I recommend Mise En Scene Styling Serum, it protects your hair and gives your hair SHINE! Even more, this was my first time using this type of styling tool, so the design was a little bulky, but my hands got used to it in no time. Also, the first time I used this tool, I took about 30ish minutes to do all of my hair. Overall, spectacular product!!!"
"Recommended to me by a friend. So simple to use, no technique or skill needed.It turns out great every time!"
"I've been using this hair waver frequently, and overall, it does a great job creating the waves I want. It includes two heat settings—356°F and 410°F—which work well for me, but they might not be ideal for everyone. If you prefer more control over the heat settings, this could be a limitation. Additionally, it took a bit of getting used to during the first few tries, but once you get the hang of it, it's reliable and easy to use. Despite these minor drawbacks, it has become a regular part of my hair routine!"
"Really like the results this hair tool gives. It takes a little getting used to since it’s quite big compared to a curling iron, but works really well. Very satisfied with my purchase and the beautiful mermaid hair it gives me"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I have not found a hair straightener that has suited me yet after many years of trying various kinds including those that are cheaper and more expensive. I bought this on a whim before a trip because it was listed as a dual voltage product. I have had a good experience with my hot tools, hairdryer brush in the past and so felt that this would be worth a try. I took it on a work trip and was totally shocked and impressed by how hot the tool got and how smooth it felt on my hair, which is wavy/frizzy/East Indian hair. I hate straightening my hair usually because I always experience hair pull, no matter what type of hair straightener I use whether it’s ceramic or titanium. This straightener was extremely smooth to use and required one to two passes for extremely straight hair that lasted. My hair was also quite shiny and smooth. The product heated up very quickly and has a nice digital display and heats up to 455° which is beyond what most of my other straighteners go up to. It has an indicator light to let you know that the product is ready to use, and it also has an auto shut off, although it will stay on for quite a long time without turning off up to two hours, I believe… I also attempted to use the flat iron to give my hair a slight curl one day and I was able to do this quite easily even though I am almost never able to manage, curling my hair with a flat iron with other tools that I’ve had… I don’t feel satisfied with many hair tools, but was happily surprised with this one and felt that I needed to leave a review as various good reviews helped me choose this product quickly… I used this product while abroad in Europe with a simple travel adapter and it worked beautifully. It does get hot near the plates and you have to be careful when you are holding the flat iron too close to the plates but they do include a heat resistant glove with the product, I just don’t typically use it.I recommend this product, although I cannot speak to the longevity of it as I’ve only been using it for a little over a week. I do have a good experience with hot tools and I’m hopeful that I just saved myself a lot of money investing in a more expensive product because this one is fantastic.One other thing as a bonus is that there is a lock to keep the hair straightener plates closed, which is a nice change from my old one that stays open unless covered with a plastic cover piece.I purchased the 1 1/4 inch product"
"I haven’t gotten a new straightener in like 10 years. When I tell you the DIFFERENCE in this one and my old one… 😮‍💨First off, it has a very sheek design and the black color is nice. I like the round barrel to potentially use this to curl as well as straighten. I also love that this does not snag my hair while straightening (unlike my old one). The straightener itself is lightweight and easy to store since it is not bulky.The speed with which this heated up is INSANE!!! Less than 10 seconds and it was at 395 degrees!!! My old one took at least 10 minutes to get hot.I bought this at a discounted price for cyber monday and it is well worth the money. It straightens my hair quickly to pin straight and instantly removes frizz. I am in love!"
"My stylist recommended this & it works great. Hair glides thru, heats up quick & easy to use.  Glove isn't great as heat protector."
"These flat irons are absolutely my favorite. They work really well. They get nice and hot. It’s worth the price. It doesn’t damage my hair like other flat irons it grips the hair well. It leaves my thick hair with a beautiful bounce and shine to it."
"I love that this tool is curved or rounded. It is so easy to curl my hair with it! I’m not a pro by any means but I curl my hair faster with this than I do a beachwaver, I also feel like it’s easier with this tool. I have a very good grip on it, and the temperature on it is just immaculate. It heats up very quickly and is easy to operate. I love that it spins with you while you’re curling your hair. My hair is not frizzy and it doesn’t feel fried after I use this tool either. Over all the quality is amazing, and I have dropped it a couple of times and it’s not even scratched! I highly recommend this product."
"I was considering ordering this on the hot tools website with the limited lifetime warranty, but for half the price I decided to get it on Amazon. Although I just got it and only used it once so far, I'm pleased. I can't believe how fast it heats up! I have not bought a new straightener in almost 10 years so I'm used to much older technology. I genuinely can't believe how fast this heated. It's nothing too fancy, has a range of heat settings and is comfortable to hold. I went from a 1.5"" plate to this 1"" plate but this works well, heats well, and for the price it can't be beat. Curls well, I'm just struggling to get it to hold the wave technique. I feel like with my thinner blonde hair and the level of heat it should hold more and make more dramatic dents in the hair, but overall it works great for the price."
"I’ve been searching for a good hair iron for a while. It was recommended by my hair stylist. The heat controls are very good with a sound sensor to indicate the iron is heated to desired temperature. Great value. The brand is great for all hair tools. Easy to hold in the hand. Not too heavy or thick. Makes my hair sleek and does not burn. I appreciate the heat protection glove included with the product."
"This is the best hair straightener I’ve owned in a while!! I’ve gotten so many compliments about my hair. It heats up so fast and it even straighten my annoying postpartum hair. Definitely recommend!"
"I purchased the HOT TOOLS Professional Black Gold Micro-Shine Flat Iron and it is truly Professional! I have thick, course hair and it straightens and curls my hair quickly!  This flat iron heats up in seconds and my hairstyle holds for days."
"Looooved it, my hair is very thin and this one suits my hair very well, my hair doesn’t stick anymore"
"Heats up very fast and really efficient at straightening my flyaways/curls."
"Lovely,all in one,very effective,heats quickly,durable,value for money.I would recommend"
"I bought for my teenage granddaughter. She loves it.  Said it was easy to use. Price and quality great."
"This does work well! Love that I can change the barrels however be careful leaving it plugged in as it can be turned on very easily. Mine fell off my counter and in the process turned on and left a burn mark on my floor. It was caught before anything serious like a fire could happen unfortunately for my husband it was his bare foot that found it. Now it gets unplugged after use and put in a vented hanging metal holder to cool."
"This is the perfect curling wand if you like to switch it up everyone and then. (The sizes of your curls) one thing I do recommend tho is investing into some selves to go with it bc the wand gets supper hot and burns within seconds of a tap to ur skinüòÇü§ûüèªother than that I love it!üòÇü§ûüèª"
"Birthday gift for my sister. It heats fast.. doesn‚Äôt burn hands and comes with multiple options.. had to buy a second one for myself"
"okay i don‚Äôt usually review stuff but i wanted to say something about this curler. i love this thing so much, its so much easier to buy this thing rather than a whole bunch of different curlers. my hair doesn‚Äôt usually take heat really well and it just doesn‚Äôt hold a curl, however this curler worked really well for me. i‚Äôve seen some people say that the leg pops out sometimes, but if you hear a click when it pops in it won‚Äôt fall out. i really recommend this and it‚Äôs so worth the price!!"
"I‚Äôve never written a review but if I can help at least one person, this is so worth it. I had curled my hair and shut the iron off, a couple minutes later I heard some popping noises and sparks flying. I look over and apparently the cord was sitting too close to the iron, and literally caught on fire. Burned the rug, the mat is was sitting on as well. Literally went up in flames. I had tried so many times to fix the cord from being all coiled up but could never get it to lay flat. Thank god I was home when this happened and took the appropriate action otherwise idk if I would still have a house."
"I bought this 6 months ago. Initially I really enjoyed the quality and versatility and ease of switching out the tools. However, as time has gone on, it causes weird smelling hair. Even with proper use partnered with thermal protectant hair products. Also, multiple times the 3 barrel waver attachment has detached from the handle while using which results in pain as it‚Äôs caught in my hair along with having to snap it back in - the tool has bent and is now not usable. It‚Äôs unsafe. I‚Äôm beyond my return window or else I‚Äôd be returning for a full refund. Very disappointed given the cost."
"Amazing product.  Looks totally expensive and high quality.  Boxed up beautifully and all attachments are of high standard.  Not cheap at all.  Fast heating time. All attachments fit well into barrel.  Lovely colour too. You don't need to spend more.  Easy passes as an expensive high end hair curler. All the sizes are a bonus too. Glove is essential.  Wasn't sure if to buy this but I was happily surprised"
"These are perfect. My daughter loves to pick out which ones she wants it makes doing her hair more exciting. Now that we can finally do things with her hair these are the way to go!"
"I ONLY use the clear ones and I’ve had this since Feb 2024 (it is not Oct 2024) & I’m not even halfway through the clear ones. Next time I’ll only buy the clear ones. I use at least 6 a day too. So it’s not like I’m using 1 or 2 a day. Love these!  The black ones have more stretch to them. It takes more to wrap them around the hair. That’s the only problem I have with the black. Which, may not even be a problem for someone else. But I have a squirmy toddler and can’t be fighting with a rubber band lol."
"Works great"
"I have super thick hair and sometimes certain bands would snap. These hold ALL day! Sometimes they snap when I go to use them but once they are in they stay!"
"Does exactly what it needs!"
"Although there are so many, they tend to get stuck to each other. They hold pretty well in the hair, but almost glue together to the point that taking them off is a hassle. Using the blade they provide is helpful, but it also cuts off some hair. Use with discretion."
"I absolutely love this set and everything included on it"
"I bought two bottles during Prime Day. I wasn't expecting a lot because my hair is thin and is not easy to maintain. I was very pleasantly surprised at the results! My hair is so soft! It's shiny and I don't have to wash it as often as I used to. I'm 63 and have blonde hair. The spray is a fine mist and not oily."
"The last thermal protector I had was from Tresemme. This one is SO MUCH BETTER! It makes my hair nice and shiny after blow drying while also taming flyaways and frizz. It also smells so good! My hair also isn't weighed down or left greasy after using this project. I will definitely repurchase."
"I really like this product. Great for blow drying - makes your hair super soft. Very shiny."
"Works well with my heated brush, but very small bottle for the price. Besides being very costly, I love the product."
"This product is everything L'ange and it's social media influencers claim it to be. My blow out hairdrying brush went through every strand of my hair like butter. My hair is not weighed down, it is shiny, it definitely has a weightless feel. My only complaint is that it smells a bit like wasp spray, I hate to say that, because it is an awesome product, but once I dried my hair I could only smell my shampoo. I will definitely buy this product again though, smell or not, it is amazing."
"The product works great on my hair but the smell is awful.  It's so overwhelming I have to leave the room for a good 20 mins after using it.  I think the smell is just terrible."
"this has been the best heat protectant spray i have ever found. I have thick curly course hair and this by far makes my hair shiny and silky feeling. I cannot believe the fly aways and frizz is at an all time minimum when using this compared to other products. Highly recommend !!!"
"This project is magical and I‚Äôm obsessed. I hope they never stop making it. I‚Äôve tried 1 million hair products and there‚Äôs nothing I would rave about this product and my hair has never looked better. I‚Äôm not sure how it works. I put it on damp hair and blow dry. My styles are smooth and fresh looking like I went to a salon. I use it the next day on dry hair to refresh my bangs and ends with wonderful results. If you were skeptical by this product, it is seriously life-changing. I liked it so much. I gave some to a girlfriend and three days later she texted me saying she was obsessed and doesn‚Äôt know how she‚Äôs lived this long without it. Because of my utter amazement of this product , I am now purchasing a handful of other products that this line makes. I‚Äôm hopeful they are half as good as the blowout primer. Fabulous fabulous fabulous product!! You will thank me later‚Ä¶"
"This product is awesome!  My hair is silky soft. Frizz is gone, shiny and it doesn‚Äôt weigh your hair down !"
"Glasse makes my hair smooth and shiny when I blow dry it. My hair is usually frizzy and dull. A little goes a long way. I always have my cupboard stocked with it."
"This product is a game changer for me.  I have fine, curly hair and when I straighten it, it's always frizzy.  Trying the Glass Hair Primer has tamed my frizz!  I have tried so many products and I'm really pleased I found this one!  I will be a repeat buyer!"
"Makes your hair completely soft without any frizz at all!Just like in a hair salon!"
"First time I have used this Lange product, I love it!! Goes in nice and light and it makes your hair so nice and shiny, will buy this again!"
"I never thought I would say this, but it is worth every penny. It is super expensive, but man does my hair look great. It‚Äôs healthier and the style last longer than when I use other devices. I am very inept at styling my own hair. This has made it very easy for me to get to salon quality results. I found it easy to learn how to use the device. The noise level is great. It‚Äôs less noisy than a hairdryer and it drys my hair so dang quick. I love it!"
"If you will take it abroad, keep in mind that it will not work in a 220V country. Finding a voltage /wattage converter for a 1300W equipment is not an easy task, it is likely that the converter will be huge in size and will cost you half the price of the Dyson Airwrap itself."
"Bought on Oct 7, 2024 and received it same day via prime shipping.  Bought through Amazon and not a third party seller.  I am freaking out.  This product cost me nearly $640 (including taxes).  It was a gift to my partner and was a list minute surprise.  We are both in shocked that the ‚Äúnew‚Äù airwrap was NOT WORKING.  I was skeptical about some of the reviews.  Some stating it came used or it will blink and you have to clean the filter and it will continue to work.  That wasn‚Äôt the case for us.  A new product should have worked right away without issues.  When turning the device on, it will make a slight noise for two seconds then flash.  Tired multiple times turning off/on, changing plug ports, cleaning the filter at the bottom of the handle, letting it on for a while‚Ä¶. Nothing.  Seems like many people are having the same problem.  I had to return it post office quickly.  I hope Amazon/Dyson will not have any issues giving us a full refund.  Now we decided to stay away from Dyson products.  Quality has gone down hill."
"I considered the Dyson Airwrap for a couple of years and finally chose to buy through Amazon for ease in returning if needed.  BUT- wow this tool is simply in a class by itself.  I have medium length hair and use all the attachments.  It does exactly what it claims- and is so efficient and works so well I can't imagine using the three hair tools I have for years again.  It is costly- but worth it."
"FYI -  if you have a cosmetology license you can purchase directly from Dyson with an $150 trade discount.I learned about the Dyson Stick after discussing my woes about how I‚Äôd dry my waist length hair while wearing a cast on my hand for 7 weeks post surgery. She lent me her Dyson as the attachable brush allowed me to dry/style my hair with one hand! What a game changer. It also dries the hair much quicker than my current professional dryer, while sealing the cuticle ‚Äî leaving it very smooth looking and soft feeling. While the dryer has a high price tag for non stylists, it‚Äôs only slightly higher priced than what I‚Äôd normally spend on a professional high speed, well balanced, powerful dryer. Hopefully, the motor on the Dyson is comparable to my other dryers ‚Äî in quality and longevity.Con ‚Äî the case it comes in. While pretty looking,  it‚Äôs useless. When I order my dryer, I‚Äôll purchases a cloth caddy that can attach to a wall with adhesive for storage and easy access!  It IS easy to travel with - as it takes up minimal space.The limited edition dark blue color dryer is only offered at a few select department stores. Long story short ‚Äî I highly recommend the Dyson Stick!"
"This product is amazing.  I haven't even tried all the attachments, I just love the rocking brush attachment.  It's been a game changer.  It is so quick to do my hair in the morning, and it is so straight and smooth.  I love it.  Am so happy.  I also tried the Shark version of this, but the motor was too high pitched for my ears.  This one is still loud and high-pitched, but not as bad."
"It cuts drying time in half and leaves hair shiny, smooth & styled. Only complaint is the size of the entire package"
"I have had this product for 6 months or so. I‚Äôve used to every single time after I wash my hair.This product has definitely been life changing but my hair type makes it difficult to get the best results. I don‚Äôt get the shiny, sleek look that everyone wants. I still have some frizz but it reduced it a lot.I love all the attachments they include. Unfortunately I barely use the barrels for curls. In order to get good curls, you have to straighten your hair or it will be a mess. I have a difficult time  ‚Äústraightening‚Äù my hair when using the attachments. So you might need a straighter if you want the best optimal curls.Keep in mind, I need to get better with it and I‚Äôm learning. I‚Äôm getting better with them and each time I‚Äôve reduced my time a lot. It‚Äôs a really good product, with learning curve. It‚Äôs easy to use once you get the hang of it. It‚Äôs lightweight which is a big plus. If you have hair like mine, it will still look a bit frizzy.When it comes to value, I don‚Äôt regret spending the money I used to buy this. I love it, I look forward to washing my hair because of this product üòÖ"
"Gran producto"
"What a life changing experience. I have very long hair and I used three of the attachments on my hair the first time. I think with some practice I will be able to master this product"
"I didn‚Äôt get the diffuser or the wide brush attachment, but I did get everything else and it is just as described, also the serial number worked"
"I like the product in all aspects (packing ,delivery & quality )"
"I am 66 and don‚Äôt like fixing my hair. I have very fine hair and I cut it in soft layers.I was terrified of how I could fix it.  When my hair is wet, it is curly.I bought this big barrel curling iron and thought for the price,  If it doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll give it to one of the grandkids.  From the very first time I used it it was very easy to use.  It took out all of the tight curls and made my hair loose.Super easy to hold, super easy to use, you can adjust the temperature to what you need, and a great price.I put it on number one because my hair is fine and it has highlights in it.And this is how it softened my hair to big loose curls.And a big plus for me is my hair doesn‚Äôt get hung in it at all.I do love it."
"Listen! Great but! Curls came out popping! Great product, easy to use. Definitely buying it in a different size"
"I've Been sreaching for a good curling wand for the past two months now, am really amazed with this one just what I wanted perfect sizing, good quality,very smooth, lightweight, nicely designed and heats up very quickly up to 356¬∞F. It's a must buy ü•∞"
"I like the fact that it‚Äôs light weight, heats up fast and I love the color. Can‚Äôt wait to install my wig and give it some nice bouncy curls !!"
"I love it so far. It's the perfect size for making my short, shaggy, mullet-y haircut a bit wavy and textured. Heats up quickly and very easily curls my REALLY thick, pin straight hair. Also, great size to take with me in a bag! Not too big or bulky; very light, simple, and easy to use.Though, PLEASE watch out for your poor neck and ears! This thing comes with a nasty bite if you accidentally touch the iron to any part of your skin. Just a precaution, nothing against how well the product works. Didn't leave any embarrassing burn marks, so that's good."
"I bought this for when I travel out of the country so I wouldn‚Äôt be devastated if an expensive hair tool short circuited. I LOVED the bouncy curl it gave me so much, I was using it at home some too! The larger barrel was perfect for a loose curl/blow out look. I have really long fine hair, but a lot of it! And I could curl my whole head in under 5 minutes. But less than a 10 months after purchasing, it all of sudden stopped heating up, like at all! I maybe used it less than 30 times. I noticed a weird burning smell coming from it despite me having it on a very low setting, and the next time I turned it on, it wouldn‚Äôt heat up at allll. That being said, it was less $20‚Ä¶ So I guess I got at least $20 of use from it."

"The curling iron is good. It heats up very quickly and curls hair fast. I had curling iron on turbo and on #5. I counted 5 seconds and the hair was already curled. Old iron takes 20 seconds.  But be careful you can burn your hair. The barrel is longer too. You can burn yourself or your client. The white tip is cool, but short; I kept burning my fingers. The dial is very easy to twist while curling hair. Too close to the release bar."
"Nice curler, gets the job done and still it great condition after 4 years"
"Gives a nice tight curl"
"It‚Äôs been several months of regular use of this hair tool.  It‚Äôs still working perfectly.  Every once in a while I accidentally hit the power button but it‚Äôs quick to reheat"
"I am in love with my Tymo iconic plus. I have very thick ,frizzy curly hair. It always takes a while to straighten. However, this wonderful straightening brush has made my mornings so much easier and less stressful since hair styling time has been significantly cut down. This hair brush heats up to 450 degrees and literally in one pass my frizz is smoothed out and my curls are straight as can be. I can also do large sections which cuts the styling time down tremendously. Its a very quick heat up. I love how the display shows the brush getting to its temp you set it to so you know when its ready to use if you don't hear the beep. I also get that wavy bump on the back of my head which is very hard to get with a normal straightener but once again this brush is able to smooth it out. I cant say enough great things about this. Highly recommend. Side note: I have also tried the Tymo Ring comb the older version and also newer version and neither one of this compare to the brush!!"
"Love this product. Does not pull your hair. I can quickly straighten my thick curly hair, took less than 10 minutes. So easy to use, turn on, quick heat up, brush thru hair, done!! Great price."
"I brought this on a whim, hoping it would have decent results. It works really well. I have 4B hair and it can be a little extra wavy sometimes. this brush tool really did straighten my hair and it did it in about 20 minutes sectioned and four parts. The brush heats up pretty quickly and gets really hot. I found the back of the brush was hot to the touch, but I was able to lay it down and not burn any surfaces. The only thing I would advise, is to be sure to remove any lose hair from the brush immediately after each pass. It seems to generate a bit of smoke if you don’t. Overall and pleased with it. I could go over my hair at the root with a flat iron maybe but it’s straighten my hair well."
"It has been a total lifesaver, a real answer to my prayers. I just love it, it works amazingly and it’s much much easier for me to use, it’s simple but heavy duty enough to straighten even my frizzy corse hard to manage hair so now I’m able to straighten all of my hair without frustration or total exhaustion, before my arms shoulders & neck would hurt so bad from trying to straighten each part of my hair section & piece by piece with my regular hair straightener but I just couldn’t do it with my weakened health conditions & disabling limitations I was only able to find the strength tolerance & endurance to straighten the front of my hair but now with this new heavy duty straightening heat brush it will straighten all of my hair just by brushing my hair several times which is a whole lot easier than any thing else I’ve ever tried, there’s no secret to it. It heats up fast & it will get pretty hot so be extra cautious & careful but other than that I love it. It’s a total game changer, I look & feel 25 yrs younger just by being able to do my hair the way I’ve always wanted hoped & dreamed I have never like my hair but now I love it more than anything, my hair is beautiful soft straight manageable and I can actually run my fingers through my hair without getting caught or stuck all because of this wonderful product. it’s amazing. Thank you so very very much. God Bless I highly recommend it."
"I am 50 years old and I have had curly hair my entire life. Ringlet style curls. Serious curls. I have never been able to achieve straight hair. This hair straightener is nothing short of amazing. It heats up in seconds (no exaggeration), it doesn’t burn or damage the hair, and the entire process took about five minutes. I cannot believe how well it works. I am not a ‘girly girl’ and I still was able to achieve amazing results with this product. I would buy this product again and again. I absolutely love it."
"This was not the quick, easy, make your hair straight and silky tool that I thought it would be.  I read 100s of reviews and waited for the ""hype"" to die down before I tried it, because it sounded too good to be true.Maybe the results vary drastically based on hair type but for reference, I have ethnic hair that is long and naturally curly.  Without a ton of product in it, if I let it air dry, it will get very poofy.  When I want to wear my hair straight, I have to get it done professionally.  The best I can do on my own after 45 minutes of blow drying and taking little strips of hair to flat iron for another 45 minutes...is semi-straight hair.  It still has some significant poof to it.This brush didn't do any better.  It straightened my hair a bit, but it was still poofy.  I tried the highest temperature as well as doing smaller strips of hair and it just made my hair hot. I used a heat protectant too and that didn't seem to make any difference.  I'm not a stylist or a product design engineer, but I think the design of the brush doesn't pull the hair tight enough to get all of the wave out.  When the stylist straightens my hair, she  brushes a small section and pulls my hair tight as she runs the flat iron over it.Companies pay/incentivize for people to post positive product reviews as well as AI generated reviews, so not sure if that was the case with this product? I find it very hard to believe that this tool can produce the straight, silky look on it's own without the help of a flat iron.  But maybe it can.It just didn't work for me."
"I can hardly believe how good this works. Takes my hair from unruly to sleek and smooth in a matter of minutes.  So glad I made the purchase, definitely the best hair appliance I have ever used!"
"So first off I love this brush... It heats up within seconds and does what it is supposed to do...Now I have 4a frizzy hair I took the heat up to 410. It definitely straightened my hair and gave it a blow out look! That being said it is not going to give you a sleek silk press look - you might want the airflow flat iron instead if that is the look you want to achieve.I like using it on my wigs - makes life easier to comb the hair (with this heat brush) after washing and drying then I go in a flattening with a flat iron."
"This hair straightener and brush combo is an absolute game-changer. It works so fast and is incredibly easy to use — perfect for someone like me who's always in a rush. In just a few minutes, my hair looks smooth and sleek, and the best part? It doesn't burn or damage my hair at all! It's gentle, yet super effective, leaving my hair looking great without any hassle. Honestly, it's a lazy person’s dream tool. If you're looking for a quick, safe, and easy way to straighten your hair, this is it! Highly recommend!"
"I can’t say enough good things about this curling crimper! It gives me those perfect beachy waves in just minutes, and they last all day. The plates heat up super quickly, and the crimper is easy to use, even for someone like me who isn’t a pro at styling. I love how it adds volume and texture to my hair without making it frizzy. Plus, it has adjustable heat settings, so I can use a lower heat when I want to be more gentle on my hair. This tool has seriously cut my styling time in half. If you’re looking for gorgeous, long-lasting waves, this crimper is a must-have!"
"This works great! I was excited to try it and I did my entire head in about 10 minutes, it heats up fast, works fast, and looks great as an end result,I would definitely recommend to it. This product really exceded expectations. And it's so easy to use, no twisting your... Ver más"
"I recently got my hands on the Allure Three Barrel Curling Wand, and I’m pretty impressed! It creates those gorgeous beachy waves in no time, which is perfect for my busy mornings. The three-barrel design makes it super easy to use, and I love how quickly it heats up. My only minor gripe is that it can be a bit tricky to maneuver at first, but once you get the hang of it, the results are totally worth it. Overall, a solid 4 stars for effortless, beautiful waves!"
"This curling iron is amazing! It’s super easy to use, heats up quickly, and gives me perfect curls every timeI’m really happy with this curling iron. It’s lightweight, efficient, and my curls last all day.Great quality for the price. Heats evenly, doesn’t snag my hair.Highly recommended!"
"I can’t praise this curling crimper enough! It effortlessly creates those perfect beachy waves in just minutes, and they hold beautifully throughout the day. The plates heat up in no time, making it incredibly convenient, and even as someone who isn’t a styling expert, I find it easy to use.What I love most is how it adds both volume and texture to my hair without contributing to frizz. Additionally, the adjustable heat settings allow me to choose a lower temperature when I want to be gentler on my strands. This tool has genuinely halved my styling time, making my mornings much smoother. If you’re after stunning, long-lasting waves, this crimper is an absolute essential!"
"No regrets. It works well with my water wave wigs. The curls are define and last a long time. It is easy to handle and once handle properly you don't get burn easily. I like the led light feature which shows the temperature. Overall good product"
"For lack of a better word, I am the ""fool"" in foolproof when it comes to hair tools. This one genuinely fits the bill for being a tool anyone can figure out. It's simple, easy, relatively lightweight, and doesn't require much effort to do your whole head. Downside that I haven't figured out is it has an auto-shut off (good for not burning your house down!) that happens after about a minute of use, so you have to keep adjusting the temp."
"The Alure Three Barrel Hair Waver is amazing and a must-have hair appliance for effortlessly creating soft, natural-looking waves. Or even adding more body to your hair as it did mine.  Its 1-inch ceramic tourmaline barrels heat evenly, cutting down styling time and delivering smooth, frizz-free results—even on my frizzy hair. The LCD with temp control allows for quick heating and precise adjustments, protecting hair from excessive heat. The dual voltage feature makes it travel-friendly, and despite its triple-barrel design, it’s lightweight and easy to handle. I was thrilled with the boost in body and fullness it gave my lifeless hair—not overly wavy, just the right amount for a fuller look. Highly recommended!"
"I’m thrilled with the results I get from the Remington Shine Therapy 1-Inch Hair Straightener! My hair looks and feels incredibly smooth and shiny every time I use it. The ceramic plates are infused with Moroccan Argan oil, which genuinely makes a difference—I can see the shine right after I finish styling. It heats up quickly and has an adjustable temperature setting, so I can control the heat level and avoid damaging my hair.The slim 1-inch size is perfect for both straightening and adding a little curl to the ends. It glides effortlessly, without pulling or snagging, and my hair stays sleek and frizz-free all day long. It’s also lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it comfortable to use.For anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality straightener that adds shine and smoothness, this one is a fantastic choice. I feel like I’m getting salon results at home—highly recommend!"
"Since I bought the Remington iron, I have noticed a big difference in my hairdressing routine. Its design is elegant and lightweight, which makes it very comfortable to handle. It heats up quickly and offers various temperatures, perfect for different types of hair."
"I recently purchased the Remington Hair Straightener, and I have to say, it has exceeded my expectations! First off, the sleek design is both modern and user-friendly, making it easy to handle while styling. The plates heat up quickly, reaching the desired temperature in no time, which is a huge time-saver during my morning routine.One of the standout features is the advanced ceramic technology that helps reduce frizz and adds a beautiful shine to my hair. The straightener glides smoothly through my hair, and I love how it can tackle both straightening and curling effortlessly. It’s versatile enough to create different styles, whether I want sleek, straight hair or soft waves.I also appreciate the adjustable temperature settings, allowing me to choose the perfect heat level based on my hair type. This feature is crucial for preventing damage, and I feel more confident using it regularly. The auto shut-off feature is a great safety addition, giving me peace of mind if I ever forget to turn it off.Overall, the Remington Hair Straightener is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for an effective and reliable styling tool. It delivers salon-quality results at an affordable price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in search of a new straightener!"
"This works better than the $50 flat iron I had to replace. I was hesitant because  the price so much less than the one I replaced but after reading the reviews I figured I try it. SO glad I did. Heats up fast..is sturdy...it curls and straightens and oh ys, it adds shine! Kudos!!c"
"It works pretty well. The different settings are nice. But I would recommend wiping with a damp cloth (not while plugged in!!!) before the first time you use it. Because I just used it and there was this strong chemical smell, like carcinogens. Hopefully the smell will go away over time. I don't exactly see the ""shiny"" that everyone's talking about either but it's still a good straightener for the price I got it at. It takes 2-3 runs at 370 to flatten my really wavy hair. Also you can change the temperature and it comes with a temperature guide in the manual"
"Smooth, shiny, frizz-free hairThe Remington Shine Therapy straightener has been one of the best investments for my hair care. It straightens quickly thanks to its ceramic plates infused with argan oil and keratin, leaving my hair much shinier and softer to the touch. I also notice a great reduction in frizz, even on humid days. Plus, it reaches the ideal temperature in seconds and is very easy to handle. It is perfect for both straightening and creating soft waves. Totally recommended for those looking for healthy hair with a professional finish!"
"This is hands down the best flat iron I have ever used. It works well. It is exactly as described. It leaves the hair feeling so soft and shiny. It straightens really well. Don’t be discouraged by the price of this flat iron. It works so much better than the expensive ones I have purchased."
"This is literally the best iron I’ve ever used, and I’ve used a lot!  It’s heats up super fast and glides smoothly on my hair, no tugging or snatching.  The built in argan oil and keratin make my hair super shiny and soft.  It curls my hair easily too which I wasn’t expecting.  Highly recommend!!!"
"This straightener heats up extremely fast!!! (20-30 seconds) and it beeps when it is done heating up. Buttons on the side for power and temp control work great and are in a good spot. I don't hit the buttons when I am using it which is a huge bonus. My hair doesn't get snagged or pull. Glides along hair smoothly. It is very sleek looking. My hair is naturally wavy and has some curls and this straightener worked great to straighten them. I didn't have to pass it over my hair multiple times. The cord swivels really easily making it super easy and efficient for use. There is also a small lock at the base of it to lock it closed when not using it.  Hope this review helps."
"My 13 year old hair straightener finally kicked the bucket, so I did some searching around for a replacement and landed on the Remington Shine Therapy 1” Flat Iron, Argan Oil & Keratin Plate Hair Straightener. I was happy with the price and after using it a handful of times I’m even more impressed with the results! This straightener heats up very quickly, it’s light weight, I like that the buttons are on the side (my old one had the power button inside close to the plates and a dial for the heat), and I like that you can lock the straightener closed to store it away. I added a before and after photo of my hair for reference."
"Great little tool to have in your overnight bag. Works great for drying and styling. Two heat speeds and one cool speed. Nice red color. Easy to assemble and disassemble. It works really well and puts away well."
"I purchased this for my mother ... she was looking at these but mentioned that she was not sure if she'd like it, so she did not want me to buy anything expensive and she would upgrade if the concept worked. I had looked at the yellow Blow Dry Bar version of this in a store ... which retailed at around $100 - $200. That version, despite the cost, was only a smaller brush OR a larger brush. This came with two brush sizes. I was very skeptical  about the quality due to the low price. That proved to be unfounded as my mother said that she really, really liked this one and there was no need to upgrade to a more expensive brand.One thing she really mentioned liking is that the chord swivels/rotates as the unit is being used so the chord doesn't get tangled up as you turn the appliance during use. It's lightweight and easily maneuverable and the different brushes are easy to attach and take off.She mentioned it is so much easier to use this than the traditional method of holding the blow drier in one hand and a brush in the other. The hot setting is very hot/too hot ... so the low setting is all she uses, with a quick blast of cool air at the end. She has medium/short hair above her shoulders and fine hair, not thick, so this works well for her. She doesn't do any curling or waving and keeps her hair straight.The big brush is good for body, near the roots. The smaller brush is more for the under part of your hair. It is nice to have both brushes to use ... many more expensive kits only have one brush attachment. This also comes with a blow drier attachment. While it's not as powerful in terms of dispersing air as a regular blow drier, it does a good job of drying hair without having to use a brush. Don't expect to go from fully wet to fully dry in a minute or two, but it will  give you a little bit more shape and body, especially on fine hair.Overall, for under twenty bucks, this thing is amazing. She had fully intended to upgrade to a Dyson after but will keep this unit. It's a little lightweight and flimsy ... but it works as it should. The value and performance is fantastic and it is highly recommended."
"I bought this hot air styling brush kit to replace a similar one that broke after many years of use (I dropped it on a tile floor one too many times). So far, it's been as good for styling my short, fine hair, that has a slight wave in it which tends to flip the wrong way unless I style it - which annoys me, as my old one did. I hope it lasts me as long too. I had my old one just over 10 years! The old one still turned on, even after drop #4, but the handle where it met the electrical cord was too just broken to make it safe to use anymore. No amount of duct tape around it would convince me otherwise.I don't actually bother styling my hair most days, since I work from home, but when I want my hair to have more style, I use this, with a light, natural styling gel, and been happy 90% of the time with the results. The only times I haven't been happy is when I'm in a humid area. Humidity makes my hair go nuts; either it loses all the style I spent time putting in by drooping and going flat, or it gets super wavy, curly, and/or frizzy, which drives me crazy too (I hate having my hair in my face), so I end up using a hair tie and clips to hold it back from my face, and/or I wear a hat. I don't use fixative type hair products due to the toxicity of most of them. I have asthma, very sensitive skin and a sensitive scalp. I breakout from most styling products. Also, most fragrances in most products and sprays, tend to trigger my allergies and/or asthma. Using just this brush and the natural styling gel are really my only options, and work fine, mostly. I deal with it if they don't. They work well together when I'm home in Colorado, most of the time. Humidity here does the same thing as it does anywhere else to my hair though, but it's rarely very humid here.I want to warn everyone, as with all styling brushes and blow dryers, the Revlon Hot Air Brush does get HOT while using it. Not so much the handle where you hold it most of the time, but all the metal parts do, and so does the handle near the styling attachments area. So, please be careful when changing out the attachments, cleaning the brushes, putting it away, or packing it after use. Some parts retain heat for a while. Give them time to cool down, 5-10 minutes, or use something to protect your fingers/hands if you need to change attachments while using it.I also just can't stress these next things enough:1. DO NOT use it near a sink or bathtub with water in it. If you accidentally drop it into water while it's plugged into a wall outlet, you could electrocute yourself, and/or start a fire. It'll be ruined too. Water and most motorized things do not go well together. it's not a waterproof item.2. ALWAYS, when you finish using it, unplug it and leave it on a counter, far away from curious little ones if they are of concern, or hang it up, to allow it to cool off, before you put it away or pack it in a suitcase! The risks of burning someone or something, and/or starting a fire, are real. I scorched a t-shirt slightly, when I went to pack it in my suitcase, before giving it enough time to cool off first. I had wrapped the t-shirt around the handle part, to cushion it in my suitcase. When I unpacked it at home to put it away, I found the scorch mark on the shirt. Lesson learned. Luckily, it wasn't one of my new t-shirts I ruined.3. DO NOT leave it plugged into a wall outlet, even if it's not turned on or hot, and forget about it. Power spikes can damage it, and cause an electrical fire if it sparks. Also, you don't want anything else happening either, such as a young child getting ahold of it.So, yes, I recommend you try the Revlon Hot Air Brush Kit. If you don't like it, return it before the 30 days return period. Just be smart about using it and storing it. If it lasts me 5-10 years, I'll be happy."
"Works well and is smaller than the other trendy stylers. I have both and this one works equally as well as the other and is not so bulky.  Price is good too. Of course, this one is as loud as the others, but that was expected."
"I should have bought this much sooner, I have thick shoulder length hair and this dryer is great. My hair has a noticeable smoothness and bounce. The included barrels are perfect for short/medium length hair, and it has impressive drying power."
"This blower works great for my curly hair! It’s super convenient. I’m a little annoyed at the sudden price drop. I wish I would’ve bought it now that it’s $12. That seems like a reasonable price!"
"I had an earlier model of Revlon’s barrel dryer that was pink & white for over 15 years that finally quit on me. It had the “negative ion” & cool shot. I loved it. When I needed to replace it, I bought this one.Both dryers were loud. I didn’t really care too much about that, because you have to sacrifice something at this price point.The old pink one was great at giving my fine limp hair volume but not giving me the fuzzy (I’m blonde with help from my hairdresser) muppet look.I figured the new model would be at the very least, as effective.Nope.I got volume alright, but as an added bonus, it made my hair look like cotton candy.I added some heat protection spray the next time in addition to my other products and still, very frizzy.Thankfully I could return it. Lessons learned: most of the time you get what you pay for, & nothing is made as well as it used to be. I wasn’t planning on leaving a review. So I didn’t take any photos of my electrified do. Apologies."
"I love this product. Very cost effective, work great for me. I use it almost every morning before work, heat is efficient, easy to hold and comes with different size curlers which is great. Small enough to be carried in luggage. I bought two so far."
"With the heat it's body melt then it damaged"
"When I got this it had a USA plug in it so I sent it back.  I didn’t want to risk getting another  one so I left it.  It’s not the item I wasn’t happy with I just didn’t like not being able to use it."
"UPDATE 4/22/2023: Been about 3 1/2 years and this thing is still going strong.  Staying nice and sharp.  I've noticed getting my hair cut down the street that some of the barbers use these as well.  If this breaks I'm definitely buying the exact same one again if it's still around.____________________________My main goal for my hair is just in beard/stubble trimming.  I am not a professional and I don't cut my own hair.  The goal for my trimmers is that they provide reasonably close trimming on the sensitive skin of my face, since I can't use a regular razor.  Also, I want something that is quality, and I would rather spend more for something that lasts.  My last requirement is that the trimmer be wireless.  With that as the background:The first trimmer I ever bought worked surprisingly well for being so cheap, about $35.  It was a ConairMAN HC1100R.  Holds a charge well, powerful motor, close-enough shave for the neck area.  Only problem is the mechanism for tapering the blade would break after months of going back and forth between neck and face (adjusting for longer length on the face).  This caused the blade to become unstable, loud, and cut poorly.  I've been through three of these things, and when my third one just broke in October of 2019 despite being purchased in February, I decided I needed to move on.In a hurry I purchased the Wahl 8290 which I have nothing bad to say about because I never used it.  My genius self didn't bother to realize it's not cordless.I next jumped on the GOOLEEEN hair clippers, cordless, LED display, IPX7 waterproof, and advertised as ""professional.""  Long story short, the motor sounds and feels weak, the cutting mechanism is half plastic, and the thing was immediately tugging out my hair even in already short and not very dense facial hair.After a bit more research, I decided to try the ConairMAN Super Stubble, also with a waterproof rating.  This one has a pre-attached motorized guard that you can adjust digitally.  I can't believe I spent $112 on this thing.  The motor feels weak and cheap, and the whole unit feels a little cheap.  The guard itself is a nice try at innovation but something about it made it take waaaay more passes to evenly cut my facial hair, like I've ever experienced before.  And no matter how many passes I did take, it still never quite felt like I was done.  Also, that tiny motor that adjusts the guard seems like it will be the first thing that breaks, which is crazy because one of the ""features"" of the device is that the motor automatically returns the guard to a preset length when you turn the device off, and then returns yet again to whatever length you were using previously once you turn it back on.  Meaning there are a ton of unnecessary movements of the motor that are only going to ensure it's the first thing to go.  The only positive thing I can say is that when you flip the guard back and just use the blade without the guard, you get a pretty close cut, so close it actually cut my skin a little bit but nothing terrible.After doing even more research, watching more youtube videos, etc., I finally landed on this, the Wahl 8148.  At about $30 less than the Super Stubble, I'm very happy.  I'd be happy even if it were the same price as the Super Stubble.  The motor feels strong (though it seems to be comparably louder than some other nice professional models I saw reviewed).  The unit feels sturdy, and the blades make quick and even work of my facial hair just like my first Conair.  I also like that, unlike all the other models I tried, the tapering bar for the blade operates on a smooth gradient, not large clicking progressions.  Meaning you can be extra meticulous in your blending which seems extra useful when you're working with hair that's overall short to begin with.  You can operate cordless or plugged in.  Some reviews complain there's more power when the unit is plugged in, but in my opinion that's a feature, not a flaw.  This means the unit can utilized the extra draw from the wall that you probably can't get from a lithium ion battery alone, if you need that extra power for whatever reason.I expect this thing to easily provide years of reliable use and I will definitely be back to post an update if not."
"I love that Wahl supporters the American worker.  And as long as they continue to do so, I will support and buy from them ALWAYS.  My last clipper I bought almost 20 years ago from Wahl, finally hit the bucket.  The wire broke from too much twisting.  And it was near where it goes into the clipper.  So, I could not strip the wire and reconnect.  So, I wanted a quality product, but more importantly, support my fellow Americans.  So, I knew who to turn to.  And of course, I was not disappointed.  This clip is wireless.  But you do have the option to use the charging wire if you want.  But as long as you charge it, it will hold a charge for a long time.  The motor noise is very smooth an quiet.  No need to adjust the motor speed like the other ones they sell for $20-$40 ish dollars.  This is a one speed.  You can adjust the height of the blade.  Comes with a few clipper blades.  I would recommend if you want to use it for longer hair cuts, to purchase a set that comes with small to very tall blades, like the #10, 12, 14, etc.  They are found on Amazon.  It also comes with a brush and oil, with instructions.  It does not come with a barber robe.  You will have to purchase that separate if you want to keep the hair off of you.  They have nice ones on Amazon for like $15-$25 dollars.  The one I got is very nice and has a hair brush to get all the small hairs off.  Some people might look at the $90 dollar price and say that is too much.  Even say, all I need is a $30 one and it does everything I need.  And that may be true.  But having both of the price ones, I can tell you, especially if you cut your hair a bit long, over an inch, this is the way to go.  With clean hair, and a proper oiled blade, this not only cuts quick, but gives you an even cut.  So, when your hair starts to grow, it won't grow uneven because of the clipper.  The hair does not get caught in the blades, which may cause pulling.  And having it portable, makes it easy to take it with you, and do hair cuts any where.  It is very annoying cutting hair with the cord in the way and hitting myself or my kids face or head.  I highly recommend this over the $30-$40 ish dollar ones.  But whatever you decide to do, stick with Wahl and support your fellow American jobs.  Without them having jobs, they cannot buy your products or services.  It is not one companies job to create American jobs, so the other companies can have sweat shops in China to have record profit ""margins.""  Buy American, save our country.  This is the first review in over 150 that I can say, ""Made in the USA."""

"The product was delivered quickly. The hair dryer bag and other accessories look very good at first glance. I had to return it because when I plugged it in and the hair dryer heated up, it caused the light in my bathroom to flicker. It remains unclear what this is connected with."
"This product‚Äôs design is so pretty! My daughter loves pink and it‚Äôs also super easy to use! The attachments were fun and easy to understand. The curling ability was superb!"
"I LOVE this product, it's like have a hairdresser at home, multiuse,  worth every penny, practical to go everywhere, the material is great you can have your hair done so easy, don't pay more in hairsalon, It dry my hair in 20min with a beautiful curls, light weight,  is not noise, the bag is beautiful and glamorous, it bring glove for the curl,"

You can set temperature as your wish and style your hair. This work perfect for my curly hair and make my hair manageable. I am very satisfied with the purchase I made and money I invest on it."
"I used to use this back in middle school and re ordered them for my daughter to use them. They work great and super sturdy."
"In the early stages of fixing my daughters hair and this tool is a lifesaver. Makes the simplest hair style so elegant!"
"Better quality than many of these. Still would go with the brand name as they all tend to be super cheap and bendy."
"As an on site bridal hair stylist, I am always trying to keep up with the newest trends. This tool has been essential to my bridal bag! They make styling so much easier ! The flexibility of the tool, and the different sizes are a great asset. I’ve been recommending them to everyone!"
"Great seller product was as described"
"If you have easy to handle hair it's good but it you have hard to handle hair, it's going to hurt to pull through. I loosen up the ponytail and still hurts! Lord have mercy. I'll give it as a gift."
"Good quality weight to them. The last bunch I bought were so flimsy they would snag hair because they were too floppy."
"Good and does the job intended"
"These towels are so soft and thick and really do help dry my curly hair.  I like the colors I selected, they are true to what his pictured and they are a nice size.  I previously ordered other towels for my curly hair and they were very thin and did not wash well these are super thick, super absorbent and very comfortable to wear.  Great purchase."
"Really love this microfiber towel for drying my hair naturally without using heat. Have to say the price was really nice for receiving three of them. I've never used them before and must say I really love them and will purchase more and use them for now o. I love the way they feel and the water it gets out of my hair. So much better than a towel and easier on the hair with no pulling or damaging happening anymore. Plus they actually look cute on unlike a towel so that's also a plus. Nice to buy things and they work like they should and hoped for. These microfiber head towels are just great!"
"So soft and easy to use. Helps dry my hair and not damage it like other towels. My hair is very thin and fine and can use all the help I can get to keep it healthy. These stay well and are very soft. No heavy on my head and do not pull my hair. Colors are super cute too!"
"These hair turbans are nice and thick and feel luxurious, but have an elastic loop and a button on the bottom to keep it in place. The elastic band is on the inside and is so small and tight that it is hard to get it on the button. I struggle with it each time I use it after washing my hair. I will keep the set because they are absorbent and soft."
"These hair towels are fantastic!  I had read the reviews and was surprised when they arrived in such a tiny package!  However, once they were opened they expanded and were very soft!  It was easy to wrap and swaddle my hair and the button was easy to access and kept my hair in place while absorbing a large majority of the water. Highly recommend!"
"These were a great value for the high quality microfiber hair towels. The package contained three hair towels that were pretty colors. These hair towels make drying my hair quicker and were extremely easy to use. Upon opening the vacuum sealed packaging, there were no apparent bad odors. The manufacturer provided easy to follow directions on the steps to take prior to use. These are easy to use in addition to being very soft and fluffy!"
"These are perfect for drying hair, fit well, and easy to use , love the softness and colors , great buy"
"I am impressed with how well these towels retain water. Especially considering my hair is just below my shoulders, and thick. They work surprisingly well and are lightweight, even wet, and they dry fast once they are hung up. I definitely recommend."
"A very good quality for this price"
"Lovely product"
"Backstory: was interested in the Dyson, then Shark, but couldn’t justify the cost. I have T3’s curlers and DryBars dry brush, so I had the individual tools.Sephora Sale, I saw the Bondi with great stars, could buy it for $150, so I immediately pulled the trigger. Ended up returning it, and bought this for $70 more during Black Friday. Including my review of both products in case it’s helpful for decision making.BondiInitially: I loved it. I could blow dry my hair in 5 minutes and do a quick blow out in 10-15 minutes.Additional thoughts: 1.) The appliance itself felt cheap compared to my T3, but I had no frame of reference for airstylers.  2.) I hated how hot the styler attachments got, I had to use my hot pad to remove them/put new ones on (like the different direction barrels).  3.) The curls do not last, but I really liked the circular brush/blow out style I was getting, so was still happy. 4.) The air suction isn’t strong, whatsoever. I don’t know the numerics of my hair type, but I am a natural blonde, very fine hair, slightly wavy, but it is very thick and quite long (natural waist maybe?). The air suction on the curlers would barely pick up any of my hair, I truly can’t imagine how it would work on coarser hair. I’m talking 1/3-1/2 of the hair I’d normally section/curl with my iron. 5.) I would get heat marks in my hair during curling, which was super alarming to me (I use protectant, but I do not color my hair) Then, I was using the circular brush, and the whole attachment snapped off. In investigating, the plastic of the the connection would get so hot that it would bend the plastic — making the attachments unusable.SharkImmediately, the appliance is more sturdy, substantial and feels quality. The difference feels like Bondi=Plastic, Shark=Metal.Speed: Dried my roots in 1 minute, root to tip in 4 min, and curled in an additional 9 min.Notable improvements:1.) Better materials2.) No troubles with the heat of attachments, there’s grips at the ends, but the attachements themselves don’t get as hot either making it super easy to change out3.) beautiful curls on the first try, and have lasted this far with no hairspray4.) huge improvement in air suction/strength, I can actually curl normal sections of hair5.) no heat marks thus far!I would highly recommend saving until the Shark is in budget!"
"Just got this today. Initial review-- Dries hair FAST, I have very fine hair but a LOT of it, and this dried my hair in maybe half the time of a regular dryer- I dried my hair on the next to lowest heat setting- it didn’t burn my head at all but was still very effective at drying- I used the curling rods (comes with 2, one for left side and one for right side of head) and was pretty pleased with how easy they were to figure outSee attached photos- for context, I used no products in my hair to combat frizz or add volume, etc. Had just washed my hair and was excited to test this out. Blow dried my hair until it was about 85% dry, and then grabbed a few sections to test the curling rods. I literally half-added this and only curled a small number of sections in my hair, so just know that if you spend more than literally 6 minutes curling your hair with this, I think it’ll look ten times as good.This thing isn’t too heavy, and the attachments are very easy to switch out (they do have a locking mechanism so they don’t fall out while you’re using them). A lot of people have commented on the volume, but honestly- it doesn’t sound any louder to me than a typical blow dryer? The noise is slightly more high pitched than a normal dryer, so maybe that’s what people don’t like, but after 5 seconds of using it the sound literally became white noise to me. Honestly, I think it’s quieter than most hotel dryers.My one complaint isn’t really a complaint, I just didn’t read and realize that there’s a different curling wand for each side of the head. So you’ll basically curl one side of your head, then swap out the rod and curl the other side. I kind of wish it was just one rod to do the whole head, but with how they’re designed that wouldn’t work (unless you didn’t care about which way the curls face.) Each rod is clearly marked on the end with an L or an R so there’s no guesswork.As someone who loves to have nice hair but is infinitely lazy and unskilled with a curling iron or round brush, this seems like it was very well worth the purchase for me. If you’re already a pro at doing hair, you might not get as much use out of this set, but for me I’m very happy with the purchase.I chose this over the dyson because of the price point, but also because I’ve owned other products (vacuums lol) from each brand and I’ve found Shark products to be more reliable and dependable than Dyson stuff.Update: two weeks in and I’m loving this. Surprisingly, my favorite attachment is the round brush. It’s so easy to use that with the dryer to dry my hair and give it volume so my roots aren’t so flat. This thing also travels well- when your straighten out the dryer barrel, this was super easy for me to fit in my carry on bag and then I just threw the paddle brush attachment in my backpack. Easy peasy and I was able to use it to keep my hair looking full and lovely on a long weekend trip to the lake. Very happy with this purchase.Edit 2- 2 month update. I freaking love this thing. I actually don’t use the curling wands very often- I’ve been using both brush options to get volume and even curls in my hair. I’ve never been skilled (or patient) at doing my hair but this thing has been pretty much a game changer for me. Walked out of the house the other day looking like I had just gotten my hair professionally done, felt like a goddess."
"I have very thick hair and it typically takes me 45 minutes to an hour to style — with the Shark I did everything in less than 20 minutes! It dries it so fast and I love that you can control the air speed and the temperature. I’ve curled it and given myself a blow out and both results were amazing and it’s so easy to use. If you’ve been debating whether to treat yourself to one, take this as your sign to just do it!!!!"
"My wife’s hair looks 20 again."
"Coming from a person who has used both the revlon round brush dryer & the cheap knock off dyson I say this is worth it, if you are wanting a Dyson but don’t want to shell out that amount of money.Pro- fast, powerful, has the same tech for making a blown out curl.Con- buttons could be closer together, needs a longer hair attachment or just 1 singular barrel for curling which can do both ways, & you have to hold the cold shot for a little longer to actually feel it.Never used a real Dyson, but used the knock off which I do not recommend gets too hot & after prolonged use it shorted out. Also using a revlon it’s a good thing for beginners to actually get the hang of trying to get a good blow out with a slight curl but it’s always hot no real temp control & if you are wanting a true cool down to set your curl you will need a standard hair dryer to actually set it. The shark has the power & the comfortability all in one."

Update 9/2/24I've used these clippers now about 8 times and STILL have 75% battery life AND no loss in cutting power. AMAZING! They cut REALLY good. The T - cutters aren't all that but you can use them on your beard or a general hairline shape up. Still worth every penny. I get compliments all the time - where so I go to get my hair cut etc lol. GET THESE!!Original post below:I had purchased cordless Trimmers before, about 3 years ago, and was NOT impressed whatsoever and send one back and threw the other away.  Because of my experience and the vendor, I wasn't going to purchase these.I have a pair of clippers now which are Andis Fade Masters and an economical Wahl that I've owned the or at least 15+ years and I love them. The Andis, while nice, had an aluminum case and they get very hot if you use them and the Wahls are decent, the guards are sloppy in their attachment to the clippers and slip off and not as much cutter power or,imo, a clean cutting clipper but served the purpose.I've been cutting my hair for well over 32 years and I am VERY good at it. I got tired of getting the Andis blade either sharpened or replaced a lot also - guards werent the great - it was how they attached - didn't stay on and poorly designed imo but a well cutting clipper with powerI hadn't cut my hair since 2013 and it was plenty long and thick. I always got my hair cornrow braided by excellent stylest but it became a chore. Pricing, finding a good one, the drive and constant increases in cost which started out around $55/$60 and now $95- $200  for 4 stitch braids and I get it done evaery 2 weeks.It took a long time to cut it down because the blades weren't that sharp and and one tall guard.I decided to order these because it had many features I liked, mainly 2 different clippers. The came in 5d at 100%. I oiled them and put them to use.I mentally questioned the battery life, and power of these clippers -  they were cheap. To my surprise they were powerful even as the battery power the down a bit, and the all the issues I had with the cordless, Wahl and Andis. To be fair, if you cut as much hair as I did over that long time period, buying new blades is good thing.Use them, LIKED them both and it came in a nice travel case, well arranged and all the goodies.I'm glad I purchased these. My hair came out GREAT and was faded effortessly.Buy the clipper oil  though it comes with some and if you are male, straight razors are a necessity.Loved using these and they are now my go-to clippers.  I hope they last more than 1 yr, and I def recommend these at this point.Great clippers for the price, detail, they look great and perform well.Glad I got these and you will be as well.Take the leap!"
"This kit does exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to do! I love the clean look, the cape that‚Äôs included and the different guards for the small trimmer. Easy to use and cordless (which is so helpful with my moving 3-year old)! It is sharp but not to the point of harming. More durable than other brands I‚Äôve tried!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



These are excellent. They are super easy to use, have plenty of guards to choose from, cut evenly, sharp and hold a good charge. My son got these to learn to start cutting hair and they were perfect for a beginner. The design is also super clean."
"These are a great purchase!! Not only do they come with the clippers, but they have a liner too?? You can‚Äôt beat that! They are heavy weight and don‚Äôt feel cheap at all! They fit great in the hand. I have been using these for around 2 weeks straight of cutting, and i‚Äôm just now having to charge them so the battery life is great! They cut really good as well. They also look amazing with the gold look!! Must get!!"
"I can't stress enough how well made the clippers are. They are smooth and cut so well. The price is great and the charge last a long time."
"The package was a day late,  but no biggie. The trimmers worked really well. Overall great quality product! The set came with everything you would need, including a little extra, like a cape to keep hair off you. I would definitely recommend buying this set, it's worth the price."
"Cut my hair long really good, and the trimmers are sharp."
"Wow - what a find - For someone with thinning hair who has opted to self maintain for years, not getting a power cord caught on cabinet knobs, and having the freedom of wireless cutting is awesome. I was impressed with the engineering of this product, the precision tooling of the blade and construction consisting of metal parts, which are usually plastic on other trimmers. Yes, because of the battery it may be slightly heavier than other corded trimmers, but it is balanced and has a great feel to use. The bonus is it just looks cool, too! Highly recommend and would purchase again."
"I've been using this for a little less than 2 months. So far, so good. The blade is sharp and cuts evenly. Easy to clean using the included brush (this particular version is not meant to be submerged in water or used in the shower). I use it mainly for beard trimming (< 3 to 4 minutes of continual operation per trim), so the battery life is not an issue for me (still using the original charge after several weeks). There is a wide selection of trimmer guides included (1/2; 1; 1-1/2; 2; 3; 4), a USB cable for charging, a brush for cleaning the blade, and and a small plastic vial of oil for the blade. Also comes with a carrying/storage case made of soft rubber. Excellent value for the price and, so far, one of the best in class."
"This was an amazing deal for an awesome item. It‚Äôs exactly as advertised. Good solid and quiet trimmer. Both trimmer and clippers are fully rechargeable thru USB. Unfortunately, it does not come with a charging block, but any 5v USB charger will work. I bought this on sale, but definitely worth the full price. Super, super quiet, any very very sharp!"
"Nice set of many bracelets for a low price. I like the colors. Note that there are no reds, oranges, yellows if you're looking for something in that color family. This set includes black, white, purples, blues. They are a little snug but not bad."
"To be honest, I was expecting for a lower quality by considering its price, but nope. Very good for daily use. Good quality of material."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I think these are so much fun! Great price for a pack of 6! Size fit me perfectly, and they look high quality. Great gift idea to give as one set on its own, or the entire set of six."
"It‚Äôs cute and served its purpose for the price"
"The bracelets are colorful but are to small for adult wrists."
"These bracelets are so great for everyday wear! I get lots of compliments on them. There colors are so pretty!"
"These are very nice looking.  I actually bought these for Toys for Tots gifts for the girls that are between 10-14 years old.  At that age they really aren't playing with dolls anymore.  So wanted to get something cute that young girls would like, and these are prefect.  I was even able to seperate them out to more than just 6 sets of gifts, and putting in little clear sealed baggies.  And they are nice enough for us older ladies as well!  I am buying some more today to make so more gifts baggies."
"The bracelets are separate pieces , so I am able to mix and match to get the desired color scheme. I am also able to take out any of the bands that are uncomfortable. I always receive many complements when I wear them."
"Great colors and can be interchanged!"
"Really pretty bracelets they match just about anything, very large variety too"
"Terrible, cheap!  I wore a set to a party and my wrist turned greenAnd the colour came off on the bracelets as well. All of the sets that are a gold colour or a shiny fake silver colour will turn your wrist green. You have to take them out and just wear the beaded ones. Most likely will end up in garbage. Waste of money"
"I bought this as a late birthday and celebration gift for myself. I had my son at 24 weeks and I really wanted the perfect piece of jewelry to wear daily with him in mind. I found this necklace and fell for it, I love the way his name looks and I love that it has our birthstone too. I've worn it everyday since receiving it and as someone who's usually very sensitive to metal I'm surprised to say this necklace has never bothered my skin and holds up well for everyday use even when I accidentally wear it in the shower. It also cleans up very well with just a little soap and water it shines beautifully. Thank you so much for making this wonderful most beautiful piece of jewelry for me, it's my very favorite necklace and jewelry piece in my collection.Update:I had a really good experience with the seller, the day I posted this review my necklace had broken out of nowhere and sort of just fell off my neck, I realized the clasp had broken so I messaged the seller to see if I could receive a replacement and they happily did so. My only complaint is that it's not quite as pretty as the first one the text isn't quite as big so it's harder to read and the peridot charm is a bit dull compared to the original but I'm still very grateful and I love my new necklace I'm still sad my old one broke but I'm so happy with the way the seller handled the issue. I'll continue to come back for pieces from this seller! (New necklace pictures are the ones with blue shirt)"
"Very nice, high quality necklace"
"Love this! I bought three more! so cute and simple perfect gift for loved ones! Give time because it does take some time to get so don’t expect to have it in a day or two but so worth it!"
"I bought this personally engraved necklace for my 18 year old granddaughter's birthday and she loves it.  The necklace is dainty and well made.  Buy it!!!"
"I love it, just purchased 5 more for friends. Shipped faster then expected. I know everyone will like theirs too. Very dainty and nice chain, I wasn't allergic to the chain."
"I feel like this is something important to know prior to ordering because now my name looks like a thing or saying versus addressing a person"
"This is a really pretty high polish necklace with lots of sparkle. March stone color is perfect (aquamarine). Presentation box is very nice with Mignon & Mignon engraving. As other reviewers have noted, the sizes of stone and coin are petite. While dimensions are accurately included on the listing, posted images vary in their depiction of the actual product. Some do not show true (petite) size. Buyers should rely on the quoted dimensions. Customer service was fantastic in responding to my issue with size and sent me a replacement. I compliment them for above-and-beyond service. Kudos to Mignon&Mignon for making customer satisfaction their #1 priority."
"This product is dirt cheap, and I was not expecting the quality to be this good. It gets worn in water without being dried off, it gets worn everyday, etc, and it is still holding up like its brand new. Super cute, cross is a little smaller than expected though. Extremely light, to the point where it feels like you aren't wearing anything. Super easy to put on and take off, and the gold colour compliments any outfit."
"I wear this necklace all day every day. I don‚Äôt take it off. I‚Äôve worn this necklace for 3 weeks straight now, and I am SO HAPPY that I found it. My old cross necklace broke, and for like 6 months I‚Äôve been searching the internet for a new one that won‚Äôt tarnish (since I wear mine 24/7). I randomly came across this necklace while clothes shopping on Amazon and it‚Äôs probably the best purchase I‚Äôve made on Amazon in a very very long time. The quality is amazing, the sparkle is great, the chain doesn‚Äôt get caught in my hair like other ones were doing, and the cherry on top is it does not tarnish. Also, it‚Äôs the perfect length. I have a slightly bigger neck than most and it still hangs to the perfect length. It‚Äôs still the beautiful color it was when I got it and my neck doesn‚Äôt turn black and blue from cheap gold. And the value for your money is insane. GET THIS NECKLACE!! You won‚Äôt regret it."
"It is an awesome necklace it doesn‚Äôt fade and I wear it all the time I never take it off and all the diamonds are still in place and it comes in a cute little bag for storage I love it I definitely recommend purchasing this it is small but perfect it doesn‚Äôt dangle to low or get tangled and is very light weight and it is a lovely gold color I love itüòç"
"The cross is shiny but the chain is a bit too long for me but still really cute necklace"
"I just got my PAVOI CZ cross necklace! It looks elegant. The cross is small but dainty, just the way I like it, any bigger will be showy. The adjustable clasp is OK to handle but will be easier if  made a little bigger.  Well, I got the VERMEIL version so hope it will last for quite a while."
"It is so sparkly and cute. It is easy to put on and has the perfect length for me."
"It's cute and quality seems ok. It was a good value for the price and something my 13 year old is happy with. As of right now, it hasn't turned her skin green or tarnished. It has also held up. She seems pleased. It's sparkly...I think she wishes the chain was a tad longer."
"This necklace is cute and perfect for my daughter. It has a nice sparkle to it and the chain seems like a perfect length."
"Really beautiful necklace, I never take it off it‚Äôs been 2 weeks and it hasn‚Äôt changed colour so far I keep it in the shower. For the price you can‚Äôt go wrong, and you can adjust the chain for any length. I love it"
"I broke my necklace and was looking for a temporary necklace until l got another one at Christmas. Received the necklace not expecting it to be good ,but to my delight  it is really beautiful, it looks much better than in the picture, looks expensive and the diamonds look real very sparkly,and is not flimsy ,the price was very resonable So l won't be replacing this necklace"
"very good quality, the chain feels expensive almost and the gem is very cute"
"I was going to upload a photo but it doesn‚Äôt show it‚Äôs shine and beauty, Pictures do no justice! Very beautiful necklace very satisfied with this purchase. Looks real and expensive. I just received it so I can‚Äôt say how long it‚Äôll last so I will update on that.Update: I did find the same necklace on SHEIN for $1.43"
"This is my favorite necklace, it is simple but very pretty. So far the metal has not tarnished at all? which I impressed by because of the cheap price."
"The necklace is the perfect length and dainty. The only problem I had was the knot in the chain. I wore it anyways and it was fine. I'm hoping I can get the knot out. I thought the gemstone color and chain were pretty."
"love this necklace. super cute and good quality so far"
"I got this for my sister for her birthday gift and might I just say, I should have gotten myself one too üò≠. It is so pretty and I got it on a sale so now I really wish I had gotten one. It isn‚Äôt too long or short, and she loves her birth stone so much so I know she will probably never take it off! You won‚Äôt regret getting it for you or a loved one. Doesn‚Äôt look cheap or anything. Looks like it‚Äôs real gold 100%!"
"This is a beautiful necklace, and it is comfortable to wear. I have received many compliments.  I only wear the necklace when I am going out somewhere and then I take it off.  It still looks brand new.  I bought the necklace because it looked so good on my daughter, who wore her necklace everyday and didn't take it off, even in the shower.  After about two months, the necklace tarnished.  I predicted the necklace would tarnish, but she stated the reviews were good.  So be aware if you plan on wearing this necklace everyday, it will probably tarnish.  If you are only going to wear it and then take it off, you will be happy with your purchase."
"So cute and looks expensive, I wear it around the clock and doesn‚Äôt tarnish"
"Very pretty pearl necklace! Just the right size pearls, noticeable but not too large. Looks very pretty with a v-neck or open collar top. I’m a small boned older woman and this necklace was just the right amount of bling, very classy!"
"Very cute necklace set(1 individual necklaces) for a a gift"
"They started to tarnish after just a few wears so bare that in mind when buying"
"These two necklaces look so good. I already wore them several times and they don’t change color, very durable. Incredible value."
"The necklace I ordered was nicer than I imagined  I love it. Will reorder more la necklaces soon"
"I was very disappointed in the quality. Looks and feels like Shein (cheap) products. Could have gotten it at Shein for $1. Won't make that mistake again."
"This is a cute set. I can wear it casually or dress up."
"Very poor qualityy"
"Looks like the photo. Beautiful sterling for a very reasonable price. It‚Äôs delicate but still has definition and craftwork. Did not come boxed. Strong lobster clasp."
"I‚Äôve worn this bracelet every day,  all day for the last month, except during an X-ray, I‚Äôve not removed it.  I don‚Äôt always have the best luck with inexpensive jewelry.  No discoloration. As shiny as the day it arrived.  This bracelet has accompanied me to the gym, sauna, shower and bed.  I‚Äôve not removed it to clean my home‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs an incredible bargain with a rich look and feel.  Plus‚Ä¶ it looks as good as the day it arrived.  No discoloration.  It was a perfect addition to my everyday wear, it‚Äôs light weight, and looks  like a fine piece of jewelry!  Very pleased.  I‚Äôd be happy to receive it as a gift, and would purchase again."
"Length was perfect and the bracelet was very shiny. I love the width and that it was slightly flat. Very nice lobster claw clasp makes me feel that the bracelet is secure."
"This bracelet is simple and rather light weight.  The silver tone is whitish rather than a high reflective silver tone surface.  It will be fine for my infrequent use."
"I love this bracelet. It's great for dressy occasions as well as every day wear. Well-made and seems quite durable as well."
"It was beautiful, well made , and looked more expensive than it was would recommend it for the Christmas holidays coming up‚Ä¶!!!"
"Looks nice. Giving as a gift."
"I love this bracelet and the price is right but I have to keep replacing it because it always breaks"
"Bought for a relative who loved the look of it. They were very pleased at the craftsmanship. Clasp seems very sturdy, though it may be a challenge to open it one handed as the clasp mechanism is on the tight side. Has a brilliant shine. I am thanked often for gifting it by my relative :)"
"This bracelet is very sweet and pretty a bit narrower than I would have liked but I didn‚Äôt see a wider one."
"I wear it every day I would recommend it to anyone"
"Some of the best grade silver ever worn."
"I purchased a pair of daisy earrings and wanted a matching necklace. This necklace is perfect, great value for the money, durable, dainty and very feminine. It compliments any outfit. It is a gold chain with pearl like daisy petals."
"This is a Christmas gift for a 9 year old who is very fashion conscious.  It is lovely- delicate looking and feminine- yet appears to be of good quality.  I think she is going to LOVE it!"
"I had very low hopes, with how low the price was. I was very mistaken. I have had this necklace for a month now and no tarnish no breaking. Very nice and simple to go with everything."
"Although this necklace was quite beautiful and unique as well as sturdy chain...the pearls were damaged when I wore it for 2 days in a little water.  They appear to gave a layer of pearlized paint on them that was turning pink from my outfit and peeling off. I had to throw it out bc I couldn't salvage it....Update: They are sending me another and want to make it right. They are very attentive and helpful with customer care."
"Lovely design but the materials are terrible. The gold finish turns brown quickly. Latch failed. Had to throw it away after just a couple wears. Would love to buy a real gold form of this design."
"Delicate & beautiful necklace. Comfortable to wear."
"Just what I wanted and it looks great!"
"This necklace and earrings are delicate and dainty perfect for my 97-year-old mother who absolutely loves them!!!"
"I am very pleased with this necklace.  Very complimentary to my gold necklace I wear.  I wear it like a loose choker.  I have received so many compliments on it.  Very good value!"
"Nice n light necklace"
"This is my second time buying this bracelet. The first time lasted five years through heavy wear, including traveling and overnight use. It’s a great piece for every day wear - not too fancy but just enough to dress up any outfit. Cute even at the gym. Buy it on sale and have a great piece for many years!"
"Impressed with the quality for the price. Looks very nice for the price. The crystal stones look good. If you’re looking for a tennis bracelet under $100 hard to imagine a better deal than this."
"It so sparkly! I know my granddaughter will love it!"
"I bought this braclet as a birthday gift for my sister. She said it beautiful. She likes the way it sparkles when the light shine on it. She said she loves it."
"I bought the blue one but I got an orange one. My wife loves it but blue one looks better"
"Stunning sparkles I got compliments on the time and love the touch of the Swarovski crystals at the very bottom of the tassels and absolutely love the comfort of the bubble settings and worth every penny absolutely love it can't go wrong with Swarovski and purchased the double strand bracelet for my future daughter-in-law and I'm getting ready to purchase another bracelet for myself in silver or white gold I haven't decided but once again it's Swarovski and absolutely gorgeous zero complaints and all of my crystals are intact and are absolutely gorgeous"
"I bought this as a gift for my sister. The product is beautiful, and the extra links came in handy to adjust the length appropriately."
"I love the color and the ball clasp."
"Easy to size and looks beautiful. Bought it for my wife and she really likes it. Well made and will last for a long time."
"I’ve bought it for my granddaughters 18th and isn’t till Christmas so I’m hoping that it will fit as it looks on the small side but it looks like good quality one"
"The quality of this bracelet is unbelievable!! It’s gorgeous and fits great; easy to put on by myself. It was delivered on time when it was expected. The price was excellent. I would definitely recommend this product!"
"I was surprised by the quality of this bracelet, very nice."
"Purchased because the reviews were good but still did not expect much . It arrived and it is beautiful not too shiny or dull. It looks much more high end than the price would suggest. I am buying additional ones for my sisters."
"This bracelet when stretched out is 7 inches, but let the ends go and it shrinks back to less than 6 inches.  It is pretty tho."
"I like the fit, looks and it is NOT the real yellow gold that looks fake."
"I never write reviews on Amazon, but felt the need to do so for this product. Worth every dollar. I shower with it every day and no, it is has not changed color. It's so comfortable you can't even feel it on your arm. I received a lot of compliments on it. Amazing quality."
"This bracelet is so cute, I got so so many compliments on it while I had it on. It's a bit more yellow gold than I was expecting but it grew on me. I'm not a huge jewelry person but i want to wear more, just dont want to break the bank so this was a perfect first bracelet purchase to get going on a wrist stack.  I iked it so much, I repurchased another with no problem after my first one was damaged:My first one lasted me about a month before I had to remove it. I'll admit it's my fault for wearing it while moving into my new house which involved carrying lots of heavy, wooden furniturem however I dont think a quality piece of jewelry wouldve been ruined this easy. After a day of manual labor, the bracelet's chain link had little pieces of the links that were ripped out and would stick out, puncture my wrist, scratch me and get caught on my clothes and rip out threads."
"Great item! No tarnish, light weight, and pretty! I wear this all day everyday, even in the shower. I forget I’m wearing this bracelet because it is very light weight. Recommended. I love it!"
"I like this item  . Comfortable."
"It was lovely but way to small.  Had to return it"
"Really lovely bracelet not lost it’s colour great value for money"
"Perfect size for me and a pleasure to wear. I bought a pair."

"I love! I wear it almost everyday. I had it for about a year or two now still hasn’t tarnished, just like new. Seller is also really sweet."
"I was very impressed with the quality of this necklace for the price such a beautiful necklace and it arrived early"
"i wear necklaces with dedication AKA i never take them off 😂😂 but so far it’s still shiny. unfortunately though with thin writing in jewelry the quality is a little cheap and it will bend so wear with caution. other than that it’s been wonderful"
"I wish the clasp links were a bit larger. So tiny? Would be easier to attach if links a bit larger"
"I got this for my friend who had a new baby very early and her daughter is stuck in the NICU for months. Shes absolutely in love with it. She said she cried when she got it. It’s the perfect gift. I got 18 inches and she said it’s a great size. I ended up ordering another one for my sister who just had a new baby too! Who dosent want to carry their cute babies name around! Material, and fit looks beautiful! Reasonable price too! Perfect perfect gift! Also shipping did not take too long!"
"I'll be sure to take a photo and add it in the future.I wanted a Script Name necklace with a certain scale (Small/Medium, not ""Too Large"" in my mind). This was perfect. And yes, I wanted it in ""Gold.""The fit, font, and scale have all be exactly what I wanted. I wanted it close to my color bone but not a choker. This is mildly adjustable, so that's a nice feature.I've had other ""Gold"" necklaces which were very pretty, and the ""Gold"" was all washed off in a matter of months. It's been around 6 months of wearing it at least a few times a week. And so far, it has lasted and still looks great!I am very happy with it and will use it again in the future for Gift Giving to women on my Team for Recognition gifts!Definitely recommend!"
"Love it. Readable. Good quality. Shiny. No skin irritation. Easy to use. Weight is good."
"This necklace is very dainty and pretty"
"I purchased this as a gift for my 17 year old sister and she LOVED it. I saw it for the first time on my 15 year old daughters Amazon Christmas wish list. Now that I've seen it in person I'll be ordering one for my daughter as well. It's dainty, long and the color is so pretty. Love Kendra Scott. My daughter owns about 5 of these brands and they are all very pretty, durable, and affordable. I think it makes the perfect gift for a teenage girl."
"This was a gift for a teen. She loved it. Good quality, fit nicely, and good value."
"The photos of what I ordered had more of a dusty pink color for the stone whereas the necklace I received is bright white. It’s still a pretty necklace though"
"Kendra Scott jewelry is just  gorgeous . I have a couple pieces and having a hard time picking out my next piece because I want them all."
"I recently purchased the Kendra Scott Nola Pendant Necklace as a gift for my daughter-in-law, and I couldn't be more pleased with the result! This necklace is a stunning, dainty piece of jewelry that is perfect for adding a touch of elegance to any outfit.The design is unique and timeless, with a delicate pendant that catches the light beautifully. It’s versatile enough to wear every day, but it also has enough charm to make a statement for special occasions. The quality is excellent, with the craftsmanship clearly reflecting the brand's reputation for fine jewelry.My daughter-in-law absolutely loved it! She was so excited to receive such a thoughtful and stylish gift, and it suited her perfectly. It’s the kind of piece that can be worn with anything from casual to more formal attire, making it a great addition to any jewelry collection.Overall, I highly recommend the Kendra Scott Nola Pendant Necklace. Whether as a gift or for yourself, it's a beautiful, dainty, and unique piece of jewelry that is sure to impress!"
"Upon opening the box I just lit up!!! It is so pretty. It’s the perfect size for me. Swarovski makes this bracelet in this smaller petite size as well as a larger bolder statement bracelet. This size looks like real diamonds at a glancing distance. It is sparkly and eye catching without being gaudy. My wrist measures 5.5” so this fits nice without the extra extender on. Mine did come with a box as well. It feels expensive and solid. I am very happy with it. My review is solely based on my first impression right out of the box. I will update if any issues arise."
"It looks according to its picture it is shiny and brilliant"
"My bracelet broke the week of my daughter's wedding. leaving me no time to fix it. We purchased this one and it held up through all the festivities and parties and is still going strong after being worn multiple times. It's gorgeous, stays shiny, and the clasp is strong. Thank You Swarvosky!"
"It’s beautiful and I received a lot of compliments."
"The bracelet broke in less than 6 months. This is when I wore it only occasionally. Bad quality and will never buy again."
"I would call this a peacemaker!"
"This beautiful bracelet is made by Swarovski. Swarovski sterling silver with small crystals. Elegant yet durable and easy on and off. You can buy the matching necklace and earrings separately.  Made very well, definitely giftable."
"Great product, we bought as a gift for someone and they absolutely love it."
"This helps me keep track of jewelry I wear daily but also it is easy to fill for traveling. Beautiful case and it is very sturdy and not easily crushed."
"I needed a travel jewelry box because my mom passed away and I traveled out of state in a hurry not knowing that would happen.I needed something to keep her jewelry I wanted, and keep it safe traveling back home. It was perfect and came quick for the time frame I needed it. It came in both our favorite color and everything I saved fit perfect for travel."
"Great value and came as described.  It is a perfect size for travel.  Well made!"
"Great for travel. Fits in a purse if needed. Secure closure and nice quality."
"I have the purple one, so my daughter wanted one of her own. Both of the colors are true to the photos, which is nice. It’s the perfect little size if you don’t have a ton of jewelry. I use mine for a charm bracelet and a few long / chunky necklaces and it surprisingly fits a lot of things. My daughter is able to put her dainty little necklaces in the pocket, hanging from the little hooks.It comes with a nice scent packet too, which was a lovely bonus. It feels very elegant to have it tucked away with my jewelry, and to smell it every time I unzip this little box.Such a joy to use this every day!"
"I love mine i have two and they are amazing for any travel and have a good amount of storage, they are durable, and a good price."
"I really like this case! I've ordered even cheaper ones before from other sites, but you can definitely tell that they are CHEAP. These ones feel much sturdier and I feel that my jewelry is safe!"
"It’s a nice size and I like that it’s hard sided to protect the jewelry!"
"Loved and is made good. Perfect friend gift."
"Very sleek and durable for the price!"
"I LOVE THIS NECKLACE! It looks great on! The necklace is the perfect size, value and is well made.I think it will last a long time!!"
"Bought for myself, ended up gifting it to my niece! Then bought another for a friend! Very durable and true to size. Great value for the money. Beautiful shine and tarnish resistant!"
"I received this necklace, and felt it would fit a small child better than myself. It was not 18” in length. Otherwise, the quality is wonderful!"
"This is a Christmas gift for a work party for a female. It's very delicate looking and printing is small."
"This product was a gift for my mom.  I like the fact that it's not bulky or heavy like others I've seen, however it's chain is very delicate so you will need to be careful as to not snag it on clothing"
"Great buy, and it came faster than anticipated! Very satisfied!"
"Awesome necklace. I wear it all the time"
"I have a small wrist and this bracelet is fitted without using the extension it comes with. Good quality, very shiny."
"The sparkle from this bracelet is incredible.  It’s absolutely beautiful and exceeded my expectations.  Very happy with my purchase."
"I really like this bracelet. It is so pretty and looks very expensive. I am so glad I bought it."
"So happy with purchase!! I have a small wrist and I like it that I was able to adjust it easily with hustle. Really sparkly and beautiful ❤️"
"So beautiful and fits my wrist perfectly"
"Saw this in silver at Dillards, but wanted gold tone"
"Very pretty and shimmery bracelet. Came with an extender piece if needed for a looser fit. Love it."
"I love it and looks expensive"
"I actually treated myself to this piece.  I love Swarovski jewelry.  Good quality for the price.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  It is simple and very elegant.  Highly recommend.  Great for gifting."
"Beautiful! Everything I anticipated. Loved the clasp on the back also. Perfect"
"I love wearing simple necklaces but can’t stand when they turn constantly and you can see the link. I love that this one keeps the gem in place and doesn’t move. Super cute!"
"25 year old male got this for my 20 year old female girlfriend for Christmas.Comes in an okay bag. Did come tangled from Amazon but untangled easy and was able to set it up for a nice gift display.Chain is a little fragile But 4 months and it’s held up fine. Size is a little small but all in all gal was happy"
"This is a beautiful pendant, well presented which is perfect for a gift. Very shiny as you would expect Swarovski to be."
"This is the perfect size. High quality. Great purchase"
"My mom loved the necklace"
"This necklace is beautiful but unfortinuately, too short. An extension would grately be appreciated."
"Lovely chain, bought it to go with a charm I purchased separately. Comes in a lovely gift box perfect for xmas"
"Fettero is a brand that’s new to me. However, the two pieces of jewelry I have from them are STUNNING. (I have this particular necklace in blue and green—I am absolutely obsessed with both.)The value of this piece is absolutely there. The price is so affordable and the quality is great. It’s durable, stylish and eyecatching, rests at just the right length, is adjustable, and is gorgeously crafted. I can’t say anything about whether or not it is tarnish resistant but I will say I have been wearing them frequently for months and both pieces still look brand new."
"This season I decided to add a couple of small necklaces which are very much in style, but are very highly priced in actual 14K gold. This lovely necklace is small but definitely visible in a quiet, classy way. It's perfect for business or more dressy wear. The chain is well made and the clasp easy to use. The color looks ""real"" and blends well for layering with other necklaces if you like...perhaps a simple coordinating gold chain. I have worn this a number of times and received compliments and ""Where did you find this!?"" comments from co-workers and friends. There is no sign of tarnish nor the dreaded *green skin* : ) At this economical price and excellent quality, this is definitely a keeper!"
"I absolutely LOVE this necklace. The chain and pendant feel like nice solid quality. The pendant is dainty. The gold is shiny. It's perfect. It looks like a much pricier necklace than it is (which is a hard thing to come by these days)."
"It's bigger than I expected and the color is ok for me"
"Very nice quality 👌"
"The pendant is extremely well made and very pretty. The chain,although very nice, should be thinner. You can't remove the pendant from the chain as the bale is smaller than the clasp or the little diamond dangle. But the quality and presentation is excellent."
"Very pretty!! Matches my birthstone."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



These are beautiful, although I thought I was getting at least a 1.5ct pair at the time.After wearing these for a while, I love the screw back, they are secure and can be worn in the shower and while sleeping without causing me any discomfort.The pair I got came with a certificate of I1 and above with unknown color rating, so for comparison, I have a D color rating .25 ct, VVS1+, flawless ring for comparison, for the price the earrings are really clean and sparkly. My pair was 5mm and 5.1mm so slightly above 1ct total."
"I just received these earrings today and am thrilled with them.  They are beautiful.  Just what I wanted.  The screw-on backs are great too.  Well worth the price!  They look like I spent twice or three times as much money."
"Pleasantly surprised that these are larger than I expect and have a beautiful sparkle. Downside: it took two weeks to ship but luckily I ordered early!"
"Although sold as 1/3 of a carat- it's the smallest 1/3 of a carat I've ever seen. The diamonds are just to small for the price. If the quality is good; it's hard to tell because they are to small to even see. The screw backs are not easily attachable which makes me think the posts are not properly scored.  I'm going to return these since they were a gift I simply can't give!"
"Earrings look fine not quite as good as a pair I purchased at a fine jewelry store was hard to get. Thought it first with the screw on backs, but once I got them on, they are very secure and can leave them on I was. skeptical that I did not get any. certificate with the earrings. I never did get them checked out by a jeweler. I’m just gonna trust. They are real diamonds and keep them. for the size of the diamond and the price I paid I’m going to keep them as it’s a fair price."
"I bought mine to wear 24/7 in my pierced ears since the openings were almost closed from disuse. Very comfortable and attractive although small (which is what I wanted so they didn’t poke me when sleeping). I have a terrible nickel allergy but had absolutely no reaction to wearing them."
"The original price is a ridiculous inflated price that does not reflect a remotely competitive price, in order to make the 50% off price attention getting.  Compared to the general market for this size, color, and quality, the 50% off price is okay - not a great deal. I wanted screw back so they are very secure, which they have and are good."
"I was worried about the brightness and color, but I was not disappointed.  Studs are a nice size and I really like the screw backs"
"They were a bit smaller than I had envisioned. The diamonds are 'pretty' brilliant. Not 'really' brilliant, but for the price they are good value."
"Gorgeous.  I like the screw back too, they feel very secure."
"Got these for a significant other and she totally loves them. I am pleased. The backing clamp is white gold too and the screw gives you peace of mind. Additionally, you get a certificate on a card telling what you actually own. Which is a good touch. We road tripped all of california. She wore them a lot and they stood up to the rigours.Overall, we are very happy to discover this product, is a lovely pair. I have asked my girl to get them out for the lads.She got them out for the lads. Everyone was commenting on how nice they are.Great set. So pleased I went with amazon."
"love my bracelet. It looks great and good quality ."
"Great value. Beautiful elegant bracelet at a low cost. I get compliments on it all the time."
"I had gotten this bracelet as a gift to my niece along with a beautiful guess watch in gold from Amazon and the combo together looks very classy! The bracelet is a gem all on its own! Very happy and beautiful piece!"
"Beautiful & it fit ! Great gift for her ü´∂üèº"
"This bracelet is very beautiful, it is the perfect piece to wear often. Easy to clasp on and off and very practical price for such a gorgeous piece of jewelry."
"The bracelet is pretty but the clasp is easy to come undone. Wear with caution."
"Everything was ok. Thanks"
"Love this bracelet!  Had one previously and they have vastly improved the clasp!"
"I love pavoi jewelry. I almost solely wear huggie earrings and everything I have from the brand is amazing, great quality, and the price is right. I’ve been wanting a tennis bracelet, but didn’t want to shell out the big bucks. This looks fantastic! So sparkly and very comfortable. I have larger wrists and purchase the 7.5."
"I've purchased several pieces of jewlery from pavoi in the past and they've all held up well. I wear my jewlery 24/7 so far this bracelet is holding up just as well as my other purchases, it hasnt tatnished at all. The bracelet is super sparkly, so gorgeous. It's actually quite lightweight and very comfortable to wear. The clasp is a bit tight but I'd rather it too tight than loose. Gorgeous tennis bracelet for an amazing price. I will definitely be purchasing another one"
"Love the way this bracelet looks with my stack, super shiny! I had a similar one from target that tarnished super quickly, but i’ve been wearing this in the shower and have swam in it and it still looks super great! I never take my jewelry off and this has not tarnished i’m super impressed. Always swear by pavoi jewelry :)"
"Bought this as a gift. Comes in a small green box that says PAVOI in gold letters. Bracelet is in a small pouch inside the box. Wish it came on a velvet bed instead. The bracelet is gift ready.The bracelet is very pretty and shiny. It looks great for formal and casual wear. It’s definitely a step up from simple bracelets. It’s also got a premium feel to it.Overall, worth the money. It’s a nice piece of jewelry. You don’t have to spend much for good pieces and thankfully this is a good example.I rarely buy jewelry and I’m pleased with this purchase. I am not sponsored at all and rarely write reviews."
"After reading so many positive reviews I decided to get this bracelet. It’s so pretty and sparkles as if it were diamonds. The only thing I did notice was the clasp is a little hard to open/close. I would definitely order again in the silver. Over all I’m super happy with this bracelet!"
"it was absolutely lovely. I had one previous to this, not same company and the clasp broke so I needed another one."
"This is a beautiful bracelet that I have gotten so many comments on-I do wear it everyday and after two weeks-still looks as good as the first day I put it on! I have the yellow gold and it complements the sparkly cubic zirconia stones perfectly. Seems sturdy enough and for the price, if it did break, I would certainly replace!"

"Context - purchase for 10 day vacation. Wore nonstop all 10 days, but avoided showers, and water or soap in general. Did not baby it however. Eg it got knocked around pretty bad. Since then have worn it for again on and off for about 1 month.Pros -Sturdy - bracelet never fell off. Stones are all still there. Clasp is really strong* con on this laterSparkly - very sparkly. Decent sized stones too. Looks real almost. I have noticed slight dulling over the course of the 1.5 months.Wear / tarnish - the outside still looks really good. *the inside where it touches your skin has tarnished and is revealing a bronze color. I don’t mind since you can’t see it.Does not turn skin green or at least not meDidn’t really catch on my clothes so the prongs seem to be well made.Cons- it’s hard to put on and take off. The clasp is SO hard to pry open especially if you have fake nails be careful of chipping a nail- again it does tarnish. Don’t expose it to water, lotion, soap, etc.Overall, highly recommend. Maybe more for short term use due to the tarnishing and dulling OR for special one off occasions. It’s really pretty in person and reliable."
"Fits my wrist like a glove (6.5inch) and is good quality I shower with it and never take it off. Kt is very shiny and looks really nice and good quality."
"This compact and enjoyable speaker offers a range of features at a very reasonable price. It comes with Bluetooth connectivity and some unique features like covers for the ports to protect the unit when outdoors. The device feels sturdy and appears to be designed to withstand rough handling, making it suitable for outdoor use. I appreciate the USB power option, which eliminates the need for inconvenient connectors and mini-USB cables. The speaker delivers clear and well-balanced sound with a good range that travels effectively. It also provides excellent battery life, which is a hallmark of Sony products. Overall, I highly recommend this speaker."
"I use this to connect to my TV when I want sound up close to me that does not bother others in the house...it works great for that.  It's very compact and does not take up much space.  It connects easily to my Samsung TV.  Sound quality for that use is excellent.  And while I'm sure it would do well on a patio or in a room playing music where the environment is not too noisy, this is not going to boom sound at higher volumes like Sony's or others' larger speakers.  If you want that kind of volume, this is not the ""droid you are looking for.""  Battery life is very good...I haven't run it to when it ""dies,"" but I do typically run it for 10-12 hours without recharging.Well made - I've dropped it several times and no damage.Sony quality in a small package!"
"Very robustly built and gets pretty loud. Though I wish it did get a little louder, and the bass is pretty muddy"
"I was having problems synching my old Amazon Tap, so I replaced it with this Sony speaker.Bluetooth synch was instantaneous and the sound quality and volume range are excellent.I use it while in the shower, and it comes with a wrist strap that you can use to easily affix it to a towel bar or whatever.  This is an EXCELLENT product."
"I have had a few months time enough to evaluate this speaker or should I say speakers; I purchased two of them for the ability to have stereo. I got them to replace my failed JBL Flip 5 Waterproof speaker. I could have just purchased the latest JBL Flip 6 but decided to try the Sony’s instead. In comparison I would say the bass and battery life were better on the JBL 5. But the Sony’s have grown on me. They do have great sound and good bass as well as hearing beautiful separated stereo. The battery life is about 6 hours and not 12 has they claim. Although they do charge up very quickly. Setting up bluetooth connections was tricky making them sync for stereo. An easier way to connect is using the free Sony App “Music Center” which connects them with ease. Once connected, they can be used with any other App on your phone. One troubling thing was carrying them as a pair. There is no linkage to hold them together and there is no Sony case designed to hold them as a pair. After full research on this I found that the dimensions of the JBL 5 resembled a similar shape and size as a pair. I purchased one of the “Lebakort Hard Case Compatible with JBL Flip 5” (slender but longer for accessories with a carrying handle) and also bought a Hermitshell Hard Travel Case Fits JBL Flip 5” (shorter but fatter for accessories with a secure loop and Carabiner). Both cases are a perfect, comfortable fit including the charging cables. I highly recommend these little speakers as a Stereo pair combined with a storage case. Love them very much and I’m sure you will too."
"TLDR: It's a fantastic little speaker for the price! Perfect if your laptop or phone speaker just isn't cutting it.Long Version:I needed something for listening to music or watching youtube videos as I'm cooking or cleaning. My phone and laptop just can barely keep up as I move around cooking or cleaning a few feet away. This speaker is great for filling the house with volume!While I try not to push speakers and amps much past 50% volume, to avoid overwhelming or over heating them. The volume of the Sony XB13 remains gentle and quiet until you get to 50% volume. Then it scales up rapidly just like you see in the Rting review. At first, I thought it was extremely quiet compared to the JBL Go 3.It was only after writing my first review, I decided to investigate the Rting's spec sheets. I couldn't understand that the Sony was within 1 DB of peak loudness with the Go 3 when it felt a quarter as loud. After pushing it to pushing it to 70-80% volume, I discovered that the loudness scales up exponentially to it's peak. It filled the entire house with sound at 70%, just as I had hoped for.This design of exponentially increasing volume is actually brilliant, because you can finely set the volume when you need it to be quiet. Then you can still get it loud and clear when you need it as well! Quite brilliant in my opinion. It really took me a while to appreciate this thing, now I love it!It's a fantastic little speaker if you can get one on sale for around $40! Almost unbeatable in this price range when you consider the price of buying speakers with an amp."
"Sound boost for watching movies, etc. on the phone is only OK. I have the sound all the way up, but it's still not quite loud enough to hear if some other noise occurs or when stepping into the next room. Not worth the cost."
"I've had one of these for a while, and nobody can believe such big sound comes from this little speaker. As an audio nerd I was intrigued by the stereo pair feature, so when Amazon had it on sale I bought another one. It's night and day. Good sound in mono becomes great sound in stereo. Unfortunately the barely-there instructions aren't very clear about how to set up the stereo pair - I wasn't sure if you needed to pair both speakers to your sound source, or just one. The answer is, just one. The second speaker pairs to the first speaker. So far, the speakers ""remember"" that they're paired, so when I turn them on, they are still paired. They let you know it, too: a voice comes out of one and says ""left"" and then you hear ""right"" from the other one. If you have one of these speakers already, buy a second one, you'll be glad you did."
"I have owned quite a few speakers in my time, from small to large, wireless and powered. This one stands out for its richness in volume, loud enough for an outdoor environment and small enough to carry anywhere. Connection to my Samsung phone no issues, no loss in connection, smooth play. Good speaker for the money."
"Small, tastefully designed, easily removable strap so I can have it on my desk. I was hesitant about black, but it looks sharp and good quality. Sound quality is great. Overall super happy! I tried some obscure brands before getting this one but they had issues with bluetooth connectivity, and frankly looked not that great, finally decided to go back to sony, I’m happy I did. Quality is quality!"
"Love the size good wee sound u can take it out the backdoor and holiday, 😍"
"The JBL Boombox 2 has truly impressed me in every way! Right out of the box, it was so easy to set up and start using—Bluetooth pairing is a breeze, and the controls are intuitive. Whether I’m indoors or outdoors, this speaker delivers incredible sound quality. It fills the house with deep bass and crisp highs, making everything from music to podcasts sound amazing.Durability is where this speaker really shines. I’ve strapped it to the back of my quad for rides, and it’s even taken a few falls with no issues at all—it still works perfectly! It’s built like a tank, yet it still looks sleek and modern. I love the design; it’s bold and stylish, so it fits in anywhere, whether in my living room or out in the yard.As for power, this thing is a beast. The sound doesn’t just fill a room—it dominates it. Outdoors, the sound can be a little softer in wide-open spaces, but it still packs a punch and bumps hard. The battery life is fantastic, giving me hours of non-stop playtime without needing to charge. It’s my go-to for any outdoor activity or gathering.In short, the JBL Boombox 2 is incredibly easy to use, sounds amazing, and is tough enough to handle anything I throw at it. It looks great, sounds even better, and keeps going strong no matter where I take it. Highly recommend!This version emphasizes ease of use, sound quality, durability, power, and appearance, giving the review a well-rounded feel."
"This speaker is a MUST for audiophiles.The high, mid and bass are perfectly balanced for premium sound.  The battery life is great.  The carrying handle mashed it nice to take anywhere.  It looks sharp and sleek.  I've spent a lot of time listening to music and this is the best speaker I've ever heard"
"Absolutely love this speaker. Quality sound, easy to use, and long battery life. Music is my world and this speaker makes it so much better! I would not hesitate to recommend it 😊"
"I never expect the size that way. So big. My 3rd time ordering on this JBL bluetooth speaker. Easy connect from the device to the speaker. Fabulous sound quality. Thank you for this!"
"I purchased this a while back and forgot to review but the wife loves it and still uses it. She’s taken it to the beach and it lasted for hours on one single charge. Haven’t test the waterproof claim but I’m sure it is since my buddy has one before me and he said it fell in his pool no issues. The sound it great and can get pretty loud."
"Awesome sound and deep bass, value for money"
"We got lucky with the price for this amazing JBL boombox aswome quality in every way sound everything it is just amazing, easy to conect, long battery life.  100 of 100 for this product"
"When I first took it out the box I tried to connect and use the speaker but it was cutting in and out and the bluetooth range was almost nonexistent. I looked online and followed the 10 step guideline listed on the job website and now everything is working perfectly! I will update if anything changes!Review:This thing might be big but it’s only because it packs a huge punch. It has clear, booming audio while still being light enough to carry. The design makes it super portable without sacrificing looks. It charges a bit slow but it also has a great battery life so it’s a trade off!Overall 9/10!"
"I purchased two of these to link. Frankly, I advise just purchasing one because the sound on one is better than the split equalized sound on the pair. Love this speaker."
"Great speaker plays nice and clear and loud"

I was waiting for it to go on sale so I can buy it and there was a previous deal at $58 but I didn't bite and knew it'd go much lower on black Friday Month and I was correct. I snagged this little glowing gem at $49. Such a great deal. I bought it because I walk in the daytime and I like listening to music but my phone wasn't loud enough so I thought of buying a small compact but loud with great sounding speaker and I've found it. It's loud has great sound, very sturdy and durable. Works great so far. Design is awesome. I can put it in my pocket and doesn't bother me. The clip itself is very durable and such a convenient thing to have. It also has an app to customize to customize the sound! I'm just so happy with it so far. Those were all of my PROS for it.The only con this thing has is the battery life. It says 12 hrs of battery life but it only lasts about 5hrs and that's probably because I always listen to my music on Max volume which would make sense. But the battery life doesn't bother me because I only use it for about an hour and then charge it once I'm finished listening to my music. I doubt people would listen to music for about 5hrs anyway so it shouldn't bother you. Great buy, make sure to buy it when it goes on sale. I am not a fake review, not whatever. To prove to you that I am not fake, my favorite anime is One Piece and Go watch DanDaDan Rn it is PEAK. DanDaDan is slowly becoming my favorite anime already ü§£"
"Great little speaker for a reasonable price. Love the ease of use, small size, clip/ handle so I can attach it to a bag, and sound. It is cute! Long lasting power as well. Nice selection of different colors to choose from. Recommended!"
"This is a great portable Bluetooth speaker.  It produces great sound with no distortion, even at high volume levels.  The battery lasts throughout my eight-hour shift with no noticeable loss of power.  In addition to great sound the clip defines a new level of convenience allowing me to clip it to my belt where it is safe and always travels with me. I appreciate the large, easy to use on/off and volume controls.  One thing to note is that this is a monaural speaker and lacks the spatial quality of stereo sound.  I don‚Äôt really notice because I use it at work where it is noisy but it is noticeable when played in a quiet environment."
"My daughter loves this speaker, she clips in on her bike handles for music during long family bike rides, her sports bags to bring music to warm-ups and other places. Great sound, perfect size. The color is pretty and it‚Äôs easy to sync with phones. Works well! Nice quality speaker and parts. Worth the price!"
"Not as heavy as expected, easy setup,  and incredible sound quality including options for 3 types of sound styles.  Long battery life and fast charging.  Great buy!"
"In my opinion, this speaker is one of the best bangs for your buck. It's very loud for its size, the battery  lasts a while, and it can just clip anywhere.I use mine in the shower, it's literally perfect for that.  I don't even care about the lack of an aux port because this speaker is so small and portable.I got an Xtreme 3, and it sounds so much better than the clip 5, however it is far far less portable (also the speakers just have different features)I'm gonna leave you with a little caveat: It's a mono speaker most of your music is actually going to sound worse. It'll still sound ""good"", but it can sound better if you think about adding a second one for stereo sound, or just jumping all the way from the clip to the Xtreme series, because the clip through the charge are all mono speakers. the Xtreme is a stereo speaker.Just be noted, if those are features that matter."
"I love the aesthetics, the form factor, the size, the color, the volume and last but not least the clip. With being said I was less than enamored with the most important feature of this speaker which is the sound. It‚Äôs a smidge too bright and shrill for my taste. Luckily though there‚Äôs custom eq in the JBL app. So not only was I able to tame the sounds I didn‚Äôt like but I was also able to eq more of the sound I do like which is warmth. Now the sound is smidge better than adequate, and that‚Äôs all I can hope for. Keep in mind though that when you go above 60 percent volume the bass starts to decrease, and at 80 and above it virtually disappears. Luckily 60/70 is loud enough for me and that I normally play it in its sweet spot which is 40 percent.Do recommend this speaker? Yes. Just have realistic expectations. Which kinda seems like a big ask these days lol"
"The JBL Clip 5 is a fantastic find! I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. The sound is impressively clear and powerful for such a compact size. The built-in carabiner clip is super convenient for taking it anywhere. The build quality is excellent‚Äîit feels durable and well-made."
"Sound is good for its size"
"I purchased this speaker because it touts multiple features that I really like and was at a price point that is significantly lower than the ""big brands.""  This is a capable speaker that is relatively easy to pair to your Bluetooth device (phone, tablet, etc).  It's not too heavy, is quite water resistant and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy a party or family outing on the deck.  At just under $40, the sound quality (overall) is difficult to beat.  The bass is pretty deep and rich, the higher frequency sounds are very clear and not hindered by the closed-mesh grill that aids in making it waterproof.  I like that it's USB-C charging enabled and the SD-card slot is great for when you are out of ""cell range"" and just want to play music.Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks that could be addressed in the next revision.1 - The volume is directly tied to your Bluetooth device.  There seems to be almost NO amplification offered.  I am very hard of hearing and even at max volume (or when I'm in the pool and this is on the deck), from greater than 8 feet away, the speaker leaves MUCH to be desired in volume.  When I'm enjoying an evening on the deck or in the pool, I want my music to enhance the activities.2 - The buttons on the top are for ""play, power, mode, and volume adjustment"".  For a remote speaker that is designed to keep one from having to handle (even in wet conditions) their mobile device, I would expect to have buttons to switch to the next song or even go back one selection (or more).  If that feature is there, then I haven't discovered it.3 - The protective ""door"" on the charging port/PC port/SD card slot leaves much to be desired.  It's rubberized to help with the waterproofing, but the actual size/diameter of the rubber extension from  the cover to the speaker is so small, I imagine that after a few uses in the hot summer sun, it will become brittle and break.  Full disclosure, I haven't experienced that with this speaker (it's still new), but I have with others.  We boat a lot in the summer, so this could become a problem in the near future.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and hope to enjoy it for a long time to come.  My biggest complaint of all the items above is the volume.  The speaker is simply TOO QUIET!  In your bedroom, office or library it will be ""ok"".  Unfortunately, if you go outside (on a boat, pool deck, back porch) or anywhere with a high ceiling, you won't be “Waking up the neighbors”.  The MFG says the battery life is up to 24hrs, based on how high you have the volume, with 6 hours of playtime at max volume.  I have been fortunate to exceed that and would, therefore be willing to give up a couple hours (or connect it to a power pack) if it meant I could take it on the boat and be able to hear it blasting out those summer sounds."

This review is for the Vanzon V40 Bluetooth speaker. I included a video that shows the version of Vanzon speaker I'm reviewing because most of the reviews I am seeing are for a different version that looks rectangular not triangular in shape. Besides being different in shape, this speaker has lights on the 2 ends that cycle through different colors at 2 different speeds or can be turned off if desired. I am unsure why there are 2 different speakers on this review site. I'm guessing that this triangular V40 is a newer version? I actually also have the rectangular model which I like and still use but I think the triangular V40 has a better and more modern style and also  has slightly better sound quality.This speaker has great sound quality for a small speaker. The high tones are clear and the bass was surprisingly good. It connected quickly via Bluetooth to my phone and I can listen to my music and phone calls with the speaker. I really like the waterproof feature because I listen to music in the shower and the speaker is not damaged when it gets wet.The speaker has a long battery life which the manual says is 20 hours. The speaker automatically shuts off after 20 minutes if you are no longer playing music. This is a nice feature because it helps conserve battery life in case you forget to turn it off.  The speaker recharges rapidly using a USB-C type cable.  One comes with the speaker in case you don't have one. A 3.5 mm audio jack cable is also included if you want to connect the speaker with a wired non-Bluetooth device.This is an amazingly good Bluetooth speaker especially at its very reasonable price. I highly recommend it!"
"Wanted a second speaker to listen to audiobooks while sewing in an upstairs room. The Vanzon set-up is pretty easy, it discovers bluetooth devices with just a short delay, then emits a tone so you know it's connected. I can set up my audio book in the kitchen and carry the speaker upstairs and it doesn't disconnect or get distorted. Nice size. Good sound quality without distortion at the loudest setting. Seems to stay charged pretty well, although drains faster if using bluetooth at a distance for a long time. It was priced competitively compared to other similar speakers. It can be linked to another speaker but I haven't tried this. Comes with a type-C charging cable.Negatives: Not as loud as my old speaker, so it does not work well with my loud sewing machine unless I have it positioned right next to me. There is no visual display of the mode in which it is operating. the charging is included, but is a type c. As I have all android devices, not apple, this is the only type c device I own so when it needs to be charged I have to figure out where I left the cable or just keep it connected to the speaker at all times."
"These are fun little speakers that you can take anywhere without worry. They are waterproof so theres no fear taking it to the pool or the beach. The RGB lights are a nice touch, it adds a nice atmosphere to the room when music is playing. The speakers claim 20 hour batter and contains 24W bass. There are physical buttons on the speaker that can be used to control the music. I am enjoying it so far."
"It’s portable, and the battery is last long times. It won’t take too long for charging. That’s most that I like. They have very nice volume. Easy to operate and connect easily  with my iPhone. I pick pink color which is my fav color and I love the pink, very beautiful!"
"Very good sound for the size of the speaker. Offers better indoor sound, but also good for outdoors. Bought it because of its waterproof capabilities, but I don’t want to test that for now. :-)!will be buying a second one to test the wireless pairing with additional speakers."
"Just got it while I was working out and swapped my old speaker with this one.  Works great. Sound quality is good."
"I have at the speaker for about 18 months. Sound is good but only getting about four hours of use per charge."
"Thank you quick delivery great product"
"Nice speakers. This thing is loud. Great to take with you to the beach. Easily connects to your devices too."
"Nice speaker. Has good sound clarity.."
"This bluetooth speaker is compact and has good sound quality. It is also waterproof. I am going to use it to go to the beach in the summer and not have to worry about sand/water. It also has an SD card slot and takes up to 64 GB cards. It says that you can connect two of these to make a better stereo experience. I might have to get another one and try that out. Battery life is good. I have had it playing for 8 hours a day for the past few days and it hasn't had to be charged yet. The only downside is the LED flashing lighting mode isn't maintained after you power it off. You have to change the LED setting each time you power it on. Not a major issue though."
"I bought this speaker as a travel speaker. I'm more than happy with it's performance.  The battery life is great, lasts a long time. The volume and sound quality is very good.  Lastly, it travels well..Fits easily in my fully packed backpack. Most importantly it pairs easily"
"I purchased this little Bluetooth speaker to connect to my Peloton bike, which has very poor internal speakers. It does the job really well. It would be perfect if it had an auto-shutoff feature, as I sometimes forget to turn it off when my workout is done, and the battery runs down in the ensuing hours (sometimes issuing a low power beep that wakes me up at night). Overall a really nice product for the money."
"5 stars for the time being.  Good sound, low price, good for music in the barn.  No need for radio reception, no need for wall power.  It's plenty loud.  A 32G SD card will hold more songs or audio books, etc.) than you need.  Unfortunately the instructions are unclear and incomplete.  Here is how to play from an SD card.First, the card has to be populated outside the speaker.  The card is not recognized as a device when in the speaker using a USB cable to the computer.Start with the speaker off.Insert a micro SD card with your songs in mp3 or wav format on it.  The manual says it will take up to a 64GB card.  I used a 32GB.Turn the speaker on by pressing the on/off button slightly more than 2 seconds and release.Wait till LED is steady, and you hear one sound and then shortly another sound.Press ""play"" button for 2 seconds and release.Now press ""on/off"" button and release. (This is the trick)Music should start playing.Use ""play"" button to pause or start play""+"" does both volume up and skip track forward.  Press/ release to increase volume.  Hold ""+"" long until it skips to  and starts playing the next file.""-"" does both volume down and skip track back.  Press/ release to increase volume.  Hold ""-"" long until it skips to and starts playing previous file.The speaker will play continuously, rolling back to the beginning and starting over, until you stop it.This works better than a radio for me, with the bonus of no commercials, and only what I want to hear."
"Love this lil speaker! I take it to the river with me, practically, every weekend. It's small, which is convenient to put in my backpack. The battery life lasts FOREVER! I have been at the river for 6 hours and the speaker lasted the entire time. And the volume is decent. That is the only thing, i feel, could be improved. But for the price, you can't beat it. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for something compact, easily portable, lasts for hours and has a decent volume level."
"I work in a dirty, dusty environment so, my good speakers are not coming to work!!! I usually had another brand that was my ""go to"" work speaker & I would get about 1.5 years out of each one...that's operating 50-60 hours a week in a hot, dirty, dusty fiberglass composites shop, being exposed to misuse & abuse such as blowing it out with 120psi compressed air, and occasional drops & bangs that I do not recommend others expose their purchases to!!! Truthfully, it's absolutely cruel & unusual punishment for a speaker, so getting 1.5 years out of a ""cheap"" speaker is great!!In all honesty, my shop speaker usually lives the life of a destructive test subject!!!Now on to this speaker...Great sound, actually better than the other brand I used to use!!! It connects easily & I'm sorry I can't rate the battery life, but it's almost always plugged in during use...pretty sure the longest I've ever used it unplugged would be 2-3 hours, so have never ran it to that limit. Sounds great & is audible over several industrial machines in the immediate vicinity, I don't expect ""audiophile, symphony quality"" audio from this unit...and, honestly if you do, you're probably one of the reasons the desiccant bags in shoe boxes say ""Do not eat"". But...it has taken all of my abhorrent abuses in stride & come out grinning...at least for the first month. I will definitely update this review when/if the speaker finally succumbs to the reaper!!! But for this first review, I am very pleased with the unit & believe it's going to last at least as long as my other ones were & at a lower price point!!!"
"Didn't work with with my Guitar! Lol! Worked with smart phone and with a voice recorder. Good bluetooth range. Decent volume, size and quality!"
"This is the third one i bought in a row, the first one I lost at the beach, I loved the product so much i bought it again, my mom liked it a lot so I give her my second one and I bought a third one for myself. It lasts really long and it is really loud for the size. I use it in the shower all the time and it hasn‚Äôt caused any problems for all the three speakers I‚Äôve bought. It charges pretty fast, but I wish the battery was longer. It only needs charging like once a week if you really use it."
"Don‚Äôt pass on this little gem because of its ridiculous low price !  Sound quality is very good (surprising bass) and you can crank it up !! Connects quickly every time to my phone.  You will be surprised at the sound quality!"
"I am giving this sound bar 5 stars, but with reservations. It is compact and not overly large. It fits on my mantle under the mounted tv. This is the second sound bar sent to me. The first one only worked a few days before I had to call Sony and troubleshoot it to find out it was defective. The price was good, however I had to pay UPS to return it to Amazon. I was told I would recoup the loss but as of yesterday that credit had not shown up in my account. First: pros- sleek, lightweight, good sound, good pricing, several ways to connect, seamless hookup with remotes, TVs, streaming devices, good sound. - Cons: I turn my tv off at night and then when I want to watch again, the sound bar won’t work. I am forever having to unplug the bar, tv, and fire stick to have any audio. This does not make sense. There is notations of the bar going into mute when you turn the device off, and it depending on what configuration you start up again, ie: tv first, sound bar first, streaming device, etc., it can go into mute mode. This is ridiculous. You want, or at least I do, one remote for everything so you don’t have to keep up with remotes for each device. I have a Sharp, interactive smart tv, and use a fire stick for my “cable”. I have no choice as I use the “gig” internet and that provider for my cable channels. My provider encourages you to use your own devices to receive the channels they offer so for us it’s the fire stick for cable and streaming. This should not be the problem with the bar not connecting and/or going into mute mode because of you turning your tv on. Since the description of this sound bar uses the seamless hookup as one of the advantages of purchasing this product, the manufacturer should design it to come on and work, regardless of what sequence your remote turns all the devices on. Amazon replaced the first unit (had it about two weeks, one using it, one trying to figure out what was wrong). Sony was good at troubleshooting but was no help at replacing the unit, even with me supplying the invoice, etc. After the troubleshooting, and me providing the invoice by email, I never heard from Sony again, so any compliment I give for customer service is to Amazon, which had me a new one ASAP. I might note that this didn’t start happening until this week. We have had the replacement only about two weeks now, so this occurrence may possibly be another defective unit. I bought a protection plan because of the reviews about this product. I maybe should have just bought another product than this one. Independent analysis of sound bars at the time I purchased the first one had this one as #1. I will update later if I continue to have to reboot everything to get it to work. I forgot to mention I am using the HDMI-ARC hookup which is the one suggested. Update: I think I found the answer on Sony’s website. Using an option on the remote - ie:voice - turns the HDMI-ARC option off. Since that is my connection method unconsciously I have been muting for restarting my connection, when trying to set the bar for better voice, less background. This bar does have good sound, very decent wattage and a reasonable price. I will stick with - now - 5 stars."
"This soundbar is a great quality soundbar for the price.If your like me, and have kids, animals, and other environmental noises, your TV's audio is lacking (like my TCL TV), or your simply hard of hearing (i have all 3 issues!).. this soundbar is perfect!It has several different sound modes, so you can switch between various modes depending upon if you want a ""home cinema"" feel for loud action movies, want the sound of the voices to stand out during long dialogs that would usually be hard to hear due to background sounds/music in the show/movie, or want to have a better gaming/music experience.. this soundbar has a mode for your needs.It's simple to set up (plug and play), simple to pair to for Bluetooth, and has a clean/sleek design for mounting and/or placing in your entertainment center.Overall, it's a solid 5 star for me based on price vs quality"
"The Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar is a solid choice for enhancing sound in a smaller space, like a home office. Its compact design makes it easy to fit just about anywhere, and the setup was super simple—took me just a few minutes to get it connected via Bluetooth.The sound quality is impressive for such a small unit, with clear vocals and balanced sound. The bass reflex speaker adds some depth to the audio, though it’s not quite as punchy as larger soundbars. But for casual music, video calls, or even watching shows in a smaller room, it works great!The build quality feels solid, and I appreciate the integrated tweeter for a cleaner listening experience. Overall, it's a great option for anyone looking for a budget-friendly, compact soundbar with decent performance.I knocked off one star just because the bass might not be enough for those who want a more powerful sound or the voice setting. But for my home office, it does the job."
"Sony sound systems are typically durable and high quality but I was skeptical given the price of this one.I was surprised how good the sound quality is. I have the sound bar connected via Bluetooth and it works great!It looks great, is durable and light weight. I guess the only negative (if I had to pick one) is that the top volume is not too loud so if you have a big loud room, it might not be loud enough."
"Purchased this to overcome problem with Toshiba TV speakers distorting on deep base sounds.  Easy to set up by placing on shelf below TV mounted on wall.  Used the HDMI-to-HDMI Arc port on TV so soundbar on/off and volume are controlled through TV, eliminating need for included remote.  Tested on same streaming series where deep bass was causing problems with TV speakers. It definitely passed the test.The only issue is a lag time of response when powering TV on or off, and same lag time when adjusting volume.  This is a minor nuisance because the sound is incredible, and the price is great."
"Sony soundbar!! It’s gonna be great as compared to all the non name brand ones available here on Amazon right?  Unfortunately not so much. It’s a good, clear , slightly “tinny “ sounding soundbar. It’s hooked up to my bedroom TV . I’m glad I didn’t buy it to hookup to my main TV. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a decent soundbar, and it is probably better than 70% of the non name brand soundbars here on Amazon but it’s not awe inspiring and it has a few features that chap my butt and almost made me return it. It has three led lights across the middle of it. They OFTEN (7 out of ten) don’t turn off when I turn the TV off. It usually takes two or three attempts to turn the TV on and off to get them to turn off completely.  The volume goes up in increments of two rather than increments of single digits. Alright Mr. Smartguy, I know that it doesn’t matter what the number is and if zero is zero and the first time you press up to increase the volume the number is two rather than one who cares. While I agree with that way of thinking… it still just kinda ticks me off. Anyway… that’s my two cents."
"I can’t be sure why there’s any negative reviews here.For us, this is a Godsend. We have a higher end Sony Bravia 42” LED flatscreen TVs purchased in 2010. From day one we used this TV permanently connected to an ex excellent audio system, bypassing it’s internal speakers. We have now purchased a 65” Sony Bravia to replace that set and moved the old one to the bedroom. There, we began to use for the first time with it’s internal speakers, and we’re very disappointed with their sound quality. (But we are used to the very best sound). That TV has rear firing speakers and this was no doubt a concern to our neighbour on the other side of our townhomes shared wall. This Sony sound bar has made a huge difference to the sound quality. It’s front firing, aside from a single rear port for bass reinforcement. This port can be padded down with a foam plug (not included) if desired to reduce its effect on neighbours. It beats the TV’s internal speakers hands down x10. But .... It’s ideally suited to bedroom use. It is NOT a replacement for a dedicated audio system of good quality. It will play loud if desired, but critically to us it plays super clear at low volumes.I suspect that many negative reviews here are from people with unreasonable expectations. It’s NOT a boo box, and frankly a device of this size will never produce earth shaking bass. Physics dictate that. Importantly is does not EXAGGERATE bass. As for connectivity using Bluetooth, and sound quality using music devices, I cannot say. We bought it sold for television use. I wouldn’t expect this to provide HiFi quality music reproduction. It’s pricier than many of the Asian designed and built ones, but well worth it. It’s a real bargain compared to many of the higher priced brand name ones that are 2 and 3 times the cost."
"Service was excellent, only hiccup need a international conversion power point."
"I bought this soundbar to improve on the quality of sound I got from my TV speakers. It is a significant improvement for general TV viewing. If you are looking for a high quality sound experience for movies etc., you will probably need to spend considerably more. It was a good value for my purposes."
"Great sound, multiple methods of set up, easy to pair via Bluetooth, incredible price!"
"The speaker is fairly small and very lightweight. It is easily portable so I don‚Äôt mind moving it from my laptop to tv as needed. It came boxed with an attached dual usb and aux cord and a small instruction sheet.On my laptop I simply plugged the speaker‚Äôs usb cord into a port and the speaker powered on. I then plugged the aux end of the cord into the aux outlet on my laptop, selected a YouTube video and was all set to go. The knob in the front, center of the speaker controls volume. Turned completely counterclockwise there is no volume audible from the speaker. Turning it clockwise increases the volume. That‚Äôs it. One control. Very clean design. At first I turned the speaker to max volume and the sound wasn‚Äôt much louder than my laptop typically sounds when the volume is set high. I then increased the volume setting on my laptop which had been set pretty low and the sound from the speaker was much more amplified as I was expecting.Pleased with the results from my laptop, I moved the speaker to my Samsung tv. I plugged the usb and aux ends of the speaker‚Äôs cord into the appropriate ports on the tv. I turned on Netflix, clicked on the ‚ÄúWe are the World‚Äù (USA for Africa) documentary and was ready to enjoy the voices of a bunch of awesome 80‚Äôs singers‚Ä¶Tina, Michael, Kenny, Huey, Bruce, Lionel, Cindy and so many more. The speaker has a very clear sound considering its very affordable price point. I will continue to make use of it for online meetings on my laptop and entertainment on my tv."
"Sound from my TV was lacking, so I decided to purchase this soundbar. Highly recommend! Sound provides a lot of clarity and is easy to hear. Easy to set up as well. Very satisfied with it."
"Nice little sound bar. I love that it can be separated into 2 speakers. I am using them at my desk for my laptop when it is locked. Great quality and value."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



This was very easy to install, just plug in and pick connection option. I used the HDMI cord, powered it on, selected HDMI on the remote and it began playing. The sound is good, a nice boost to a living room."
"I got this speaker to use at my desk for my computer. It did not disappoint! it is compact enough that it doesn't take up a ton of space, however it provides more than enough sound with pretty good quality for anything I am doing. It is simple and easy to use and works for what I need it to!"
"Plugged this in as soon as it arrived. Easy set up, just a couple of minutes to identify the right connections. Sound is impressive for such a compact speaker. Television audio was much improved so foreign language accents are much easier to understand.  And the price certainly makes this speaker a bargain. I knocked off one star because my TV hangs on the wall and I wanted to attach the speaker to the bottom, but that was impossible because the speaker case is not set up for that."
"This is a perfect mini soundbar for my application.  I needed an external speaker for the little TV in my RV and this is a great improvement over the TV's built-in speaker.  The construction of the speaker seems to be high quality.  The sound quality is awesome and the installation via cables is quick and easy.  I have also used this speaker with my laptop while traveling and it works flawlessly.  At this price point I am very happy with my purchase."
"I will not bore you with pictures of the same sound bar everyone else has. Instead, I will discuss the performance of the bar. I purchased at the same time I purchased my current 55"" Amazon Fire TV. The bar has performed flawlessly. I do not see this as a ""basic"" bar as others have put it. Sounds like all bars are basic now from what I am reading.Never had any compatibility issues between the TV and the sound bar. Installation was very simple and my TV remote controls the bar simultaneously for volume controls, which is perfect. Please note, I have my bar connected wirelessly. Pairing the device to my TV took less than a minute. Sound quality and responsiveness of the bar was never affected by wireless connection.Bar is excellent with music output. I use the TV for Sirius XM radio throughout the day, and definitely during the night to help me sleep. Bass could be slightly better but sound range overall is great. It does not appear this bar is compatible with any external subwoofers. The bar is lightweight, portable, easy to move, and does great for movies, tv shows and music. Definitely intend to hold onto this one."
"The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar is a fantastic addition to any home entertainment setup. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its sleek design and solid build quality. The setup was incredibly easy and straightforward, even for someone not particularly tech-savvy. Just plug it in, and it’s ready to go. The integration with my Fire TV was seamless, and the soundbar instantly recognized the TV, allowing me to control everything with one remote, which is a huge convenience.In terms of performance, the sound quality is excellent. The 2.0 speaker system delivers clear, crisp audio with rich bass that enhances the overall viewing experience. The inclusion of DTS Virtualand Dolby Audio provides a surround sound-like experience, making movies and TV shows more immersive. I also appreciate the Bluetooth connectivity, which allows me to stream music from my phone with ease. Whether I’m watching a movie, playing games, or listening to music, the soundbar performs brilliantly across the board.Another standout feature is its compatibility with smart TVs, making it a versatile addition to any home entertainment setup. The soundbar is also compact and doesn’t take up much space, which is perfect for those with limited room.Overall, the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar is a fantastic product that delivers on all fronts—ease of use, sound quality, and versatility. It’s a great value for the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their home audio experience."
"I bought this speaker to connect to my TCL Fire TV.  Setup was straightforward.  I connected the speaker to the HDMI eARC/ARC port and it was automatically detected by the TV, so there was no need to go into Settings and make any changes.  Plus my TV remote adjusted the volume so I don't need to use two remotes.  There was a noticeable, tangible improvement is sound over the TV speaker, no doubt about that.  It's not a high-end speaker so I tempered my expectations but it is definitely good value for money.  No complaints there.  The only drawback is that there is a lag when the volume is adjusted and it is a bit off-putting but I can live with it.  Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this speaker."
"If you're looking to improve the sound for your TV but don't want to spend a lot of money, this soundbar does the job. It's not in Bose soundbar league, but it's not meant to be either.Simple to setup. Supports HDMI eARC, optical, USB and Bluetooth inputs. Produces decent sound and certainly much better than what any TV factory speakers can do."
"Amazon Fire TV Soundbar, 2.0 speaker. Works with Dolby Audio NOT DD+ or DTS.  DTS Virtual:X does not use dts codec, it is just enabled on the soundbar like a virtual 3d sound widening eq setting. Through Dolby Digital codec with volume at halfway vocals are clear and it sound pretty nice compared to TV speakers, but at lower volumes clarity is lost. Trying to use both tv speakers and sound bar leads to audio sync issues that your tv options may fix, but probably not 100%. I ended up using an optical audio cable instead of the HDMI, saving me an HDMI port and keeping my CEC capable streaming device ""FireTvStickMax"" in control of my tv.  Sooo, I Must use 2 or 3 remotes instead 1 or 2, fire tv remote, soundbar remote and tv remote if I need to change tv settings... I still don't know which of the tv's digital audio output sounds better, Dolby Digital or PCM?  Soundbar lights up green with DD, that makes me feel it could be more surround, but PCM seems 2x louder, lowering the volume they sound the same to me, think more clarity with pcm, but does PCM from tv make it stereo out to soundbar? IDK but I think so, you would think as long as the source is surround/DD then the tv pcm out should contain multi-channel audio.  I chose DD at around half volume, I can see 2 lights on the soundbar at half volume... and hopefully its more surround sound capable. I probably should have spent this $ on a real surround sound system, but this has a nice size footprint so it's not in the way and movies are more enjoyable now."
"I bought this for my class. A RV works wonderful because the TVs that come with the camper the volumes are very loud and when you’re running your generator, it’s kind of hard to hear it a little bit but when I bought the sound bar because I can’t hear very well This is actually fantastic. I’m gonna buy one for my house too now worth the money. Very easy to hook up to your TV comes with instructions I would recommend"
"Plug in the HDMI and power cables into the back of the bar, place it close to your tv (mine’s a Fire tv) then plug the HDMI into the back of the tv and the power into the plug then just turn on the tv!  That was it!  My Fire tv remote controls the power and volume.  Easy Peazy!  The tv sounds fine without it for me but the soundbar makes it sound even better!"
"This soundbar offers excellent value for its price. The materials and build quality are solid, and the connectivity is straightforward. The volume control on the front works effectively, and it’s surprisingly loud given its compact size. If you're looking for an affordable speaker for everyday tasks, this is a great option.Best For:- YouTube- Podcasts- Conference calls (speaker only)- Similar activitiesNot Recommended For:- Music- Movies- Immersive gamingWhile this speaker is decent overall, the primary factor in my rating is audio quality, as it is, after all, a speaker.  The sound is clear and loud, making it suitable for filling a room or listening to spoken content.  However, when it comes to enjoying a movie, music, or immersive gaming, you’ll notice it lacks depth in both the upper and lower ranges.  I own several speakers across various price points, and while I’d use this one for meetings, YouTube, or podcasts, it doesn’t deliver the rich audio experience you might want for other activities."
"Easy set-up, great sound, multiple connections--great and easy sound in an attractive case!!"
"The sound quality is quite good. Speakers work great. Sound separated well. It was easy to set up. Seems well built."
"We like the sound of this sound bar. It’s better than the TV sound alone. We may get one for the TV in the bedroom. Easy to set up."
"Easy setup, good size. 10/10Sound Quality 5/10, you get what you paid for.It's not something I would get for myself.Check other brands."
"The sound quality is superb. Left and right speakers work great. Almost like surround sound. It was very easy to set up. Hopefully it will last for a long time."
"At low volumes it is not that great. It goes in and out with volume pitches. But at high volumes it sounds great"
"It was very easy to wall mount these speakers as they are light weight. Multiple connection options is convenient for connecting multiple devices. When you want to play music from your phone all you need is to do is to switch the device. The remote looks and feels cheap, but it gets the job done. The color perfectly blends with the TV."
"I bought this when I upgraded to bigger smart tv.  The sound quality is excellent.  Before this product I had to turn on subtitles when I watched movies on Tv as the sound quality was not good.  But with this product the sound is so clear and crisp I don’t need to turn on sound titles.  Also very good to hear music.The only problem I have with Sonos is their app which is horrible."
"This is my 3rd Beam Gen 2 soundbar each now connected to Samsung flat screen tv's.  In order to setup I called Samsung customer service who took the time to help me thru getting my Samsung tv to recognize the new Sonos Beam soundbar along with the tv remote. I had downloaded to my iPhone the Sonos app but for those who are new to Sonos you will need to download the app. The app is the bridge to hearing  the sound from the Samsung tv coming thru the Beam Gen 2 soundbar.  The Sonos is where the soundbar is registered, recognized, and completes the connection to hear the sound coming out of the soundbar. Just as a side note, the Sonos Beam Gen 2 does not come with a remote but does have a short length audio wire should it be needed, I did not have need of.  I do recommend as a gift to yourself or for a person who would appreciate having a quality soundbar.  If possible purchase on sale."
"Solid design.  Doesn’t take a lot of room.  Sounds much bigger than it looks.  From my research getting the mini subwoofer will take this little guy to another level.  I’m going to be purchasing it soon"
"This product relies completely on an app you must load. There is no remote, nor is there any real way to control it without first connecting to an app. My phone was able to find the device, but then it required connection to a wifi signal. That is where the wheels came off. Apparently it can only connect to a 2.4GHz signal. My typical signal is 5Ghz. I did turn on a 2.4 just so I could connect but it still would not in the app. My network showed the device, but the app kept failing. No app, no functionality. calling support landed me a 35min wait and online help showed basically there is nothing you can do. So this item is immediately being returned.I can't stress enough how stupid this design is. If you have a product that relies 100% on the app, then the app better work. I will never waste time with a sonos system again. If I could give this zero stars, I would. I wasted two hours trying to get this to work and get someone on the phone."
"I normally don’t write reviews unless the product goes way beyond expectations. This is one truly amazing sound bar. Easy to set up and crisp sound. The sound is a bit mind blowing in the fact it produces sounds that appear to be coming from different parts of the room. Movies such as Dune sound so good it’s like watching a different movie. Games such as Halo are mesmerizing but you have to do a little setup with your Xbox…no fault of Sonos. I do not recommend the bar if you are limited to only an optical cable. To get the full benefits of the bar I strongly recommend a TV with ARC / eARC. Great for smaller rooms and 55 inch and under TV.  Bottom line this sound bar sounds better than many home theater systems."
"We bought a Beam (gen 2) soundbar and an Era 300 on sale recently.  While the instructions are clear, he This would be 5 stars except the APP is glitchy and not as intuitively user friendly ( unless you're a software engineer!).  During initial setup the AP stopped with error message ""unable to register product.""  After 3 attempts (two hours) it stayed with the message.  FORTUNATELY , we had a friend of our neighbors who worked for Sonos and he was great at walking through it - finally had to do factory reset on both units and then was able to proceed.  Did advanced tuning for each room - and the sound quality of these units is unbelievably good.  We had a small portable Bose speaker - this is a long overdue step up!  Once set up you wont regret it!  Just be patient......"
"Phenomenal sound absolutely love it"
"Tried a Bose it stopped working after a few days ,returned it and got the Sonos for my LG TV ,was advised by Bose thy have a problem connecting to LG TV's"
"I’m really impressed with the Sonos Beam Gen 2. It’s compact and fits seamlessly with my room setup without taking up much space.Setup was incredibly easy. The Sonos app guided me through every step, so I had it up and running in minutes. The sound quality is where it truly shines, though! Even without upfiring speakers, the Dolby Atmos makes it feel like sound is coming from all around, and dialogue is crystal clear. It’s perfect for movie nights.I also appreciate the connectivity options. HDMI eARC means I get the best audio quality, and it integrates effortlessly with my other Sonos speakers, so expanding my setup down the road will be a breeze. Plus, having Alexa and Google Assistant built-in adds a ton of convenience—I can control the soundbar with just my voice!Overall, the Beam Gen 2 is a fantastic addition to my home entertainment. If you’re looking for an upgrade that’s powerful but compact, I highly recommend it."
"Sound for TV and music is great, recommend adding the small sub to complete the set up. Big difference in experience watching TV Shows and Movies"
"I bought this as a quirky activity to do after work, and it’s turned out to be a great way to unwind. The theme is goofy, and I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did, but here I am, recommending it! The pieces fit really well, and the quality is top-notch—no puzzle dust, which is a huge plus for me. It’s not overly challenging, but just enough to keep me entertained while giving my brain a break. This puzzle is a keeper!"
"Working it little by little… funny fact, all the dogs are pooping and there are actually poops in the puzzle.L O L."
"This is the best funny gift for avid puzzleperson. Can hardly wait  to see them open on Chistmas!"
"This puzzle is a great way to pass time. The companies customer service is 10 stars. When we first started on it we discovered that one of the border pieces wasn’t there. I called them and without question they sent another one and we were able to complete it. It took 10 days to finish."
"Great for a white elephant gift. We couldnt stop laughing at all of the dogs"
"First and foremost, the humor in this puzzle is undeniably clever and amusing. I couldn't help but chuckle at the adorable puppies caught in the act of, well, doing their business.

"This puzzle was fun because it is very different from other puzzles. It will challenge you ,all the pieces are the same shape ,but the pieces are thick and cut perfect with no catches on them. The colors are vivid which helps with separating puzzle pieces and helps with the difficulty of putting it together."
"Bought this for my sister for Christmas. We are always plating jokes on each other. I can't wait to give it to her. I know she will love it."
"We always do a puzzle together over Christmas as a family, and this year was especially fun with this one! The quality of the puzzle was good."
"Lots of fun doing this one"
"I loved the puzzle that I bought for my son"
"Prompt, good communication, good price."
"I love the concept, but the image quality is poor. The bottom section of the puzzle is pretty clear, but the top section is fuzzy and pixelated. The pieces are quite poorly made, many of the pieces seem to be the same shape and fit into other similar pieces, the only way to double check for pieces of the same color is to flip them on the back and see if they printing on the back lines up. Way overpriced for the quality (I see a similar/same pooping dogs puzzle listed on Amazon for half the price and the print on the box looks the same), which is more reasonable considering the poor quality of the print and fit of the pieces."
"Not only is the puzzle itself beautiful but the pieces are sturdy and thick fit together easily and cleanly and have a beautiful Sheen to them. The puzzle has imprinted numerical codes on the back so you can put it together in sections if you choose. All together this was one of prettiest puzzles I have ordered and probably will hang it on the wall eventually. The stained glass effect is quite impressive. This is a great puzzle for such a low price!"
"Challenging, sturdy puzzle. Took me 6 days to complete. A relaxing project to do before bed. Comes with a poster which is helpful. Variety of colors. All the pieces were included. Cardboard is thin but sturdy- ends don‚Äôt fray and I was able to pick up the whole puzzle as you see in picture 1. Worth the money."
"I love working 1000 piece puzzles and this one was a doozie!  It does have the quadrant markings in the back of each piece, but i don't use those. The colors are beautiful and it's just hard enough to make your brain work a bit more than usual. Very pretty, high quality pieces and packaging."
"i will stick to 500 piece.  But I like the fact that they have letters on the back to help.  It‚Äôs taking me a while to put it together.  This is a beautiful puzzle."
"A good challenge, but a relaxing way to spend rainy evenings. Excellent quality."
"I loved the alphabet system on the back for each section made putting together a bit easier.  I have framed it an it is a beautiful piece over my bed.  I wish I could find more like this for the price!"
"Fun project but disappointed that 2 pieces are missing"
"The quality of the pieces is incredible. It's gorgeous!"
"Bought quite a few puzzles lately and enjoying them all. This one is quite beautiful! Not super hard, but not boringly easy either."
"It was afun puzzle to put together. No missing pieces.  This year 3 of 8 puzzles by Buffalo games has been missing pieces."
"Buffalo Games makes the best puzzles that I've ever done. They come in so many cool designs and are really sturdy. They make a huge range from very easy puzzles and very hard puzzles. Never buying puzzles from another brand again."
"It was fun to build and the scene is interesting and different. The image is very clean and the pieces fit very well and hold together. I started at the top and worked down this time. When I finished the stars, sky, trees and mountains I thought that was probably the 'hard part'. Oh no. For me the lower half of the picture was much more work. I didn't mind, but was a bit of a surprised. I thought I'd be able to knock that part off quickly. ;-)"
"Love doing this puzzle. Lots of beautiful colors"
"This was my first puzzle in decades.  It was VERY challenging because it was 1000 pieces, but it looks absolutely amazing with great colors and clarity.  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!  My wife and I look forward to doing more puzzles like this together"
"This was a beautiful puzzle! the pieces fit together great, and were of good quality, but one piece was missing completely and 3 others did not fit. They were the correct color like they should go in those places but the shape is not correct."
"Love the Gorgeous picture. So nice to put together."
"I have 5 edges pieces missing"
"This was a very enjoyable puzzle! I was able to complete it without looking at the picture because there were so many unique objects, and the pieces fit well and were not identical in shape or color. It was very satisfying to put together the pretty scene."
"This puzzle is very challenging, but I am gradually getting it done. Due to repeated shapes, some pieces will fit together where they do not belong. There is also much similarity in the colors which makes it difficult to distinguish correct placement without carefully examining the picture.  If you enjoy a challenge, this puzzle is for you.."
"This puzzle was fun to do. My wife and I put several pieces in the wrong place, and they looked correct. It wasn't until we had a couple of pieces that would not fit in the area that we were working. making us reexamine our work. We have never had a puzzle that allowed us to get so far with an incorrect piece in place. If you like a good challenge this puzzle is for you."
"10/10, gorgeous. Extremely challenging. Took us (two mid-20 year olds) two months to complete after we purchased when we got COVID. I loved the challenge lol, but I also had multiple “WHAT do you mean you DONT GO THERE?” And “how does this piece POSSIBLY fit in this puzzle?!”Highly recommend, but probably not if you want something easy. Also, can confirm it’s easily chewed up by animals… pieces still fit tho >_>"
"Was a nice jigsaw, very nice colors and good quality pieces"
"All pieces were included.  No noticeable dust.  I was very pleased with this puzzle.  I hadn't worked a puzzle in many years and enjoyed assembling this one.  It became much easier to assemble when I asked my kids for a puzzle table which they gifted to me.  Having the table made a huge difference.  The colors are vibrant just as pictured.  I took my time working this, not every day.  I simply enjoyed doing it."
"I love puzzles and they are good for seniors also. Love it doing it."
"This  puzzle delivered to me 9 Feb. is missing 1 puzzle piece and 2 pieces do not quite fit.  Disappointed to not be able to finish it."
"This was a gd puzzle although the greenery was challenging as the artist used the same colours and brush strokes in many areas.  The print was clear. Another quality Buffalo Games jigsaw."
"Puzzle difficulty. I can say 13 and up. The quality and the color palette is amazing. Unfortunately for some reason it was missing a piece"
"This was challenging puzzle and so beautiful. pieces we thin but fit together well. Would make a nice puzzle as a gift for an adult used to challenging puzzles."
"The colors are very beautiful and realistic. It’s a good family time pas time. The quality is really nice as well."
"I have done MANY puzzles but this puzzle was ABSOLUTELY the most challenging.  It drove me bunkers and I LOVE IT! lol. If you want a challenge, this is the puzzle for you!"
"My husband and I do a lot of 1000 piece puzzles and are pretty good at them. There’s a lot of texture on many pieces, this puzzle kept us busy and provided a challenge! Took way longer than most puzzles we’ve done together but was beautiful when finished."
"It was a challenge with the landscape of this scene."
"This is not a simple just put in together puzzle. There is a challenge to it together. The picture has enough elements to it so it is not crazy.  The picture is beautiful and the pieces are sturdy.  It is a great puzzle."
"Great puzzle,  difficult enough to be challenging."
"This is a beautiful puzzle. A bit difficult in some places. The pieces fit perfectly."
"Although this puzzle's picture was nice, the print was not as clear as the other Buffalo Games puzzles. It was quite grainy possibly due to the canvas lines of the image. These canvas lines are helpful if you are a first timer as they tell you which direction the piece goes. But if you are a seasoned puzzler, it spoils the enjoyment of putting the puzzle together."
"I loved doing this 1000 piece puzzle. It was challenging and passed the time away.I am a Senior and puzzles have really helped me stay busy during our Winter months."
"******UPDATE******Company sent the replacement puzzle quickly..received it in the mail yesterday. WOULD HIGHLY recommend this company. Their puzzles are fun and challenging and they take customer service seriously!!After contacting the company, they said they will send me another puzzle. I'll let you know if it arrives.Although I truly enjoyed the puzzle and the challenge it was, I was sad to find out there were 2 missing pieces at the bottom border. I was unable to do the puzzle before a lot of time passed since my purchase in August of last year, but wanted to let consumers know to know of my experience."
"We do a lot of puzzles and this was our favorite. This same picture is produced by many manufacturers. The quality of this was high with a great price/value. What made it great was it was a nice scenic picture with a variety of diverse colors and puzzle shapes. It was challenging without being boring, the perfect mix."
"I have thoroughly enjoyed putting this puzze together!! Beautiful, vibrant colors.  Just be careful because about 2-3 pieces are the exact same size and if not placed properly, you'll think that you're missing pieces and you're not. Try to locate the misplaced pieces and you'll have a perfect puzzle 😉"
"Well made and good quality pieces."
"1000 piece puzzle that takes up more than half my glass coffee table. This puzzle was difficult to put together because there were so many pieces that worked in wrong places and throws you off. I had to spend so much time redoing. It’s definitely beautiful when it all comes together though. You get what you paid for…Also the delivery guy put the puzzle in front of my garage in the dark, I ran over a corner with my car and crushed some pieces."
"Early in the game we were fully convinced that one edge piece was missing.  Like many other puzzlers before us, we looked for what felt like hours and couldn't find the last edge piece.  So I took to the reviews and we were shook.  Many other reviews claimed up to 121 pieces missing!  We were distraught.  We lacked faith and confidence that we would end up with all 1000 pieces and therefore the sweet, sweet satisfaction of the last piece locking into place to create our masterpiece.But we forged ahead and through the miracle of Christmas and Hanukkah we slid the last piece into place.  In the group was a lifelong puzzler, first timer, and others in between and we had a great time figuring out the tricky parts of the picture.All the pieces seemed sturdy and, most importantly, all the pieces in our box were present.  Maybe the fact that we weren't sure about having a complete set actually added to the suspense?? All is to say, we had a great time and I will definitely repurchase a different puzzle from Buffalo Games."
"Love it"
"Vivid colors, fun to put together . Would buy another from this artist."
"The puzzle quality is not bad, it came with a picture of the scenery. The only downside is it came with one missing piece. Otherwise, it will be a good purchase at C$15. Despite the missing piece, I still have lots of fun with it.Update: I found the missing piece, so no missing piece. (added a star)"
"Although the print was clear, the pieces didn't fit well. Some had to be pushed in causing the puzzle to bulge.  Not your usual Buffalo games quality. But the puzzle was still fun to do and the image is pretty."
"Gorgeous puzzle and great quality. Love all the puzzles by Daryll Bush."
"good quality ,great image. I have to like the image to enjoy the puzzle this fits the bill"
"If you want a tough puzzle this is it!! The odd shapes will test your patience, it took a little time but it was hard fun! The final result it beautiful"
"This is by far the most challenging puzzle I have ever done! I am attaching a picture to help anyone who sees this review to see what the pieces look like!"
"This puzzle was perfect for an evening of fun. Hubby and I put it together while watching a movie. It’s easy enough to do in one evening so no need to let it sit out collecting dust and taking up table space.The colors are bright and the print quality is really good. Such a cute picture too. It wasn’t too easy or too hard."
"Love the white & red together. So beautiful!"
"A bit more challenging than we originally expected."
"I got this as a gift for my daughter who collects gnomes."
"I ordered this puzzle because I liked the gnomes and because another reviewer said it was so difficult that they returned it. The background trees were definitely a challenge, but I finally succeeded!"
"This was an interesting and challenging puzzle to put together. Unfortunately there were a couple of pieces missing. One was an edge piece. This is the first bits and pieces we've put together. Many of the pieces had a slight curve to them that kept them from laying completely flat. I wonder if this was a return and had been rolled up in a puzzle mat at one time. I'm thinking we'll be sticking to buffalo puzzles for now."
"This one was really challenging after we finished the gnomes and rabbits.  My sister and I usually take a day to finish a 1000 piece puzzle.  ( we've been doing them for over 60 years)  This one took an extra day and half.  Lots of fun.  Really enjoyed ourselves.  Thank you..."
"If you like a challenge this puzzle is for you! Pieces are all weird shapes…taking forever to put it together"
"Maybe it’s me, but I don’t have the patience for this. After you get the gnomes finished, it’s one piece at a time. And because the pieces are such odd shapes it gets really boring really fast."
"Nice quality,  was fun to do."
"Hard puzzle to do!!!  But beautiful and fun for the family to do together!"
"This is a nice design & quality puzzle. It's great for a rainy day or just some non-electronic  time."
"If you do puzzles you know some pieces aren’t great quality and that wasn’t the case here. The pieces fit nicely together and the overall quality was great! A fun holiday puzzle for everyone to enjoy!"
"I got this for my 92-year-old sister-in-law who enjoys doing all kinds of these puzzles with her adult children.  There is always one on the table being worked on.  It was reasonably priced, cute picture, and quick delivery.  All is well."
"The style of the artist made this puzzle more difficult to assemble which is great. The only issue is that there was one piece missing. I have looked everywhere for it around the table and it was never found. It only took me mostly one evening and a little the next day. So disappointed."
"The pieces are really different than other puzzles I have done, but they are interlocking and it is a fun puzzle. My 57 year old son is enjoying it immensely."
"As other reviewers have said, this puzzle requires patience and perseverance, but is very satisfying when finished.  The ark and pond are relatively easy, but the trees and surprisingly, the animals are tough.  Many pieces have very little information as to where they might go.  It is not possible to simply sort, for example, for particular animals because the colors of the pieces are somewhat dull and many animals share colors.  The same for the trees and darker shades of the lawn.  That is not a complaint, just a hint as to what to expect once you finish the top and bottom.  Mine had all pieces and a poster, which is essential when the going gets tough."
"Between the complexity of the puzzle and the puns (indicated in the accompanying picture), this was both a challenge and a joy to work on!"
"This puzzle is very colorful and fun to build! But Buffalo games please put your puzzles in a bag."
"Hours of fun! It’s difficult but that’s what puzzles are for!"
"I bought it for my brotherHe likes the challenge with the 1000Puzzle pieces.He liked it very much."
"Can’t wait to put this one together. All of the Buffalo puzzles I’ve bought have been really nice quality. Am certain this one won’t disappoint."
"Fun challenging puzzle. Buffalo Games is always a hit in my home."
"The quality of this puzzle is a bit off:  the pieces do not seem to fit together well - even when correctly placed.  This is a challenging puzzle, and I worked hard to move it toward completion.  About 3/4 from the finish line, it became all too obvious that pieces were missing - a puzzler’s nightmare!  Other reviews have mentioned this problem.I boxed it up and returned it.Such a shame because it is an interesting and creative puzzle."
"This puzzle has to be one of the most enjoyable one I've ever done. The colours are nice, animals are cute and difficulty level isn't that high. One of the best parts is the amusing narrative that painter Eric Dowdle accompanies with the puzzle. Highly recommended. 👍👏"
"This company does crisp, clear images, so you can figure out where the piece goes, reasonably-shapes pieces - and the bears tearing into all the junk food is a hoot!  We need puzzles that are do-able, not overly tricky, to relax at the end of a brain-draining day.  This company has a series of camping scenes, I own all of them.  Nice slick surface to last, the thinness of the pieces means you'd better be careful disassembling them - the notches are the weak point.  Eventually, after several runs through (next year), I figure it will need some gluing, but -oh, the bears!!!"
"Fun puzzle to do. Colors were great, great size. Easy to see."
"Most fun to put together. We’ve put it together twice already."
"Good quality and very colorful. Pieces fit nicely together. I would but again."
"This was a fun puzzle to do.  Quality pieces, beautiful colors"
"I love puzzles and Buffalo Games are my favorite brand!  The pieces are thick and stay together.The colors are move vivid than other brands."
"Fun and great picture"
"Fresh from the box. Many of the pieces are ripped or attached/not fully cut apart."
"Great picture, and the right difficulty level for me. Enjoy putting it together!"
"One of the most difficult puzzles I've ever attempted but all pieces were present and in good shape. A few pieces were still attached to one another so that was a little disappointing but with so many pieces to work with, it didn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the activity."
"This puzzle is extremely hard, none of the pieces fit together good it took WAY too long to get even the boarder together and they look crooked when put together. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll even be able to finish it."
"I have a nervous system disorder that makes fine motor control challenging.  So, I choose puzzles that appear or are labeled difficult.  I‚Äôm always seeking a challenge to overcome this disorder.  This is by far the most difficult puzzle I‚Äôve chosen to date.  Bravo!  Sincerely."
"I REALLY wanted this puzzle to work. I couldn‚Äôt even finish the border because of missing pieces. Several pieces were torn, and none of them fit really nicely together."
"My daughter is a huge Harry Potter fan. I saw the puzzle and knew it was something she would really enjoy. I know the company reputation for high quality products. I think the puzzle is well worth the price, especially if it can give enjoyment to someone special."
"This puzzle was very average. A few pieces had cardboard coming off the back and came out of the box cracked. Also, the pieces do not fit together super well. It was just okay."
"One of the harder puzzles I ve done üëç but very fun."
"The pieces are not cut well they are all torn and don‚Äôt fit well together. I was not impressed with this puzzle at all."
"Quality of these puzzles is ASTOUNDING for the price, have that satisfying 'click and glue' from a quality puzzle, no bent pieces, no missing pieces (I will note I did go out of town and unfortunately left this puzzle on a table that my dogs had access to and I'm 99% positive they ate some of these pieces while I was away).But beautiful graphics! Put the puzzle together and could see all the details, the image wasn't smudged and the chaos provided just enough entertainment to keep me staring at the pieces and pictures (you get a smaller print and then a larger print) for hours. I will continue to buy these puzzles and as of today have bought the cat and dog one, in my cart I have 3 more in the set (rollercoaster, movie and the Candyland - absolutely worth purchasing again due to the tiger shark dogs that ate my pieces) and will be purchasing those next.Also the feel of the puzzle is just so satisfying, smooth and matte. SOOO happy I found these puzzles!"
"This is my second puzzle from this brand and in this series.  Absolutely love the picture as fun to put together.  Puzzle is more expensive than some other brands, but the pieces are a higher quality which makes putting the puzzle together a more pleasant experience."
"Love this puzzle. The pieces snap in nicely, it doesn't feel cheaply made, and best of all the matte surface makes it easy to see even under the light.It's also a very fun design, adults and kids both enjoyed it and we bought the others in the set as a result."
"This was a great puzzle to put together. I appreciate how thick and sturdy the pieces are! I had no issue with any missing pieces unlike one puzzle from a different company. I also had no issue putting the puzzle together as the smaller picture not the poster reflects the current puzzle. The picture to puzzle ratio makes this puzzle and the matte finish super cute. I’m a puzzle saver so I will save this puzzle and eventually hang it. I bought another puzzle from this same company!!"
"This was a fun puzzle to do.  I love doing puzzles with bright colors with fun scenes. This one didn’t disappoint.Pieces are a great quality and fit together nicely.  There were no peeling pieces, which is a pet peeve of mine.  The colors in the puzzle are nice and bright.Great quality puzzle for a great price!"
"Love this puzzle!  Pieces fit together nicely: they have a really nice look and feel. There is no glare on the pieces so easy to work on the puzzle at night or when lighting is not the best.I have bought a lot of puzzles and this is one of my favorites."
"Our family loved this puzzle while on vacation!  Great illustrations and fun to work on it.  Adults and 12 YO."
"Loved the quality of the pieces!  Totally worth the extra cost -  you get total satisfaction from the accurate fit between pieces.  One thing that really threw me was that the large poster picture of the puzzle doesn't match the puzzle.  I'm not talking color tone is off, but actual people are on the puzzle (e.g., jumping in the lake) that aren't in the actual puzzle.  Also, some of the colors are completely different (e.g., a running kid in the poster had green pants and white t-shirt, and in the puzzle the pants were gray and the shirt was green).  I kept looking around the box to see if this was intended to make it an extra challenge, but I couldn't find anything.  The small poster was accurate.  I also did the Picasso puzzle, and while it only had a small poster, it did accurately match the puzzle.  Not sure if there was a misprint, but I'd still get this puzzle, just for the high quality of the pieces."
"Loved the quality of the puzzle for the graphics, the puzzle falls apart very easily so keep that in mind! Such a cute and fun puzzle to do, lots of references to TV shows and movies that are classic"
"We enjoyed putting together this puzzle only to find out there was ONE missing piece :(I wouldve rated it 5 stars with the quality otherwise."
"Not only was the puzzle excellent quality the customer service is outstanding. My puzzle was missing a piece. Not lost within my home but missing out of the box. They asked no questions about did I lose it. They replaced the puzzle. I have had this occur one other time with another manufacturer. No response ever received. And I hate puzzles with missing pieces! Recommend you buy this brand."
"Pieces connected really good and don’t fall apart immediately after connecting, cute and fun puzzle for all ages"
"This puzzle has great coloring and it was a great idea but the quality falls short. Way short. Lots of missing pieces and even extra pieces that have the correct picture but are cut wrong. Makes no sense how this can even happen. Beware!!"
"This puzzle is great quality. The pieces fit together well and the colors are great. It was bit challenging due to all the facial features being identical, but it was fun to figure out. Enjoy"
"Growing up, the Peanuts gang was a staple in my household. From the classic television specials to the beloved movies like Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown and the iconic holiday specials, these characters hold a special place in my heart. That's why when I came across the Peanuts 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle, I knew I had to give it a try.Putting together this puzzle was like taking a trip down memory lane. Each piece I connected brought a smile to my face as I recreated scenes from my favorite childhood memories. The challenge of the puzzle was just right - not too easy, but not too difficult either. It was the perfect way to spend a nostalgic afternoon, lost in the world of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and the rest of the gang.Overall, I highly recommend this puzzle for anyone who, like me, holds a deep affection for the Peanuts characters. It's a fun and rewarding way to relive those cherished moments from the past."
"Enjoyable and keepable experienceI really enjoyed this puzzle becauseIllustration is quite different than your ordinary photography. You now have to match the thickness of lines and hue, color variations and the faintest of difference. It really was challenging and fun. I am a tried and true snoopy fan so I was absolutely thrilled to see so many depictions of snoopy in one puzzle. This one is a keeper, I will frame it and continue to enjoy it.  No missing pieces or extra pieces just simple fun!"
"This was one of 2 puzzles I ordered/gave away as Christmas gifts recently. Both were excellent in quality, colours, fit, price etc. Totally recommended. I would give a full 5 star rating but 1 piece is missing. We do not have kids, no pets ate it, searched high and low in a very minimal room where we put the puzzle together. We are very sad that this piece is missing altogether. We spent HOURS putting it together, which was totally fun! So we're not going to take it apart and return it now."
"Well made. Adorable. Fun for family. Thank you."
"Galison puzzles are always wonderful and high quality. This one was especially beautiful with the metallic accents throughout. Every piece is solid and fits together perfectly. You can't ask for a better holiday puzzle!  LOVE it and highly recommend."
"This puzzle is beautiful. I love the gold foil accents. There is no dust detritus and the pieces snap in nicely."
"I love Galison puzzles and the foil ones are especially beautiful.  The snap together so nicely and so well you can lift the whole completed puzzle without it falling apart."
"Beautiful colors in an enchanting scene. Pieces hold together well, and need some effort to take apart when finished.  Overall, the puzzle is great and would recommend."
"I gave this to my daughter, who loves 1000 piece puzzles, and she told me how pretty it was and also challenging. After finishing it, she brought it to our house, and it stayed together without anything under it. We are thinking of framing it! Will definitely be getting her more of these. Very good price for the quality and pretty scenes!!"
"This puzzle was quite the challenge at times but that’s what makes it such great value for money! The colors are rich and vibrant and I loved the gold foil accents. The pieces fit really well together and you can truly pick it up by the corner and it all stays together. Highly recommend it."
"I really enjoyed assembling this one! The foil accents really make this puzzle “pop”! The vertical layout made it a bit awkward to assemble at times, but worth the wait. I will be looking for more of these foiled puzzles in the future."
"Love the gilded highlights on the puzzle. Puzzle box came in a plastic sleeve that protected the picture."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



We loved putting this together. The gold foil is beautiful! It was very sturdy and didn’t want to come apart—if you were wanting to modpodge this it would be very easy."
"You can't go wrong with a Galison jigsaw for quality and art, and this is no different. Beautiful puzzle."
"was expecting a 500 piece puzzle as described, however it was clearly a 1000 piece puzzle.  Returned and re-ordered and got the same results.  Returned second puzzle.  Disappointing."
"I was expecting finishing the puzzle before Christmas so I can put it on the wall for the holiday deco. Unfortunately, when I finally got to the end, I realized there were totally 10 pieces missing. Since I kept everything on a big table and was separate from other stuff, I couldn't think anywhere else that I might be able to find them. I have to return it since there's no hope to get it done before Christmas, even though I could ask for a replacement."
"This is the first time I’ve ordered from the brand and I was intrigued by the foil pieces. I ordered two puzzles at the same time and received one puzzle a day later than the other. The first puzzle I received does not have any foil on the pieces (disappointing); foil only on the box image of the puzzle. Since it’s the first time I’ve ordered from this brand and a foil puzzle, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. The second puzzle arrived today, winter lights, and this does have gold foil on the individual pieces in addition to the box, so I don’t know if I just got it defective version of the Presentville puzzle, that has no pieces with actual foil."
"I absolutely love this busy city at Christmas time seen with foil accents. It was fun to do and very well-made. It’s beautiful when finished! Highly recommend this brand and this puzzle!"
"After I finished it, I glued it with Mod Podge Puzzle Saver (2 layers) and hung it on the wall with Velcro Command Strips. It’s so cute!"
"Fun design, and I like the added sparkles to it."
"This was a gorgeous puzzle and we had a great time doing it. It was relatively easy -- it only took us (two adults) two hours to complete, which is not very long for a 500 piece puzzle. Overall really satisfied with the product. The gold foil was gorgeous!"
"This puzzle was great quality and beautiful. So nice to put together."
"Buy these Gallison 500 winter/Christams puzzles now, because they will be very popular."
"This puzzle has a bright, cheerful holiday graphic with foil accents that make it festive and a bit enchanting. Quality is good - printing is clear. The cuts are clean, joints are tight.  Most of the pieces are distinctive enough to identify but there are also challenging areas to change things up and slow the process down. I  expect I will do it again in years to come. It was a great value."
"Wait it for one month, but love it so muchBeautiful"
"It’s amazing because of the many piece and I loved the picture."
"There is no missing or defective piece in box, authenic product."
"Quality and thickness of this puzzle is what I am used to in the quality and standard of puzzles. I’m very satisfied with this purchase. I have not completed the puzzle yet, but it is very entertaining for me. To me it is not very difficult because every bird has its own colors And distinctions so it’s pretty easy to find the pieces that go with each bird. The nicest thing is that they add a very large color print of the puzzle to help you look up close to see if you can match a piece to where it goes. I think the hard part will be filling in the background. I have completed most of the birds. I glue them and frame them when I finish them, and use them as pictures on the wall. And just FYI if you are new to gluing puzzles, use puzzle glue and a paintbrush that is wide and thin. Mine is about 1 1/2 inches wide with bristles that will not fall out, so they don’t get stuck to your puzzle. once the top side of the puzzle is dry flip it and glue the backside as well if you intend to frame it and hang it After it is dry. Do not glue your puzzle on a valuable piece of furniture. I use a card table. The glue will wipe off after you complete gluing it. Enjoy!"
"Enjoyed putting this puzzle together.  Not too hard, but hard enough."
"Can't wait to put this puzzle together reminds me of spring.  Recommend this company for their pzzles"
"this one was glued together, and is currently hanging on someone's wall in the middle east"
"This puzzle is beautiful and also very challenging! I bought a puzzle frame for it because I love it so much! Unfortunately it is missing a piece. I look absolutely everywhere and did not find the piece, so one can only assume that it was left out of the box prior to shipment. The product support doesn’t resolve this issue, as they “can’t” send me a replacement puzzle. It’s very disappointing and it makes me think I’ll buy puzzles in the future from a different brand with a product support that actually resolves issues like this."
"It’s a little bit of a hard puzzle to do, but so nice when finished! I’ll probably frame this one!"
"Bought as gift for wife and she was just thrilled working this puzzle. Really detailed picture. In fact, so nice looking you don’t want to take it apart."
"The picture is being once finished and we will frame itMy husband loves doing puzzles during the grey winter months when most activities are in the house. So he has it set up in the living room on a puzzle table which was also a great purchase as easy to set up and leave for anyone else wanting to try .He has done 2 other 1000 piece puzzle but this one is particularly difficult . It’s deceiving because one thinks that because it has different coloured birds it would be a cinch . It’s not ! This is why I bought it because the other two puzzles were not too hard and finished quickly. A good way to get into puzzles though is to start with easier 1000 piece puzzle. I picked the puzzle with the purpose of framing and hanging in houseThey really look nice framed"
"Happy with the quality"
"Title says it all. Highly recommended."
"A decently build puzzle that offers a good thickness that allowes the puzzle to be built on a puzzle board. Amazing color as well as all correct pieces (non missing). I get puzzles for my mom all fall and winter as she can complete a 1000 piece puzzle in a week so they are constant purchases. I highly encourage others to try it out!"
"Nice puzzle, fits well and looks great"
"I enjoyed the picture and vibrant colors but this one was challenging for me.  I thought I was advanced at puzzles but this one was difficult in my opinion.  Still enjoyed it though. Missing one piece  but it's possibly my fault."
"Enjoyed this puzzle.Pros:- Nice quality pieces.- Nice colors.- Fit together snugly.- Letter codes on the back help with sorting the pieces so you can work on a section of the puzzle at a time.Cons:- Shiny finish, so there's a glare from overhead lights. A matte or linen finish would be much easier and nicer.- Fairly normal piece shapes.- I wasn't a fan of the areas that were devoid of graphics, leaving the puzzler with having to put together two mostly black areas of the puzzle and some other areas of blank background, but that's due to the pattern I chose to purchase. I'll watch for that in future purchases.I would buy this brand again if they went to a matte or linen finish. Extra bonus if they add unusual piece shapes.Four stars due to my personal cons/preferences in puzzles. If these things don't bother you, then you'll probably enjoy this puzzle."
"I bought this for a gift and the recipient was very pleased with the puzzle."
"The puzzle was challenging as expected.  But it was gorgeous when finished.  Pieces were made well; no problem with interlocking properly.  For someone who wants to have help, you may look on the reverse side of each piece for a letter that will let you know what part of the puzzle it will fit.  Of course, it doesn't give you the exact location, but it will give you a general idea of where the piece belongs.  This one takes time to finish."
"I got this as a challenge for myself and it was definitely a challenge. Very beautiful though and a nice size"
"I love this puzzle because of the way the cardboard is made. The puzzle itself is beautiful. I have a dozen or more on my wall that I’ve made from this company product as well and the pictures are beautiful.."
"This puzzle was so much fun to put together. Different from all the Christmas scene puzzles.Nice size pieces and well made. Highly reccomend!"
"Love WM puzzles……The high quality puzzle pieces and images are the reason I only buy WM puzzles…."
"Very cute, fun puzzle for the holidays.  I just finished it this morning.  It was made up of old Golden Books Christmas Carols of the past.  Many books were ones I had in  my youth.  This would be great fun to do with Children.  Not too hard, not too easy.  Very colorful."
"What a fun puzzle! NO missing pieces - in excellent new condition - exactly as advertised. As I was putting the puzzle together, I had to sing all of the Christmas carols that I was seeing. This would be a great family activity, especially before Christmas!"
"One piece was missing and one piece received two of the same.  Always love White Mountain puzzles, first time this has happened."
"I really enjoyed putting this together. It’s not that hard to do but it’s a lot of fun. It would be a great family puzzle. Plus it’s really cute. I’ve been buying White Mountain jigsaws for years and have never had a problem with any of them"
"I love White Mt. Puzzles"
"Like that it is made in the USA"
"I just love this puzzle. It's well made, and so much fun to put together."
"Great puzzle and lovely quality. My favourite Xmas puzzle."
"BUFFALO brand jigsaw puzzles are colorful, detailed & glossy. The pieces snap together snug and don’t fall apart. The pieces are cut into varied shapes including zigzag. A large foldout photo of the puzzle is included in the box. This puzzle is good for SENIOR CITIZENS for stimulating brain activity, and fine motor skills (use of fingers). My 89 year old Father and I love to put BUFFALO brand puzzles together. Highly recommend"
"This puzzle was really tough to work, but it is really pretty.  I would recommend it."
"Very cute, fun and good quality puzzle."
"We love Buffalo puzzles. Our family put it together in a couple hours. No missing pieces, quality picture was great."
"Fun puzzle to work."
"East to put together"
"Very, very disappointed that is puzzle pieces were not completely cut, so they were being torn apart where pieces come together. As you can see in picture I'm sending you, the pieces of the backing torn off is on the bottom left. I have been buying Buffalo puzzles for a long time, and lately, I have either gotten some with too much puzzle dust or the mentioned problem. The company seems to be using cheaper type of whatever it uses to make the puzzles. Yet, the prices keep going higher and higher. Other than that, I do like your country life series."
"Pieces were not cut completely."
"I have at least a dozen buffalo games puzzles and love them, but I won’t be buying another Buffalo Games Puzzle in the near future.I am in competitive jigsaw competitions and used this puzzle to practice but we’re not allowed to look at the pieces ahead of time and have to accept the pieces as we find them. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get an accurate test because quite a few pieces were badly bent and twisted, and at least 30% of the puzzle was not cut properly. (Hanging chads as one reviewer pointed out.) I had to waste a lot of time trying to fix the pieces. This is not the standard I’m used to with buffalo puzzles and will notify all my puzzle groups."
"This is an enjoyable and colorful puzzle.  I did have a missing edge piece, which was disappointing, but noting the guarantee I contacted the company and they replaced the puzzle without hassle...good customer relations.The pieces are a bit thin and don't snap together like some puzzles.  If bumped it's easy to knock some out of place, but otherwise it was a fun puzzle...not too easy, not too difficult.  The picture is very nice, with an included poster to ease putting it together.  These are a change from the most common puzzle scenes, so will probably try some more from this company."
"This was an easier puzzle to finish than I expected. Sorting and building the border took a solid 3 hours. After that, I spent an additional 16 hours to complete the 1,000-piece puzzle. It's very detailed, super cute but some pieces were tricky to place. Overall, it was one of my favorites!"
"I love this puzzle not only because it shows a 1956 Packard, my first car, but has unique pieces.  They are shaped like no other puzzle i have worked on.  Even some very small pieces.  It doesn't lock together as tightly as the average puzzle, but it doesn't fall apart easily either.  The picture is interesting and very detailed.  I will be looking for another like this.  Especially one with old cars and trucks.  The cat and dogs were also a plus.  I highly recommend this puzzle."
"It was a great puzzle. Fun to put together and pretty when done."
"I enjoyed putting this puzzle together, but was not happy with how the pieces fit together. Sometimes they did not lock into place which made it difficult to keep Parts of the puzzle together. No Missing pieces. Because of the many different colors it was less challenging then some puzzles, but I enjoyed it."
"A great and fun puzzle.  David Maclean has wonderful designs and puzzle material is durable and sturdy."
"I love doing jigsaw puzzles, including the Wasgij puzzles.  Not too much of one single color made it fun.  Took a couple of weeks due to my schedule, but it was fun."
"I have purchased a number of Ceaco puzzles and missing pieces are a frequent problem. I shall not be buying this brand in the future."
"This rollup mat is great! It’s good quality, rolls up easily, and stores away in a convenient pouch. It is BIG! It almost fills my large dining room table! I usually only do 300-500 piece puzzles. Therefore, a mat of half the size of this one would be fine for me. This mat could easily hold puzzles of much larger size. (1000-1500 or even larger)! So if you enjoy working jigsaw puzzles that are 1000 pieces or more, you will think it’s perfect!"
"Not going to lie I was a little apprehensive of this but it seriously works perfectly. The pad is nice and thick. Non slip on bottom and nice smooth material on top. The guide lines for puzzle size is really nice but of course some puzzles are a little different/irregular so they don't always line up to the size. So easy to roll up and unroll and the puzzle really stays put no matter what level of completion you're at. It does move/slide slightly while rolling up but nothing that messes it up that can't easily be adjusted back. I had a cheaper style that I got as a promotion from a book store but it's not even remotely as nice as this one...was only thin felt and a blow up tube. So glad I got this one instead. Very sturdy and easy to use."
"So much detail put into it. Love the ease of bringing a puzzle places or being able to put it away. The sorting bins were nice too. Mat feels nice and like it’s high quality."
"I do like this item for keeping my puzzle organized and easy to try again to finish up my puzzle. I did look around for other options but I don’t have a table yet and I don’t want to purchase the upright one since I do want to watch my tv while working on the puzzle. It’s easy to roll up and I like how it has 3 pouches to separate the puzzles. The only reason I added a 4 star is bc Since I do lay it on my bed while working on the puzzle there’s a small lump . It’s kinda annoying but it’s a small price to pay compared to everything else it does for me. When i roll it out it does keep my puzzle to where I left off; so I do enjoy how easy it is to have space in my room."
"This Mat  comes in a nice solid box. ""Open gently"" Included is a decent carrying bag. It comes with durable velcro straps to help  secure your puzzle If you want to stow it away.  The mat is of a good quality, durable and non-linty. There are different measurements on the map for different size puzzles which is not necessary but a nice added feature, for setting your border. I think any puzzle enthusiast would enjoy this mat. It's worth the money."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



This is the second puzzle saver I have owned.  The first came with a blow up roll and was made of felt.  It didn’t work at all!  I gave up the idea of putting together puzzles as I had a cat that carried off pieces and chewed them up.Recently, I was given a free puzzle and decided to see if they had any other way to safely store puzzles.  This one got great reviews and I decided to give it a chance.  I got the one that lets you store a puzzle up to 1500 pieces.  It is a great size and any bigger, it wouldn’t have fit.  I found that you need to roll up and open the puzzle slowly so the pieces stay in place and to smooth your hand over it as you unroll.  It is easy to use as along as you make slower movements.The puzzle saver stores nicely, but after just a few uses, the velcro straps are fraying a bit.  The underside collects dirt and hair easily due to static and is a bit annoying when rolling up if you have pets as it gets on your puzzle.  It also tends to shock you with static electricity as you unroll it which is kind of funny.  I like that it is black even though it shows any dirt because the puzzle pieces show up well against it."
"I ordered this for our family ahead of the hurricanes in preparation for activities while without power and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Impressed with the quality and even allowed us to take the puzzle from hotel to hotel when we evacuated without losing any pieces. Allowed us some distraction from what was a dangerous storm. We ordered this with the “all-you-need puzzle set” and the kids really liked having the extra containers for easier sorting. Now they want to hang the puzzle since it came with hangers."
"When I started getting into building puzzles I realized there was no way I was going to complete them in a single seating and I didn’t have the room to just leave the incomplete puzzle on a table.  I’m glad to have found this mat.  I like that it has the dimensions of the puzzle on the mat and the material feels very high quality.  The trays are easy to use and roll up nicely with the mat.  The best part is that it works perfectly.  I rolled up my puzzle and put the roll into the included bag.  It was moved around quite a bit over a couple of months and when I finally got around to returning to the puzzle, it was just as I left it.  I just needed to push a few piece flat.  I won’t do a puzzle without this mat."
"Excellent to use and roll up till I do more the next day"
"It's well made and very easy to use. Nice bag for when not in use."
"I have bought a few 2 packs puzzles made by Spin Master.  I think these are the best quality. Great pictures, paper and colors. Pieces fit snug. Will not fall a part when  you pick up a group of pieces put together."
"These are surprisingly high quality puzzles with a very nice matte finish and great image quality. The subjects are fun — and real. One is pulp magazine covers from the ‘50’s, the other is fruit crate labels from the same era. I’ve included a few pics of the magazine covers, both overall and close-up. Most cover subjects that are off-limits today, either from stereotypes (the “stewardess” and the Captain) or bordering on exploitation. But they all existed, and were widely sold to teens and young adults as ”Romance Magazines”. How far we’ve come in such a relatively short time.These are especially good for multiple puzzlers, as you can each work on an area as a “mini puzzle”. The individual magazine cover art is distinctive enough in color and style to be able to find “your” piece from hundreds of other pieces relatively quickly. For example, there is lots of red or yelllow or blue in the covers, but each is slightly different, so a careful eye can find the same shade, which is probably unique to a particular magazine cover. Ditto the font colors and styles.The same is true for the fruit crate labels, although we’re in the middle of that one so no pics — but it’s great fun to see the artwork and creativity that went into these labels “back in the day”. I grew up surrounded by fruit orchards in Washington State, and likely ate fruit from some of these concerns 60 to 70 years ago. I may have even picked for a couple of them, as it was common in the ‘50’s for orchards to hire teens who were looking to make a few bucks. We would ride our bikes to the orchards, pick all day, eat too much fruit, get a few bucks, then ride home. They also used professional migrant pickers, but were kind (or smart) enough to also hire local kids, which was a boost to our little individual bottom lines — and the local “baseball trading card and bubble gum pack” economy.Only downside is there is no paper image to work from — only the small image on the back of the box. We solved that by scanning, enlarging (to 8-1/2 X 11) and printing multiple copies so we all have our own “crib sheet”, which makes the group puzzling much more fun.I would gladly pay more to have a foldable puzzle image included, as many (costlier) puzzle-makers do. But as far as image and product quality go, these are up with puzzles costing three times as much."
"This Jigsaw Puzzles is enjoyable, but I wouldn’t recommend it for kids under 10. The puzzle pieces aren’t very clear, and there’s no support picture included, which makes it tougher to complete. It's still a good challenge for adults or older kids, but having a reference image would have made it easier to follow along."
"The bottle puzzle was the hardest.  Both were fun to do.  Definitely worth the price."
"We really enjoyed these puzzles.  The pieces are not the sturdiest we've ever worked with but plenty good enough and none were missing.  Lots of colors, texture and text in the design made them fairly easy to work.  We did wish for either a bonus poster or at least a good larger size view of the puzzle on the box but for the price we're not complaining.  It just added to the challenge and we appreciate that."
"One piece is missing! I notice this a lot for puzzle reviews… so sad. I would have gladly given 5 stars otherwise."
"Bought this as a Christmas gift. Perfect for puzzle lovers."
"enjoyed both puzzles.  good quality construction.  the comic covers were so fun and the fruit labels were quite pretty."
"The images were clear, the puzzle pieces went together well and stayed attached.  This was absolutely good value for the money."
"Good quality puzzle pieces.  You can tell whether two pieces fit together or not, versus cheap puzzle pieces."
"These two puzzles were enjoyable to do. The images were sharp and clear. Colourful and pretty settings too. The price was gd too. Highly recommended."
"This game is a lot of fun and it’s easy to use. It was easy to put together and it comes with a nice storage bag. The appearance is colorful and cute. And it seems a little sturdier than other ones that I’ve."
"Easy to set up, fun for all ages. Quality of tossing balls is much better than most out there."
"This ladder golf set is a great purchase. It's not only economical, but it's made of durable piping (so pieces won't rust, bend, deteriorate), its SUPER easy to assemble and disassemble, it has a built-in score keeping, and the bolas are made of some kind of rubber, instead of hard plastic, so I'm comfortable letting my young nephews play with them.  I haven't had this set long, so I can't be positive as to how it'll hold up, but none of the elements look like they'll fail soon. The ONLY suggestion I'd make, is to provide stakes to keep it from tipping over; while the base is a good size and shape, it can tip over if the bolas are thrown with force (as my family is known to do!). We'll probably use some tent stakes, but this is does not retract from the quality of the set, or my recommendation to purchase it!!!!"
"Its a little flimsy but super easy to set and fun to use! I like having the scoring on the sides."
"This game quickly became a fan favorite at our community picnic. It was easy to assemble, endured wind gusts of 30 to 40 miles an hour without moving, was enjoyed by all ages, and packed away neatly in the bags provided. I needed an extra part and the company was wonderful to work with. I won't hesitate to buy more of their products."
"This is the perfect family game! We used to play a lot of corn hole outside but the boards are SO heavy. It’s really not practical to bring with us on family outings. This ladder toss set is easy to put together, lightweight, and super easy to throw in the car for family picnics at the park, camping, bbqs, etc. It might be hard for really young kids to play, but my 7 year old enjoys it.  My only complaint has to do with the scoring system. One of the “ladders” has numbers painted on both sides, with a pieces of plastic that slide up and down to keep score. After several uses, I noticed that the painted numbers are starting to get scratched off by the plastic slider. I’m pretty sure the numbers will be scraped off all the way after a year of normal use. This could be prevented by having the numbers etched and painted (though that would probably make it more expensive to produce) or somehow making the plastic slider smoother (maybe by having some kind of felt lining?). Overall I highly recommend this game though, even with the scoring issues."
"This ladder golf game is fun for bbq’s, birthday parties or just hanging out. This set up was extremely easy to put together, zero issues with directions. Posts are made of a sturdy plastic & balls are as well. Great value for this set up, would recommend anyone to purchase it."
"This was a gift for our 10 y/o granddaughter, but very nice quality and it fits nicely into a small bag for travel.  Highly recommend this product. Love the score keeper on each rack which is color coordinated to the balls."
"Easily assembled, for hours of fun, friendly competition as it comes complete with score keepers."
"Great for all ages"
"Good quality, easy to assemble but when you move the game the pieces fall out. Would be nice if there was something to keep them together until you disassemble it."
"This is great! This set of laser tag guns cost about $30 more than comparable units but after researching many sets the common thread was how much a paint is to keep so many batteries around..so, I opted for this set that is rechargeable and I’m so glad I did! This set is very easy to charge, the charge lasts, and it’s truly an easy to use set of laser tag guns that work great! If I had any suggestion for improvement it would be that you have a way to know if you shot an opponent in real time so you know how many lives your opponent has, but this is just being  critical because it’s all around a great product!-Keith M.Pcola Fl."
"I saw a few cheaper sets of laser tag on Amazon, but all of them used 20 AA batteries. I know the added cost of having to replace that many batteries would exceed the cost of this set in the end, so I went the rechargable route. I’m glad I did too because it’s a whole lot of fun, and at this point I would have already spent close to the same amount if I had to replace the batteries. Everything works great, no technical issues or anything with the set we bought. My son (8 yrs) and his friends have fun, and we’ve also had fun as a family playing together. A great gift!"
"This product is great. Very easy to use. Battery life is great and love that it is rechargeable with the standard 5V USB. My kids love to switch modes between teams or individual play. Also fun you can switch to stealth mode to silence my gun, and even go dark and turn off the lights."
"Great fun!!!! Worth the money!!"
"We've used this quite often and have had a ton of fun with the kids! I'm always a little scared buying things from brands I don't already recognize, but in this case the quality was excellent. Everything is well-made, works well, and I don't have any concerns about longevity.I'd also recommend considering the other model from this brand with the targets you wear on your back. After seeing the quality, I might have considered buying those if I could do it all over again."
"I got these as a Christmas gift for my grandchildren. They (and myself) have had so much fun playing with them. We’re Building memories!They came fully charged and ready to use.They also hold the charge for a good while.Well worth every penny!"
"We got these for Our sons birthday and now we are looking at getting a second set because he and his friends love them so much but we often have more than 4 boys at a time over to play. Easy to use but tricky to store wish the storage bads that come with them were bigger with a drawstring so they could function a little better but overall we have been impressed. And buying these was cheaper than one trip to the Lazer tag place in town for a birthday party."
"I got this for my son last Christmas! never even used it but we opened it and put them all on it's definitely an awesome product but he just never used it yet!"
"The Rechargeable Laser Tag Set for kids, teens, and adults is an absolute blast! It comes with gun and vest sensors, providing a realistic and immersive experience. The rechargeable feature is a huge plus, saving the hassle and cost of constantly replacing batteries. The set is well-made and durable, standing up to energetic play. It's great for both indoor and outdoor use, making it perfect for family gatherings, parties, or just some fun competition. This laser tag set is a hit for all ages, offering hours of entertainment."
"Bought this for my brother & his kids when they came to visit. I wasn’t sure what yo expect but it was really good. It kept the kids entertained for days & seemed to work for all of them (ages ranged from 3 to 16 years) which was a bonus. It wasn’t too loud or annoying either which is a bonus. Everything was good quality & battery lasted a long time."
"An outstanding toy for the whole fam. This got opened during the birthday & took over the show! We’re now considering getting a second set for a 4-on-4 battle."
"These are fun and they stay charged long enough not to have to recharge in middle of game."
"The kids love this so much we've already worn it out mostly we've only had it one season. The darts are in good shape but the connections that make the ring stay together are starting to weaken."
"My grandsons enjoyed this game. We were disappointed when one of the tail fins broke off within the first hour of play.  Other than that it is a fun game for kids"
"Played with the dangerous ones when we were young these are still really cool and work the same just less dangerous maybe they are on the heavy side being filled with sand. But they are lots of fun to be had by all."
"The shafts of the glow in the dark wings broke on all of the throw darts within the first hour.  Some wings broke as well."
"One fin of the dart broke on first day of use, rings just refuse to stay flat on the ground so you can toss darts into the ring.  Not worth the money."
"We really enjoyed this game."
"The rings are really flimsy and do not lay flat.  The ""darts"" are decent quality.  The ""carrying bag"" is a joke.  Just not worth the money."
"A good time was had by all."
"Very pleased with the cornhole set. Exactly as advertised. But even more impressed with their customer service support. The shipping box was damaged in shipment. The cornhole platforms were not damaged but the carrying case was torn. I reached out to the seller and they expeditiously replaced the case without hassle. Great customer service."
"They do appear cheaply made but for the price you can't get better. They work great and look nice."
"EDITED COMMENT: After a disappointment of one of the boards breaking after only 3 uses, I reached out to GoSport customer service, and they were very quick to respond and send me a replacement for the broken board. I told them that I would update my rough review to reflect the service, however, I also told them that I would update it again if there is an issue that soon again. I was assured that I would be happier with the product they sent as a replacement, and that the first issue was a fluke. That is what I am hoping for! It is a great set of bags, and I hope they last for a long time!ORIGINAL COMMENT: This set of boards is a very nice looking set, and compared to other sets I have owned/used, they seemed like great quality. However, after only 3 uses after receiving it as a gift, I already noticing strange bouncing when a bag would be thrown on one of the boards, and after inspecting it, I found a large crack on the bottom of one side.I was extremely disappointed that this happened so quickly, and am hoping it was just a flaw in the manufacturing of this one board. I am submitting a warranty claim, and hoping to give the set another try.For such a high price, there is no reason for this sort of lack of quality."
"Received my product, noticed a small tear in the carrying case.  Reached out to the go sports customer service to see if I could get just a replacement bag in order to not waste the product by returning through Amazon.  I not only got a response by the next business day, after a quick proof of purchase they shipped out a new bag with tracking.  10/10 recommend if just for their customer service team.  Kaley was the absolute bees knees and deserves a raise!"
"The boards are great and easy enough to carry. We bought this with the intention of traveling with it and having a ready to go back yard game."
"Let me begin by saying that we love playing with our GoSports Classic Cornhole Set.  We have had our set for about 10 weeks now.  The boards are sturdy and if not exposed to the elements, should last a long time.  The beanbags are heavy duty and seem to be well made.  Then why three stars, you ask?  It's the carrying case and the customer service that pulls down this rating.  The first is cheaply made and the second is nonexistent.  The carrying case is important a) because this set is heavy to pack around and b) because, as already mentioned, you need to keep exposure to the elements to a minimum.  Not one but both of our zippers on the case have simply come off after only a few uses, rendering the case useless.  We then pulled out the insert from the company that came with our set.  It thanked us for our business and asked for a review; it also included an email address (no phone number) and implored us to please contact them with any issues we have before leaving a negative review so they could try to make things right.  Well, we tried...unfortunately, it is an undeliverable email to nowhere.  We can't find a way anywhere to contact this company, so without access to customer service or a decent bag to protect our investment, we cannot give more than three stars - that is because the carrying case and the customer service get zero stars.  And Go Sports, you should know that because you provide no contact information or customer service, we have decided to go with another company for the ladderball set we plan to purchase.  Too bad....this a great game, but buyer beware if you have any issues."
"I actually thought the rough wood would be a A problem, but it actually just looks like rough wood, but is Very smooth, which allows the bags to slide right in the hole! This is great quality."
"As long as you don't leave these out in the rain, they're great.  They are made of plywood and would come apart easily.  But they are fairly priced.  They come with a nice storage bag."
"Seems to be very sturdy. Like the football field design."
"I got this for a birthday party so we could have an extra activity for the guests at the party. It arrived in a large box and inside the boards and bags came in a carry bag. Having a bag to store and carry this is super helpful, as it keeps everything together. The bean bags are thick, and yet light enough so you can throw them easily. The boards held up and have a stand to adjust the level you want. There were kids and adults both enjoying this cornhole game. I would say don't let the kids stand on the boards as it's not that sturdy but I would recommend this for a majority of ages."
"This checker set is great to take with you on a picnic. Fun and naturally an easy and fun game for both adults and children. Highly recommend if you are looking to provide games for people to have some fun. The checker board is cloth and the pieces and large and looks great when set up on a table or blanket. Gets good mark from me. Very affordable."
"Very good quality. For the price it surprised me how well it was made. Should last us a long time. Very easy to store as the mat folds up small."
"Looks okay, but the overall size of the board and the checker pieces is disappointing.  Had assumed, based on the picture with the single girl playing, it was at least 3 - 3 1/2 feet wide / tall.  Checker pieces are likewise smaller in diameter than anticipated and not as thick as assumed.  But, in the end the game is still useable and playable."
"I always loved checkers. Taught my grandkids to play and the love it. Easy to keep up with the large pieces."
"This item was received promptly as promised by the seller.Our grandbabies love this item!!  The oldest (5 yrs) is a whiz at tic tac toe, but had never played checkers.  She’s loving learning and is becoming quite good at it.  Our just 3 yr old is now learning to play tic tac toe and she’s very excited!Definitely worth the money, good quality and an easy size to use either on the floor/ground or table top.  We would highly recommend this item!"
"I bought this to put out at a grade party at a game table. It was heavy enough not to blow away."
"Arrived as described.  Good product.  I’d buy it again."
"This larger sized game catches everyone’s attention and add a little extra fun to the game.  Chips and fabric are great quality."
"The pieces and carpet itself are smaller than in the picture (pencil for reference). A bit of the thread started to become separated but with scissors it was fine. This is a fun item but for $25 it is not worth it."
"Combining dodgeball with a card game is a brilliant idea, and it’s a lot of fun to play with friends and family. The rules are easy to understand, and the game is highly engaging. Highly recommend for game nights."
"Exploding kittens makes the best games! This one is super active and so much fun!"
"Fun active game. Our children love the action of throwing the soft burritos. Even when thrown what would seem hard, still doesn't cause any physical discomfort. With adults its the same and you can make it a drinking game to add to the adult fun if you choose to. Great for family/friends game night."
"I didn’t know I’d be scrubbing blood out of the living room carpet on Christmas Day at 10:30p.m., but there I was, having to decide whether I pull out cleaning solution or if I just call it a night and go to bed. It’s all still a bit of a blur, but for proper context, allow me to start from the beginning.My teenage sister loves family board games, and Exploding Kittens is a favorite of hers. She’s mentioned a few times this year that she really, really wanted to try Throw Throw Burrito. Being the amazing older sister that I am, I added this to my Amazon cart and had it shipped to me to wrap for her to open Christmas morning. Did I do my research? No, this is where I made a grave mistake, but more on that later. When my sister tore the paper on Christmas morning to find this long-awaited game, thrilled shouts rang out around the room from fellow family members who looked forward to playing. The pride of a great gift given washed over me in this moment, and I took another sip of hot coffee, happy with the successful purchase. Looking back to that moment, I now see just how naive I was.After Christmas dinner had been eaten and the rest of dessert polished off, 6 of us gathered in the living room and sat down in a big circle on the floor to play Throw Throw Burrito. As I was reading the instructions, I grew concerned. Even though the name is “Throw Throw Burrito,” somehow I thought it would be more like “Toss Toss Burrito.” I swallowed my concern and we dealt everyone in. The game starts and we’re getting the hang of it and it’s a little aggressive...and then someone called a duel. I don’t remember who or how I ended up standing back-to-back with my younger brother who is a head taller and twice my size, but next thing I knew someone yelled “3...2...1... Burrito!” and I was no longer in the living room. Adrenaline surged through my veins and I was on a battlefield. I tried to dodge a burrito and chuck one all at the same time, and we both missed. Glass bulbs clanged on the Christmas tree, other players shouted from the sidelines, and I scrambled to find a burrito on the floor before my brother could get the other and hit me with it. Only thing is—I couldn’t find it. It was lost to me forever, so I had one option: run. I ran faster than I’ve ever run in my adult life as this grown, built-like-bull beast of a man chased me around the living room, nearly causing an earthquake to rupture across the American Midwest. I had nowhere to turn but to keep running around the room before he could hit me. This is where things start to get fuzzy, because my heart is racing and I’m running for my EVER. LOVING. LIFE. Suddenly, my foot slides against a game card and I fly, falling face-down into the carpet. I lie there for a second trying to process all that just transpired when I feel the harrowing finality of a burrito hitting me in the back. The competitive screams turn to silence, and someone says, “Uh, you ok?”I carefully pick myself—and my pride—up off the floor. We all make our way back into the circle, the game we once played long gone, scattered in a disarray across the room. Some announced how this was the most fun they’d ever had during a card game, and still reconciling in my mind what just occurred, I let them know that no one could ever convince me to play this awful game again.My sister rolled her eyes and we straightened the cards best we could to get back to the round at hand. I feel my foot throbbing and I look down, only to see blood running down the side of it. I’m not sure at what point I was injured during my burrito civil war, but there was a gash on my foot. “I’m bleeding!” I exclaim, and my fellow players just start laughing. We finished the game around 10:30 in the evening, and I left to properly bandage my foot. I come back and as we’re putting the game away I see a blood stain in the white carpet where I had fallen just minutes prior. The big question now was, do I scrub the blood out of my mother’s white carpet, or just call it a night? Who knew this is how the Christmas of 2020 would draw to a close?All that being said, buyer beware: this is no game of “Toss Toss Burrito.” This, indeed, is “Throw Throw Burrito,” and may bring out a new side you’ve never seen before of the people you play with. And, bad mood and wounded pride aside, it was actually pretty fun. We played it again last night and while bulbs clanged against the Christmas tree again, no one was majorly injured. The burritos are already cracked and one is missing a chunk, so I don’t think they’ll last very long, but Throw Throw Burrito is quite the entertaining game nonetheless.All I can say now, fellow potential purchaser, is good luck."
"Very fun and chaotic for the whole family."
"Really nothing wrong with a game that involves dueling burritos. Just fun and easy to understand."
"The game is fun, it is fast-paced, and it was a really good therapy tool for my kid with selective mutism as it encourages verbal interaction in a fun setting. Younger kids can play alongside older kids and adults. Great game!"
"We're hosting an extended family game night next week and I wanted something new & different to play that everyone would enjoy. Our family loves rummy, PIT! and other card games so I figured I'd give 'Throw Throw Burrito' a try, even though we've never played or purchased 'Exploding Kittens' or any other of their games. And also even though someone in my family tends to injure themselves every single time we all get together.Yesterday when this arrived, my husband and I sat down to learn how to play so that we can teach everyone else on game night. It is easy to learn and appropriate for all ages. It was great fun playing this, even with just two people, and it'd be a lot more fun with a bigger group.So I matched the 'Burrito War' cards which means everyone grabs for a burrito and throw it at another player. I whipped a burrito at my husband's chest except it accidentally hit him in the face because 1) I have terrible (or great?) aim and 2) we were sitting at very close range to each other.Consequently, he informed me that 'we' are not allowed to play this game anymore. When he said 'we' I knew he meant me. I am not allowed to play because I cannot be trusted to not hit him in the face with a squishy burrito. He hid the box but I know where and I am totally breaking this out on family game night!"
"My son is 9 and this is the game he always wants to play on game night.  It's an easy game to learn and lots of kids/people can play at the same time.  Only thing is, play somewhere where you won't be afraid something may be knocked over by a flying burrito!  Good game for birthday parties too."
"This is basically the card game Spoons, but more extravagant and crazy and we love it! Takes a while to inflate and deflate and the burritos are pretty big, but we'll worth it! Easy for young children to learn and play."
"This was a housewarming gift and will bring hours of fun! Good quality and an easy fit for its carrying case."
"The blocks are a nice size, very smooth and lightweight. Love the bag, dice and score board that were included. Not disappointed."
"The oversized blocks make it more fun than the original game, but it still fits on a table. The blocks easily fit back in the package for easy portability. We take it camping and itâ€™s always a hit for those around us."
"We had a great time with this, hours of entertainment"
"Not sure what the dice is for but they are made well and fun for parties."
"I was looking for an outdoor ""Jenga"" style block tower that was good for family fun with kids. This is a fun set and priced well.Background: We already have the small indoor Jenga that my kids love but with it being summer and us wanting to spend more time outdoors, I wanted to get a larger set. I first started looking at the Jenga GIANT but couldn't believe how expensive they were, then found similar listings and settled on the Megwoz Giant Tumbler Tower.How big is it: It is comparable in size to the Jenga GIANT but about 1/3rd the price. It's about 2 feet tall when set up, reaches up to 4 feet tall depending on how good you are. If you want to expand the set, you can buy another set as it doesn't look like they sell an expansion kit.How durable is it: One difference to Jenga GIANT is the wood type. Jenga GIANT is made of a more durable hardwood while this set is made of pine wood. However, I've got other outdoor pine wood games like a Kubb game that holds up to more abuse, so pine wood will hold up fine for a low impact tower tumble game.My wife and I play with our 6 year olds and they have a blast. I recommend finding a crate or small table that you can set up so it's about 1-2 feet off the ground (especially for the adults who can't bend as low as kids). You'll thank me after bending and squatting down over and over. Easily hours of fun for adults, kids or mixed.Setup is easy, stack and play. They include a pair of dice in case you want to change it up and make it more challenging. Instead of stacking one at a time, you have to stack the number you roll.When putting them away, the bag is a snug but will fit everything, so here's a tip. Put down 10 pieces per row, you will have to line them up so the short width is facing down (you won't be able to fit 10 per row and will run out of room if you place any other side down). See one of my pics of it packed away for an example. They'll be a little bit of room on the top row, so don't panic and think you're missing something. There's 56 pieces to stack up, which is 19 rows (18 rows of 3 across and a bottom row with 2 pieces apart)."
"I bought this to use for a work event and it was perfect! Well made and love the carrying case!"
"These looked huge in the pictures, so we got them. They were much smaller than we thought. BUT they were the stated size in the descriptions so still 5 stars. Most of the ones sold on Amazon are between 6"" and 7"" long. See if you can find ones that are >12"" long. We played with this truly giant logs at a campsite once, and it's been nearly impossible to find them."
"Canâ€™t go wrong with this game. So much fun for all bought for a company event. Everyone had a blast playing it."
"Product is fun and perfect"
"Good product you couldnâ€™t build it for this price itâ€™s a fun activity for families, groups and even at work"
"Bought for our Christmas entertainment gift for a family gathering."
"Great size, comes with a case, very secure"
"9 year old and 5 year old both use this MULTIPLE times a day! Santa hit a home run! (Still toys unopened in favor of this.)1 arrow did break, but was easily glued. Clean break, no shattered pieces.One bow has half working lights, but 9 doesn't like them anyway."
"Great set especially for the price. Targets not real tall but great for kids."
"It was fun getting it set up and playing, love that it lights up and the light nerf guns with suction cup bullets. However its starting to break, we had it a little bit before Christmas. Like the little piece that helps guide the arrow broke off, the arm to the bow wont fold close anymore."
"I got these for my nephews and godson and they were a major hit this holiday!! GREAT QUALITY and super easy to set up and store! One of my better finds/ buys!"
"This was a gift for my grandson, when he open it he was so happy. This is a great gift to give any boy. Even his Mom started playing with him."
"Okay product. Not the best quality and breaks easy. That being said kids loved it . Colors are as they look in pictures"
"Gave this to my boyfriends nephew and he loved it, it’s a great set for the price"
"Son-in-Law and Grandson is loving this. It comes with 2 bows and 2 foam darts guns and a target. Easy set-up and hours of fun for 1 or 2 people."
"Grandchildren love it, works well, pretty good quality."
"3 out of the 20 bullets wouldn’t stick to the target board at all.2 out of the 20 arrows have very weak suction to the board.The target was easy to assemble.The guns were not very easy for kids to load without touching the suction cup, but it’s doable.Bows are not too tight or too lose, give enough force to shoot but not difficult for kids to use.Overall, it’s very fun for the kids and also us adults too.Good toys of toy quality."
"Love the game and how it was tweaked to match the giant size. There’s only 3 pieces instead of four. It definitely does not affect the fun. Probably makes it quicker to win to play more games. It’s plastic so it’s easy to clean. And won’t hurt it if it gets wet. The pieces are not the quickest to put together but are sturdy and lightweight.Overall I am very happy with the money I spent."
"Great game! So easy to play"
"I purchased these for our two granddaughters. They are very cool. The pieces are oversized and detailed. They granddaughters were very excited."
"Overall, this is very fun! It is pretty easy to set up basically you lay the blanket part flat on your floor and snap together the large game pieces. For people that are used to playing the original board game, this one is slightly different. There are three pieces for each player instead of four. There are also a few differences between the rules and gameplay. However, you can always institute house rules and play it just like you do the board game. This is what we usually do so my pre-schooler don't have to try to figure out the differences between the two games.  My elementary-aged kid loves the different shortcut rules on this game board!Since the board is so large, it provides a little bit more movement since often you have to get up to walk around to the other side of the board to move pieces. This is a definite plus for children with a lot of energy!The sturdiness of this is quite questionable, which is a little disappointing considering that this is a child's game. The map part which is the game board is pretty thin and puckers pretty easily if children were to crawl a cross it often it could easily tear or rip.  A minus for children with a lot of energy.  It's thinner than a typical reusable tablecloth. However, it's thicker than the ones you get at a dollar store. I am very nervous when my dog tries to walk across it, Which if we were to play in the middle of the living room floor often cannot be avoided. We have rug on our floor which means the surface underneath it is not solid which would make it even easier for holes to be punctured or dog nails to go through it. I wish the game board was a little more sturdy. Also, when I was putting together the pieces, it was hard to get a few of the pieces to snap completely together. This left us small gap at the top of each game piece. We were still able to use each; however, it did detract from the overall quality.Overall, I""m happy and this provides some family fun that gives us a bit more movement than a table top game.  I wish the quality was higher."
"My 5 and 8 year old sons loves playing this game. Seems like they loved it more than the original board game because this one is more interactive.. so instead of sitting around a game they’re actually able to stand up and move around. I would definitely recommend this!!"
"I love monopoly! I bought the giant game edition because I wanted the 4 giant token pieces (car, hat, shoe and dog) for scavenger hunt purposes. I am on a conference committee and the destination for the annual conference was Atlantic City, NJ.  What better game to play then monopoly.  I was able to make poster size property pieces and incorporate the 4 giant token pieces around the conference center. We created monopoly trivia questions that sent attendees on a scavenger hunt to find the property, utility or token piece.  It went over well, mission accomplished."
"This was ordered because we loved playing the original Sorry game back in the day. It looks just like the original game, only much larger. The plastic game ""board"" is more like a thick plastic sheet you put on the floor and ready to use. The spinner is easily popped together. Now for the game pieces.... UGHHHH! The game pieces are a great size, easy to grab and move. Unfortunately they don't come assembled and where it seems it should be easy to pop 2 pieces of plastic together per pawn, the plastic is warped and holes don't align and they literally took forever to put together, over half hr just to pop these together. The whole game is brightly colored and a fun idea, but the game pieces need better construction and durability. Fun for people of all ages and not a bad price point."
"Awesome for outdoor functions!! Great value for the money!! Very easy to learn and play!! Kids absolutely love it!!"
"The game is large, the kids were a little cramped if they ended up beside each other but the gameplay is fun. Was about 20 minutes total."
"The parts were difficult to put together but once done all was fine"
"We had a blast playing this during the summer break. It is fun for ages 6 and up."
"The Original The Floor is Lava! Game by Endless Games is a hit with both kids and adults! It’s interactive, energetic, and encourages creativity as players jump from tile to tile to avoid the “lava.” The setup is simple, and it’s perfect for family game nights, parties, or just a fun activity to get everyone moving.The game promotes teamwork, coordination, and a lot of laughter. The tiles are sturdy and vibrant, making them easy to use and durable for repeated play. Whether for indoors or outdoors, this game is an absolute blast. Highly recommend for hours of fun and excitement!"
"This game is perfect for kids! Any age kid honestly! My daughter loves playing with her friends!!!"
"While game was in effect one of players little 2-3 years old brother  joined in the fun- uninvited and happily 95.5% of the stepped on the correct colors. Total fun!!"
"While the game itself seems very fun for a 6 year old, the stepping pieces aren't big enough for larger feet and they are a very flimsy flannel.  I'm not sure how to make them stronger because laminating would make them too slippery?  It seems like the game should just have pieces make of sturdier thicker flannel that is larger."
"My daughter is obsessed with “the floor is lava” and I had no idea they actually made a game for it. Love it, would recommend"
"The game looked like it had been returned, nothing in bags and one of the cards was missing.  My grandson loved the game so I didn’t want to take from him to return it. Loved the game but a little disappointed that it did not appear new."
"I was impressed with how quickly the game I bought for my daughter's birthday was delivered! It arrived sooner than expected, in perfect condition, and made her very happy on her special day. The speed of delivery made all the difference. Very satisfied with the shopping experience!"
"Lovely game for Christmas"

I knew the moment I saw my buddy pull this game out at a cookout that I would love it, and I was not disappointed when I actually got to play. I love ping pong and other non-traditional games so this fit perfectly into my lane.I appreciate that it is a self-contained game, as well. The paddles, balls and even the net fit inside the board so that it is super portable. I will now take this with us if I even think anyone will be willing to play.We took this to a local lake beach and had everyone (not exaggerating) asking us about what this game was. We even had some other attendees ask if they could play while me and my friends were taking a break. This game is such a good ice breaker at outdoor events. It gives the people that don't want to play something to watch\talk about too! We have a church event coming up and I can't wait to bring Paddlesmash out and get people playing.Our friend group is starting to introduce our kids into the mix by pairing them with an adult partner. We have 8 year olds and up getting started and it's only making the game more approachable. The biggest hurdle for the kids is paddle control and net awareness. They see us playing at a higher level and really want to get in on the action.Paddlesmash has a lifetime warranty that can be activated as soon as you open it up, and it's super easy to do. The paddles are pretty sturdy, but they can break if you play as extremely as we do. This is easily overcome by the warranty.I'm hooked on this game for life. My only problem now is finding people that want to play as much as I do!"
"Really fun game... easy to play and you can do it in a small space... Highly recommend!"

Paddle Smash…thank you.. you’ve done it.. I have been searching my whole life for a game this fun and I don’t even play pickle ball.1st The design is amazing.  Easy 1 minute setup and everything fits inside the compact hardshell case.  Even if you only have time to play 1 game.. the quick set up is worth it!!2nd The game is so much fun!  The paddles give you more reach and the net prevents dirty low hits making it 100x better than spikeball. It’s the perfect balance of skill and hustle.  Once you get the hang of it you can make some awesome saves and spikes that get the people going!!3rd Value.  Only $200 for this much fun and lifetime warranty is worth every penny.  You might struggle to buy 4 really good pickle ball paddles for under 200$.4th customer support.  When I broke a paddle after playing hard for weeks I sent one email and they sent a new one right away no questions asked (other than my shipping address lol).  Their customer support is responsive and very top notch!If you’re on the edge just buy it!  You won’t regret it and it may change your life.  I get invited to everything now because I have paddle smash! It always stays in the truck."
"this is such a fun game. my family loves it! it is easy to take places, because of the case it comes in. the way it folds up is so clever! i recommend this!!!"
"I was hesitant at first to spend almost $200 on a ""toy"" to take to the beach for my family - ranging in age from 14 to 68 years old.  I considered it for a week or so before deciding to take a chance and order it.  I'm so glad that I did.  Please take the instructions to heart - it WILL take around 10 to 15 minutes before you will get the hang of how it works, but once you do - it's so much fun!  My first reaction when it arrived was how heavy it was - sturdy for sure.  It sets up quickly and easily.  Then - just be patient with yourself and keep practicing - don't give up until you've given it at least 30 minutes to sink in.  My kids are grown with older kids of their own, and when we left the beach, both my son and daughter wanted to take it home with them.  My daughter ended up with it, but decided her brother should also have one, so she had one sent to him!  I think that says a lot about how much fun and interaction you can have with this set.  It really isn't a toy - it's extremely well made and durable.  My family recommends it and now we can't wait to take it back to the beach next year - I can already imagine how tough the competition is going to be with them having an entire year to practice!  If you're on the fence - go for it!"
"Super fun game and easy to travel with! It takes some practice so you have to be willing to be patient and get the hang of it but we’re enjoying it."
"This game is not family friendly.  We are all huge pickleball players and none of us could play this game.We tried to play with some 12 yr olds who play many other sports and they couldn’t play it either.The paddles are cheap and one was chipped. You have to watch a video for instructions on how to play only the video is really just an advertisement and very confusing.  We returned this game."

I debated a long time over this purchase. I have been on a hunt for an active game that my four kids (ages 10-15, with 3 boys and only 1 girl) could play and would enjoy enough to keep at it to get truly good. I have tried so many outdoor/basement games and the boys usually enjoy them but the girl never gets hooked and this breaks up the four players needed (spikeball, fooseball, air hockey, cross net etc). I finally gave this a try as it seemed like something even I would actually enjoy playing with my kids as well. (And there are 2 and 3 player versions so you don’t HAVE to have four players always). We have had the game 1.5 weeks and already they have spent endless hours playing this! I couldn’t be more thrilled!It took us longer than 5 min to get the hang of it (and I honestly questioned my decision to get this game after the first evening that we tried it). But everyone was quite motivated to stick with it. And it did begin to click just like they promised. And then it just becomes addicting!We have only played this in our basement so far, as it has been super hot outside. But I can’t wait for cooler weather as I think it will be even more fun outside! Though honestly, it has been great getting the hang of it inside.I am so glad that I took a chance on this game and that I didn’t let the price tag stop me. It seems very well made. And I love how portable it is! Five stars!"
"Well made!  So much fun!  Highly recommend!"
"Lots of fun for four or even two players. Think of bump, set, spike! Net, base, and paddles are all high quality. We've got three teenage boys. This is our new favorite game!"
"Terrific fun and very entertaining.  Not as easy as it looks - needs practice but well worth it. Stores nicely."
"I do like this game but this product was questionable because the piping for the stand shows signs of stress each and every time we set it up or change the game. I did see one that was $40 more I feel like I should have got it because the stand was made of metal this was low grade plastic but the appearance was very attractive for the kids it was easy to set up but I don't expect this to last more than a few months. Value for money was okay"
"The axes stick nicely and it is very sturdy"
"This is really awesome but unfortunately the connectors came broken. They are not a more pliable plastic and  it could have been prevented had it been packaged into another box with some bubbles."
"It looks great, and set up was easy and fun. However make sure you have a bag or plastic tote to keep it in while not in use. It came with a bag for the darts and axes, but nothing for the target, and the cardboard box it came in will not do the trick."
"Got it for the birthday gift of my son, he loves it. Still holding great."
"This game was a very big hit during the graduation party. Everybody loved it. It was super great. It’s adorable and it was well worth the money."
"Package came with missing instructions and missing parts. I can only use it for axe throwing. Items are all made of plastic and very cheap. The whole item is very flimsy. Not worth the price at all."
"I bought this to take camping but have enjoyed it at family gatherings. My 10 year old grandson loves it. I like that it can be used with both darts and axes. It is made of lightweight materials so it’s easy to take anywhere."
"Easy to put together and get down to having fun. Stands up to moving and playing with the kids."
"The kids loved this well made product"
"Everyone enjoyed this over the summer - young and old :-)"
"Good game for outside this summer well made."
"This is a really fun game, but the frame  is made of plastic and I don't expect it to last long.  Who  knows, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised!"
"This was purchased as a gag gift for when my husband can’t make it to the range. It had my husband and son playing for hours. It is light weight and maybe a little flimsy, but still sturdy enough to be used for hours. Fun for the whole family."
"I bought this to keep me and my 9yo busy for the rest of the summer. Ordered last night arrived early this AM. He has been playing with it all day. Assembly was easy and it works as it was described to. ONE THING TO NOTE: If you watch the product video, the motor has a little pin like object to attach the rotating hands. Mine did not have one.It rotates like is should though. I'm not sure if that was a design update? Just something to note, so if your doesn't have it, know it still works! PVC is sturdy enough, could it be sturdier, yes. But it does the job."
"This game is really fun, just poorly constructed. Be sure to do a trial assembly a day or two before you plan to use the game in case you need to run to the hardware store. The game was sent with the wrong parts so we had to purchase a pipe joiner separately in order to complete assembly. On top of that the toy guns both broke within the first hour of the day, but by holding the top of the slide could still be used more or less. While the game lasted, it was a big hit, it’s just poorly made and not very durable."
"Grandson has had lots of fun. His other grandfather does target shooting and has even played with him. Does take up some room"
"This is really fun, but the plastic used for the base is thin and brittle. It we get three days out of it, I will be amazed. I was able to order additional balls."
"Hours of fun for all ages.  Easy to put together."
"This item was missing the main part to hold it all together and another part.I am very disappointed with this product. It was purchased for a Fall festival and could not be used at all."
"My grandson loves his gift. He opened and played with it right away! It’s easy to assemble, has a good weight, and his ability to perform the different speeds are great. It’s good for his age group. I’d recommend getting, the quality has meet my standards."
"I ordered it for gifting to 5 year old, but learned the kid has it already and enjoy a lot playing with it."
"it was an amazing gift but the part was canceled"
"It was good idea for a birthday giftGood product. Children had a lot of fun"
"This is a great idea. You get what you pay for, it's priced low and the material is definitely cheap. Not durable. It's fun for the kids while it lasts."
"My Mom and I put it together while sitting on the couch lol but can totally been done solo in 5min.The adults took over before the boys got a hold of it 😩🤣🤣.Simple, yet Super fun and lightweight; easy to configure and load the guns."
"A very significant purchase and very highly regarded / appreciated! experienced seller A++++"
"This was a great gift for grandma’s house for the younger grands kids!!!♥️♥️♥️There are 3 young boys who absolutely love playing with this shooting game. They have more fun shooting at each other than the targets, but boys will be boys and with the balls being foam, Grandma doesn’t  have to worry about injuries with these toys. Setting up the target was a breeze and they were quickly into competition to who could get more targets. The use and operation of the pump action gun is easy enough for the even the 3 yo to operate. I give this a five star rating because of the value for the money compared to what is currently on the local market and durability of the toys. It has been about a month and they are still holding up well under the constant use of kids.  Super fun & definitely recommended!!!!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Fun, easy to put together and nice and sturdy"
"Love this item, definitely one of my favorite summer games. Great fun for the yard.  Value for money. Seller sent quickly and packaging was good."
"I purchased this for my son’s 8th birthday. We had a pool party and the kids really enjoyed playing with it. Only downside is that they couldn’t figure out how the release the rings from the bottom. Once they were shown we had no more problems."
"This was definitely worth it easy to put together my son did it alone and they just love it. Definitely a good buy."
"Who could say anything negative about a jumbo connect four? This is used in our wine tasting room and have yet to have a complaint. Took less than 10 minutes to put it together and it is used inside and outside through wind, sun, and sat outside for a couple of rain storms. I appreciate the hooks on the toy itself that stores the rings making clean up and storing a breeze!"
"Great product for the price. Ability to adjust the height was a plus."
"Bought this for a backyard gathering and it provided fun play for adults and kids alike. It's sturdy and height adjustable."
"Good Quality, HUGE in person, good part of new collection would like to see more retro decks or variety in Huge Decks!"
"Love the cards but it is really hard to shuffle the cars as they are big lol but very easy to use we play family game night every week now"
"The huge size is a fun twist to this traditional card game.  The size is definitely harder to handle, which is what makes it so fun.  Very young kids may find it more frustrating than amusing though.I first purchased these cards for the kids at my church to play with before service starts.  It was one of the most popular things we had out.  I’ve since picked up a few sets as gifts.  Everyone has liked them so much, that I finally bought one for our household."
"Obviously hard to shuffle,  but good quality cards, and fun with lots of people."
"These cards are so big and fun. I love these cards"
"I bought this for a senior care center. They are huge cards and the box is a little heavy, but I think they will enjoy this game since almost anyone is going to be able to see the cards easily."
"I love the size I have the very mini small ones and had to have these also. we play uno alot  and these ones have become very popular  in the house . Durability  is great . Thicker then expected.  Color is bright and clear . These were absolutely perfect the price is affordable.  Not gna lie hard to shuffle but still makes it fun . They won't disappoint!"
"These were the life of the party on my friends beach trip! We had such an awesome time in the summer using these! I think they could be used for all ages, and the quality of the cards are no different than the smaller cards I believe. This is Fun for family and friends and everything in between! It is bulky so I will say if you’re traveling, make sure you have a bag that’s perfect for it! My one small comment is that I do wish they made these giant Uno cards waterproof for those of us that want to use it at the beach."
"Huge cards, great quality"
"This is hilarious! I was expecting jumbo playing cards but I wasn't expecting them to be the jumboest of jumbos. Holding the deck is like holding a book and just as heavy! We laughed so much. You should have seen us double-teaming on shuffling as we each held one half of the deck and tried to time getting them to fall into each other. Make sure you have a big table to play on cause they are gigantic. Actual Dinosaurs could play with these. Made my day. I love it!"
"This was a great purchase! The price lines up with the quality. We played ping pong all winter, here in Wisconsin to keep the blues away.The table was very easy to install and doesn’t leave marks when you move it. It folds away but we’ve left it up to use as a table. It doesn’t look cheap, so it works as a full time piece of furniture.***Be aware, this is not a full sized ping pong table and it says so in the description. It can be a challenge to adjust to the smaller size, but I like the challenge. We can now play pretty competitively in our basement and didn’t have to sacrifice the space required for a full sized table."
"There is everything to love about this table. It was small enough to fit perfectly in our loft, but big enough to be fun to play on; it is sturdy but sets up as easily as a folding table; and it is lightweight so you can transport it, if you want, or tuck it into a closet or under a bed. This is one of my favorite purchases because of the high fun to money ratio. I can have a ton of fun as often as I want for very little money."
"Opened the box and was playing several minutes later. Great quality product, from the table to the paddles. I was looking for something I didn't have to put together and this was ideal, and it's not terribly heavy either. There was a small dent on the metal side, but not noticeable enough to be annoyed about. I also didn't mind that it's 6 feet vs competitive tables, because it's nice to be closer to hear and to see (for those of us with crappy vision without glasses) I was able to do all the aggressive moves I do on larger tables. A+ product, we are having so much fun, and sweating from the exercise!"
"Delivered in 2 days ... yessss!  I've missed Amazon's 2-day prime shipping since March. Thank you seller and courier!  Purchased this table for quick recreation so not expecting much.  It's small enough to fit in an apartment. That's a deciding factor for me. But it only comes in red, that's a big minus. It can be an eyesore if it doesn't match the room.  And I think red's too bright a color for the eyes to keep track of the little ping pong ball. It comes with a net, a pair of rackets and 4 ping pong balls.  I got rid of the rackets and balls, they don't feel right. The table is made of thin plywood.  It absorbs a bit of the ball's bounce so it it takes more effort on the players.  Quite noisy too.  I'm considering installing foam underneath for noise reduction.  The frame and legs are made of aluminum that would bend and dent easily so be careful setting up or storing. There are little dimples on the sides of the table that I have received.  Must be from shipping and handling.  It's poorly packaged.  It's only in a thin bubble wrap with small foams at each corner enclosed in a not-so-snug box. Imagine it being tossed in the facilities and into trucks then to you.  That's the first thing I checked, dents. But the folding bars and legs are ok, just little dents on the frame that will not affect the table's use.  I'm not disappointed with it but I cannot say I am pleased.  The important thing for me is to be able to move my family away from our dining table and into this new ping pong table instead. They seem to like it and I am able to reclaim my dining table so I'm liking it too. I think it's expensive so good thing that it's offered to be paid in installment interest free.  That was another deciding factor for me."
"Bought for my son’s birthday. Was a little worried about other reviews talking about damage during shipping, but our came in great condition.Quick and easy set up. Sturdy and a nice midsize table for smaller spaces. We really like how portable it is to move from various locations. Very happy with the purchase!"
"Easy to assemble. Sturdy and very east to fold and out away.  Great inexpensive option if you are looking to have some fun.  Only recommendation. Balls are a bit heavy so the bounce is a bit off.  Purchased some colored balls and they are lighter and seem to connect with the paddles and table better.  Overall highly recommend. Exactly as advertised."
"We just used this table for the first time. It is super easy to set up, and it is small enough that we could set it up on the patio. The grandkids loved it, and thankfully let me have a turn. It might be a little small to try to play 2 vs 2 without whacking into each other, but for 2 people it's perfect. Table arrived in good shape and is quite portable. Super fun!"
"Our whole family - three generations - are having a blast playing on it. It is sturdy and well-made, yet portable and easy to set up, take down and store. The materials are high quality and pleasing to the eye and touch. I like how the corners are smooth and padded. The paddles, balls and net that come with the set make it a complete package with everything you need to start playing. It’s a great value and I’m certain our family and friends will enjoy it for many years to come."
"Was very pleased with quality of this table, no issues out of the box and easy to set up. Surprisingly sturdy for the price, and the included paddles and balls were good enough quality for us that I didn't bother buying  anything else. If you're used to playing on a full sized table, it takes some getting used to – also when the ball hits the metal frame edges it does tend to bounce wildly and unpredictably. When it works in your favour though it's good for a laugh. Because we have a smaller rec room area to put this in, it was a better fit for us, so coupled with the lower price those minor issues were an easy trade off. Folds up nicely with a handle on the case to bring it with you if the need arises. Highly recommend for those with a bit less room or who might be on a budget."
"No assembly needed. Very easy and portable. Adjustable legs. Awesome fun and the kids love it."
"Bought these for our daughter‚Äôs birthday party since we have a big backyard to keep the kids occupied. Everyone loved em. Great way to unwind and relax after long day without having to think. Would buy again. And the felt hasn‚Äôt disappoint. The balls still stick!"
"I bought this package for a family vacation - enough for four people to play! Also, the velcro material on the balls wears out over time, so the extra balls in the box were great for swapping out."
"This is an easy activity to pull out. We bring it camping and enjoy it. This is our second set."
"Super fun, but balls break way too easily. Will need extra balls"
"My kids love playing with these. What‚Äôs great is that my 3 year old can also partake and feel included. I went with the four pack in case they have friends over etc. Velcro is great and you have plenty of balls in case one or two get lost. Love the sack it comes with to keep all of it together. The size is perfect for little to big hands, so the age range is easily 3 and up. Super durable and extremely easy to use."
"All my grandkids love playing this from 4 years to 13 years"
"A ball lasts maybe 3 hours if play. They start to fall apart after that. You better buy the 4 pack"
"A good game to play with your kids to teach them how to catch without the frustration! Also they can play with it by themselves too!"
"Super fun to play with. The velcro/ball attachment is quite strong, sometimes it's a little hard to rip it off the board, but I see that as a good thing."
"The plastic plate on both catchers cracked during first use. Wasn‚Äôt even throwing the ball hard."
"Purchased for the grandchildren, some who were too young to catch a ball with a mitt.  Everyone liked them"
"Simple but great purchase"
"Purchased for grandchildren..ages 5&7 yrs.Kids enjoyed playing. Age appropriate."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I got this for the backyard for summer, but it has also been a GREAT indoor toy as well! My 19 month old has started to want to throw toys, so when she does we just re-direct her to this toy. It's wonderful because it has the sticky target on one side and bean bag toss on the other, so I can switch it up when she gets tired of one.The velcro on the balls holds great, they will even stick if they bounce off of a hard floor, and depending on the fabric can stick to her clothes which she finds hilarious. I also appreciate the bright colors of the balls so you can easily find them.The bean bags are the perfect size and weight for little hands. You just lay the triangle on its side and it turns into a ramp for bean bag toss.The quality has been great and has held up against my toddler. It is very lightweight and easy to pack, and comes with stakes to hold it down outside. I only wish it came with a drawstring bag to store the balls and bean bags. Overall, a great indoor/outdoor toy and would make a great gift."
"Bought for a 3 yr old...but entertaining for others as well. Used indoors on a Rainey day. Velco balls really do stick nicely to bullseye and bean bags are small and durable. Colors bright., Really happy with purchase"
"Cute game for little ones to play at anytime, and can be used indoors and outdoors. The balls stick great and easily to the target number side and they and stay once stuck on! The bean bags are a perfect size for little hands. It is easy to fold up flat and put away (I have not coiled it back up they way it came). My girls have a great time playing with it, keeps them busy for a nice amount of time. My once dislike is that the velcro that keeps it in its playing position is a bit flimsy and I can see it not lasting very long."
"My daughter and her cousins love to play with this at our cabin when it’s too cold to swim. We’ve also used it at birthday parties. It’s super cute."
"Easy to assemble and fun to use for toddlers. Even they can put it together, with a little guidance.Enjoy with littles, and even big kids like it!"
"This game is very interactive but very flimsy. Works better inside than outside. The velcro balls are small and easy for kids to put in their mouths. Not recommended for teething toddlers."
"Not so easy to fold, also wish it came with carrying case. For the price, a very good value."
"Easy to assemble"
"Very fun! But very hard to land all the tricks! Overall great and fun!"
"Just getting started in the pop darts realm. Watch the youtube videos on how to throw. Getting better everyday. Fun with friends. You Definity need a hard surface that is solid. The darts stick strong and can pick up a board or similar light weight item when retrieving."
"Super simple, super fun game. Keeps teen boys entertained for hours."
"It literally has been a game changer at the office lol, super fun"
"It’s fun to play and a good gift. I like how it stores together in one bag. Easy to travel with."
"I have back problems so when my family plays things like cornhole or does axe throwing etc. I can't really participate. I came across Popdarts and loved the idea. Kinda like a save indoor lawndarts. I decided to buy a set so there would be a game I could play too and I'm very glad I did. You can play the game on many surfaces and from a sitting or standing position. The ""darts"" are light and I can't imagine them damaging anything so using them on, say, your car hood should be no problem. The darts are light without feeling cheap.If I had one downside I'd say the price tag is a little heafty but I would still absolutely recommend this item. Fun game, give it a try."
"love them"
"Once you learn how to throw these things it’s a very fun game and worth buying.  If you are worried about how good the suction will be, DONT.  These things STICK and are very flexible."
"I first stumbled upon PopDarts at a friend‚Äôs house after a few drinks. It started as a casual game but quickly became as competitive as the Hunger Games (minus the deadly weapons, of course). You don‚Äôt need to be a pro to play‚Äîtrust me, my technique was questionable at best‚Äîbut somehow, I was landing bullseyes like a dart-throwing ninja.The beauty of this game? It‚Äôs so portable! You can stuff it in your bag for your next trip and unleash the suction cup fury anywhere with a flat surface. Hotel rooms? Check. Airbnb living rooms? Yep. Poolside in the summer? Absolutely. Just watch out‚Äîyour kids will hijack it for hours, and you‚Äôll only get it back if you bribe them.Now, the price. Yes, they are a bit on the expensive side for what essentially amounts to glorified sticky darts. But hey, these things are practically indestructible, and once you‚Äôve made the investment, you‚Äôll be PopDarting your way through every family gathering, vacation, and dull moment. Highly recommended for all ages (and all levels of competitiveness)."
"We bought this because it looked like a lot of fun for a family, which it is!  But now our son uses it in his classroom, as well!  It is entertaining for teenagers, and keeps them interested!  We used a giant white board as the target!"
"I recently purchased the Popdarts Pro Pack game set and I have to say, it's been a blast! The set comes with everything you need to get started, darts, and instructions. The darts are perfectly balanced for accurate throws.One of the things I love about this game is how easy it is to set up and play. You can get started within minutes and it's great fun for all ages. The darts stick really well and the scoring system is clear and easy to understand.The game is compact and easy to store, so it's perfect for taking with you on the go or setting up in a smaller space.Overall, I would highly recommend the Popdarts Pro Pack game set to anyone who is looking for a fun and easy-to-play game that provides hours of entertainment. It's well-made, versatile, and a great value for the price. Five stars all the way!"
"I bought these for a few parties, people love them. They durable, easy to wash, easy to use and easy to stick. The orange target had the occasional round where it would un-stick itself but we would stick it back down and life was good. would definitely recommend for kids and adults alike."
"Quality"
"Love these darts. Played them at a resort and had to get them amazon had them the set I ordered is jest the board had to ordered the darts separately but we'll worth it it's also a great gift to give."
"I was a little skeptical about the pricing.  It seemed like a lot for some rubber.  The darts are well made.  They stick well when thrown correctly.  I think the price is worth the fun.It can take a little bit of practice to learn the technique so that the dart lands suction side down, but it doesn't take too long to get.  I believe the pop dart people have a video on their site discussing throwing techniques.The game itself is good fun.  Playing on a glass table top is the best.  I think this will play well for at least anyone 12 and up, perhaps younger if they have decent motor control.I would recommend the double sided ""pro"" target.  The extra excitement when someone actually lands one on it is worth it.  It also means that no one is ever really ""out"" of a game, they can always come back fast."
"We play this on our kitchen island in the evening with a few beverages near... A non thinking game that can be played with all ages and gets you up off the chair and moving around.  Lots of fun and laughs - we have played many times and the darts remain with suction power."
"Highly recommend this game. It was a hit since we bought it just before Christmas. It is a quick and easy game to be able to take to others houses. It takes a little while to get the hang of throwing the darts. But it makes for a fun round with the other play. Our toddler also loves the game and finds it very entertaining."
"This instantly became a great hit at our game party nights. Super simple to set up, if not a little annoying at first because it can be tough to get the throwing motion correct to land consistent shots. Once you're used to it, it becomes a wonderfully competitive game."
"This product can kill hours, its great fun"
"this is my second purchase of pop darts because we loved the first purchase so much.  switched up the colors with this one though so we can have more teams if we want. we played this forever in the kitchen and couldn‚Äôt wait to play again. you can play almost any where !! use a window ! use a patio door ! buy the platform thing that they also sell !  so many options whether inside or outside and once you throw a few and they stick to things you‚Äôll just wanna keep on throwing them.  their site shows techniques for throws.  just check out pop darts.  do it."
"What's not to love about exercising - EVERYTHING!  But these beautifully made exercise bands make working a routine so flawless and fun.  They are of high quality and I love the bright colors to easily identify their different strengths.  I highly recommended this product.  Easy ordering and delivery too!"
"these bands are well built, work well and were not overpriced."
"Bands seem reasonable with durable straps. Grips could be a little bit better quality and design. Other than the grips being under whelming, but good for the price, the bands stretch as they should."
"Great way to stay fit while traveling abroad. Easy to change weight, good grip, durable resistance"
"So, I chose the set that altogether gets you about 250 lbs. of resistance because I can't afford a good rowing machine. Come to find out that the 250 lbs. of resistance with this set is still easy to row with but provides enough satisfaction that you are getting a tremendous workout. I love it! I don't have an actual tool to test the accuracy of each cord, but if they are all accurate... then I found a splendid way to row for less!Of course, there are other exercises to use these with so there's that as well! I will definitely consider the 300 lbs. version at a later time because hey, I work with many patients at my hospital job so the more weight I can lift/push/pull the better.Overall, I say go for it!"
"I purchase these bands when I was going for therapy for my shoulder and I still use them to this day. It’s a great recovery workout and I highly recommend getting these for the value quality and durability of the item is well worth it."
"Easy to use, change bands, use with door."
"This set up is good. Clearly marked to see whats what. It's working just fine for my physical therapy exercises. If I had to add anything to this set it would be a second pair of handles ."
"Just what I needed and more. Everything is included and works extremely well for workouts at home."
"It is literally not worth the price 99 dhs? The quality is very bad and  it is not same in description I received generic tools and the handles are not good they seem to cut off in first usage. Do not buy it . I request for refund"
"I am very happy with these resistance bands! I purchased these in addition to another set I already had, allowing me to have different setups prepared around the room, saving time on changing bands for different exercises.For me, these bands work better than going to the gym, which comes with an expensive monthly fee, travel time and costs, lack of natural light, loud and annoying music, and often having to queue to use the equipment.I leave them on the floor in my room so they are easy to pick up. This allows me to take half-hour pauses between reps, something not achievable at the gym. If you're at home or work from home, you can do some reps every hour during the day.In terms of results, I've noticed improved muscle definition in about 3-4 weeks. I'm sure the best results come with a good diet, which I'm still working on. I've never seen such improvements from going to the gym, probably because I couldn't maintain the routine long enough and couldn't exercise on the spot at any time of the day without traveling, etc. I also noted that resistance bands are a lot more protective for my joints and lower back, which allows me to exercise for longer.I've researched quite a bit on the pros and cons of resistance bands vs. constant weight. Based on my experience, if you have the correct diet and consistency in working out, you can achieve 'the six-pack body' with resistance bands alone, as long as you keep adding extra bands over time as you progress. If you're aiming for professional bodybuilding competitions, you will probably need to work out with classical weights as well.I'm very pleased with this additional purchase and regret not trying resistance bands earlier in life. It has been a game changer for me.I've shared this whole story with the other seller from whom I purchased my initial set of resistance bands."
"40lbs cable came with tears on the ends. Didn’t see it until I used it and the cable snapped almost instantly."
"I bought these when I realized that I needed something quick and easy to use and workout now and then and these bands have not disappointed.They are reasonably durable and thick and as far as I can tell no production defects on my set.I've seen a few people complain about missing a band in their set but I received the full set so I have nothing to complain about."
"These resistance bands are fantastic! The quality is top-notch, and they offer a great stretch without any issues. I’ve really put them through the ringer, and they’ve held up perfectly. They’ve been incredibly helpful for my workouts and specific movements. Highly recommend for anyone looking for durable and effective bands."
"This is our second time ordering these. The first round lasted about a year of heavy heavy use before they started snapping & breaking on us. These are half the cost of what you would pay at the big box gyms, so I expect that. My husband, kids & I all use these for a variety of activity, so as long as you know these do have a shelf life and you’ll have to replace them with heavy use, they’re a great value add to your at home workout regimen."
"These bands are so strong and work really well you want to chnge up the weights for bands, changing up the workout!!"
"Excellent product, durable, highly recommend"
"These bands are great.  The different strengths are very helpful in assisting me to obtain my goals."
"Good quality."
"I had a bicep tendon reconstruction surgery and wanted to go back to doing assisted pullups at home without any fancy gym equipment. These bands offered just that. I am now using the second to last band for 10 reps and hopefully in a few weeks I won't be needing them at all for my training."
"Great value, especially on discount!"
"The bands are not 100% like the pictures, the only difference is that bands are not branded, after 1 week trial the quality is good."
"Loved the quality of these bands, especially for the price. They don’t slide down even when sweaty. The resistance have stayed even after multiple use for over 2 months."
"The quality is 10× better than I'd imagine. I was worried about breakage when in use but I'm certain that they're secured. No slip, easy to use, and can't wait to upgrade to stronger band. I was even reached out to make sure I'm happy about the bands and I am!"
"Great product good price the quality is great!"
"They came with a pouch to store them in.  Slight smell but that will dissipate over time.  Very comfortable to use.  I used them on my bare skin and they did not pinch or irritate.  I also have bigger legs (2-3X) and they were comfortable sitting above the knees.  They did not roll down nor did I struggle to put them on."
"Nice bands"
"Ordered Renoji Resistance exercise bands and have been using then for about a month: There are well made, wide and have not curled or cut into my large upper leg. The 3 different resistant level bands provided is a nice touch, but I use the black band (most resistance)."
"I was not expecting so much resistance in these bands! The 3 bands gradually increase from easy to difficult. I would say the one with least resistance (easier one) is a band that most people could use. The band with the most resistance is challenging! However, it gives me motivation to work up to that band! Also love the material on these. They are super comfortable and nothing like those rubber bands that pull your leg hair."
"Love the fun colors. They work great"
"Good quality."
"Very poor supposed resistance bands that offer no / little resistance"
"Well, buckle up, because this is going to be a resistance-band review like no other!First off, let's talk about the packaging. These bands come in a cute little pouch that's perfect for taking with you on-the-go. It's like a little bag of tricks that can turn any location into a full-body workout zone. Beach? Check. Office? Check. Grandma's house? Check (but maybe wait until after dinner).Now, onto the bands themselves. These babies have some serious stretch to them, which means they're perfect for women of all shapes and sizes. Whether you're a petite powerhouse or a curvy queen, these bands will help you feel the burn in all the right places.But the real question is: are they fun? Well, let me tell you, I had a blast using these bands. I may have accidentally flung one across the room and hit my cat (sorry, Mittens), but that's just a sign of how much fun I was having.In all seriousness though, these bands are great. They're durable, easy to use, and they come in three different resistance levels so you can switch things up as you get stronger. Plus, they're a heck of a lot cheaper than a gym membership, so you can save your money for more important things, like a lifetime supply of chocolate.So if you're looking for a fun and effective way to get your sweat on, these resistance bands are definitely worth checking out. Just maybe keep them away from your pets."
"I love the color I boughtLove the variety of resistances. I started with the middle one, the 2 before were too easy for me. Feels well made and hasn't snapped on me. To be fair I just bought it and have used it a few times. No smell when I opened the packaging. Doesn't slip, make sure you wear leggings or some layer and do not use on bare skin unless you want to lose some hair lol.Love the pouch it came with as well"
"I bought these to use with one of my elderly clients. I find them very easy to use, well made, stretchable, versatile, and just the right size. They don't pinch and are comfortable when using."
"For the price I got them at I was skeptical, but after using them these held up extremely well!! The material felt strong and the colors were pretty. The only reason I give it a 4 is because the carrying bag ripped :( Still very worth the price"
"Great for simple workout or a not so simple workout"
"Started using bands. Love the colors. Great resistance. First use is obviously super tight, but it does tend to lose a little bit after first few uses. We will see how they last."
"These looked great and I was excited. First time I tried them they roll down and I feel like I'm getting bruises. It is extremely painful with a rolled rubber band to do squats.I only used the medium, cannot imagine these in the heavy and x heavy. My thighs are strong but a little meaty so it dug in ajwn rolled up many inches. Could barely complete 10 min of glute exersizes.Not durable enough, cheaply made. Guess i need tp spend a little more on these in thr future.Followed the instructions, these are not easy to use as they just aren't really what you need for glute exercise. Spend more than this.Update. I use these for my arm workouts and revised the rating from 1 star to 3 stars. I found a use."
"Bands look and feel great but the bag to store them in came with a broken clip. Bought these for my 9 year old daughters dance class (conditioning) and she loves the colors!"
"These work well. They are compact and come in a convenient carrying case. They stay in place."
"Love the bright colours and the quality is great.  Comes with a little bag to store them to.Overall, love them."
"I like them a lot . And the price is affordable. I love that they came with the little bag to put them inside ."
"Very good Products and the strengh variation is super."
"After a few months one of the bands broke, I tied it and figured it was just a bad band, then 2 more broke and now time has passed where I cannot return and no way to contact seller, no phone, email nothing of their selling site. Avoid this product. Waste of 15$UPDATE: They reached out to me and gave me full refund, thanks you!"
"I think these are the best band resistance. Product I have ever bought they are very solid and they come with different strengths. And the kit is amazing it includes everything you need and what I like about it That price is affordable. Itâ€™s not so expensive for the quality you receive. I recommend buying it."
"These are a really good quality.  Everything is holding really well and give a good workout.  + The bag is easy to carry and it's all rather compactable.  They work well for their intended purpose.  They are comfortable to use and for the price, are overall very good to use."
"Durable and very handy for home workouts. Easy to use and switch between workouts."
"This is a great set of bands! Iâ€™m learning how to use them and this set is super easy and nice too."
"Love these. I like how itâ€™s easy to stack the weight and the bands are thick enough to not snap. Have lasted me over a year and are easy to store."
"This product is as seen in the photos and description. It includes 5 resistant bands from 10l. to 50lb weight. Hand and ankle staps. The door hook to rook resistant bands to door. A do not disturd sign and pamphlet of different exercises. And all of this fits into a bag. I've been using these for a week or so, and I have no complaints. The hooks are metal. I have no worry that they will snap."
"One of the clips already broken"
"The black starp is found broken into two pieces"
"I love the bands, I do get in a good workout in the mornings with them. Iâ€™m a few months Iâ€™ll order mens for more weight resistance."
"I’m sure there are a million products PTs use, but this is a super simple and very effective way to strength train your muscles after surgery (rotator cuff in my case).  Therband is the brand my office uses and the price was reasonable.  I use them twice daily right now and they’ve worked well.Not sure what folks are talking about when the mention an odd smell.  They smell like a giant rubber band sort of.  It isn’t offensive to me at all, but that’s subjective I suppose.  Durable so far and I can use them easily in multiple places such as at work.  Light weight and easily transported."
"Purchased for use during recovery from a total knee replacement after using them during physical therapy.  There are many different levels of resistance bands you can purchase and finding the right ones is quite important and this brand or level was just too strong for my needs.  However, I was very pleased with the quality of the product, its length and width, but it would be helpful if the product came with an illustrated workout guide.  On their Amazon site they do show at least three band exercises, but it would be much more useful if it was provided with this product.  Excellent pricing and would still recommend this product for anyone needing a higher resistance band."
"I got the non-latex beginner set.I like the versatility of the bands. There are Low impact. Many types exercises you can do with them.These bands work as expected and the quality is very good. No rubber smell.After a month of regular uses, the bands are still in great condition.I have not had any issue with bands snapping.A few comments about reviews bands breaking -The bands stretch up to a point.As you stretch the bands you can feel when you reach the limit.If that is not enough go to a higher resistance band.Just like a common rubber-band it will stretch until it snaps."
"When it comes to bands the Theraband style of band has been the most useful in our gym. They are easy to grab on to and adapt to both strength and mobility exercises. I know a lot of companies make bands in the same style, but I understand Theraband is the original and still the best.I most recently bought the latex band set that includes the blue and black bands. They are fairly low resistance on their own, so I usually use them together to get the right resistance. I particularly like them for band pull-aparts, face pulls, triceps pushdowns, abdominal work, and more. I much prefer these over tube style bands.Theraband has options for both latex and non-latex bands. I have both, but prefer latex bands, since it is a  natural material. Though in use, both work equally well. I've also found that both hold up well too, as I've not had any break on me, despite a lot of use.I do wish that the Advanced or Super Advanced sets included a Gold band (max resistance). As far as I can tell, it is only possible to get the Gold band by buying an entire 6-yard roll. Inclusion of a Gold (max) band would reduce the need for doubling-up bands to get more resistance.Other than the desire for a higher resistance band, I highly recommend these. As far as gym equipment goes, they are the best bang for the buck in terms of versatility."
"Long enough to use no matter what exercises my trainer comes up with. Very nice"
"I have done calisthenics and weight lifting. After a shoulder injury I couldn't continue my workouts the same way. Physical therapy let me keep some Therabands which I use for recovery of my shoulder. It was a different sensation to use bands as opposed to free weights. The time under tension is increased and your muscles will be challenged, but your joints will thank you afterwards. Bands let me train harder without having to worry about joint pain, as well as my strength and muscular endurance increasing greatly. Anyone tells you that bands are just for rehab have never tried them.I quickly progressed onto the black and silver bands and I've purchased various bands for specific muscle groups. The non latex Theraband typically lasts me 4-5 months before snapping. Something I realized recently was my anchor points possibly caused structural damage so they might last longer now that I've fixed that issue. I use them twice a week extensively.For $15 I'm more than willing to stick with these since trying other bands hasn't yielding much better.A gym membership or a single kettlebell costs more than these, so keep that in perspective.Resistance bands don't last forever, but your body will thank you in the long run."
"These are high quality bands for beginning resistance training. I like the 3 levels of resistance and their length is good for most resistance exercises."
"Bought these after my son had knee surgery for rehab. They work for basic rehab but not a lot of resistance as expected.  Good value for the money."
"I use these with my pilotes videos and I really feel the my muscles working."
"As a physio needing to rehab my own shoulder, the TheraBand Resistance Bands Set has been perfect for home use. The non-latex bands provide a smooth, controlled resistance ideal for strengthening without the need for weights. I love the variety of resistance levels, allowing me to gradually progress as my shoulder heals. They’re also incredibly versatile, useful for both upper and lower body exercises. The bands are lightweight, durable, and easy to store, making them convenient for at-home rehab or travel. Highly recommend for anyone looking for effective, space-saving exercise equipment!"
"Product met my expectations and continues to perform. Noticeable difference in resistance between thickness/colors. They also do not stick together like some brands."
"They are easy to use and there are so many ways to get a full body workout."
"These bands do a great job of using strength resistance. Look up exercises on YouTube and they’re easy to use."
"I love these to enhance my home work out"
"Work well while exercising"
"great workout bands, easy to use"
"Great easy way to meet your workout goals at home"
"they work"
"good exercise bands."
"Honestly purchased these accidentally as I thought the were circular bands not flat.  I was going to return them then saw the great quality and decided to keep and replace the cheaper set I already have."
"My others don't have padded handles, I'll look for that option when I purchase in the future."
"Use during exercise class and it works well."
"I am questioning purchasing these as they seem kind of cheap.  I wanted a handle like I use at exercise class but it isn’t confortable and doesn’t feel very sturdy.  I was planning to get another one but am now hesitant"
"Easy to use and fun to use."
"I use this item for my daily exercise and it helps to keep me in shape. The length and resistance is perfect for me and there are many exercises that can be done with it."
"Good quality. Strong."
"Service was great. Unfortunately, I ordered a new set from a different vendor. There was no flexibility in these so chose not to keep. It's not the strength as I do use pretty heavy ones, but these had no give at all."
"Effective exercise band for the money."
"No complaints about the product other than it is too short for my needs. I will need to return it. I tried to find a measurement given in the description but couldn't find it and so decided to take a chance. I would urge the company to clearly state the length of the cable in their description."
"This purchase was really just a try for my boyfriend who is working out at home rn. We weren't sure what to expect at first but they are the best thing I think I've ever bought for him. I love me a gift you can use. He uses these everyday along with a pull up bar and the results are great. The value of these are great for what you actually get which is a great workout. Very versatile and able to do several different workouts with it. Came with a very useful poster with even more exercises to do which is useful. Easy for men and women to use. Seem a little too easy for my boyfriend after he's been using them for a while but he uses them until he gets a good sweat going. We absolutely love them and will buy again. So far about 3 weeks in and still pretty durable. I would recommend this product for a easy but effective and cheap workout."
"The bands are easy to use and help me improve strength and posture In my neck and lower back and neck."
"It’s OK, but one of them snapped after a month, but it was fixable"
"I purchased this product years ago, it is incredible easy to bring with you anywhere, the bands have not broken or snapped but there has been some divots in high stress parts from use. The amount of bands you get is great and despite the weight not feeling as heavy as it represents, there is plenty of resistance and variety of exercises you can do with this kit to get a good workout. The size of all the bands is acceptable, but I’d recommend changing out the bag they give you for one of a bigger size  and more durable."
"Received my resistance band set today and used them to do a full body workout. I bought them specifically to use on my door that leads into my sunroom home gym. Great workout! Very strong and comfortable handles. Have purchased from Walito before so their quality was no surprise. Love the set and happy to incorporate these into my collection and workouts!"
"Works very well.  Good value for price"
"These resistance bands are very thick and high quality. They are heavy duty beyond any resistance bands I've ever had and facilitate a variety of strength-training workouts that target specific muscle groups and one's core in general. They can make it through carry-on airline travel and the TSA (at least one can space permitting)."
"When I read the 1 & 2 star ratings on these, I feel sorry for some of those who were injured, but I also note several hints that some of these folks were using these items far beyond their intended potential.These aren't designed to lift both hands over your head.  That's just asking for trouble.  If you use the door attachment, make sure it's firmly seated and that the door edge doesn't have too wide a gap in it.  Examine your equipment each time before use.  Use them modestly; they are not intended for extreme exercise.  (If you need that, spend four times the money and get a high-quality pro system.)  You can't pay twenty bucks for exercise equipment and expect $150 quality, right?As far as the set itself goes, I had it unpackaged and was using it within 5 minutes.  It was easy and intuitive to assemble.  The lighter bands allowed a wide range of movement, while the heavy 50 lb band (normally out of my strength range) provided shorter-range power exercises. They were all valuable in one exercise or another.My only complaint was the width of the handles; too narrow.  The straps kept rubbing on my hands, warranting exercise gloves (and I have narrow hands).  That's a rather severe design issue... enough to drop this from 5 stars to 3.  The handles surely should have been wider.  Men with wider hands could not use these.Beyond that, the set works well, and for 20 bucks I couldn't really expect more."
"Excellent quality and comfort. I was searching for new bands. The details with the product for example, adding the weight of each band is great! The handles are soft and comfortable. The package is thoughtful with the signage to place on the door handle and the ball for massage. Great job"
"The resistance that in way matches the weight.  But use the door hook for other bands. Not a total lost"
"Great option for working out at home! Diverse resistances can combine into 10 strengths for deep activate of muscle tissues. You can also have several different ways to use them due to moderate length."
"They appear to be a very good set of resistance bands. They have metal carabiners to connect the bands to the grip handles. When I first started using them, I couldn't help but feel apprehensive about whether or not the bands would suddenly snap or if the metal pieces would come undone and fling the hard metal at my face/feet. Hopefully they won't break or snap while being used."
"Does what it’s supposed to good value"
"I've done resistance training in the past with tubing and handles. While I think they're an extremely good mode of working out, I found the clips, handles, etc, fairly clumsy and ""fiddly"" when trying to just move through a fluid, effective, and efficient workout. Also, using handles make it hard to avoid a ""dead"" space where they join the clips and tubes.I find the resistance bands so much more compact, efficient, also easy to travel with.  The workout flows much more smoothly without trying to quickly change handles, clips, etc; with tubing I found myself taking unwanted ""breaks"", which was frustrating because they break the rhythm, the breathing, the flow, even the meditative quality working with resistance tubing or bands can offer. The bands function much more smoothly and lend themselves to good ""flow"" and mindfulness even while doing challenging strength training. I find the bands much more enjoyable and conducive to focus and centering than the hardware-laden tubing.The UnderSun bands are an excellent quality. Careful inspection of each band revealed no defects or irregularities i workmanship, and the material looks very durable. I believe if conscientiously cared for, they will last a good number of years, relative to how often and how stringently they are used, I'm sure. But they seem truly excellent.Finally, UnderSun customer service is stellar. My bands arrived very quickly, I received a friendly follow-up email, and offer of any assistance needed. I purchased a bundle which included a training package, and access to a closed facebook group. This group is very friendly and supportive, and the company is extremely helpful and supportive as well via email. They are just a really good group of people who seem to really care about others' wellbeing and fitness, as well as striving to operate an excellent, American business.I am a 66-year-old female with no affiliation to UnderSun, and I bought my bundle with my own money. My highly positive, 5-star review is solely based on my opinion and experience. UnderSun folks deserve every star and more."
"First I want to say that I am busy and usually don't spend time writing reviews...but if you are like me and considering the Undersun bands I wanted you to read this.  I thought about wether I wanted to try these or not because I am used to weights and for cardio I cycle.  I was a little skeptical but did my research and found the videos by Undesun very intriguing...With the gyms closed and the price of buying a weight set and dumbbells through the roof I thought I would give these a try. Being a little creative you can hit all body parts with the Undersun 5 Band kit. It also comes with a thing to hook behind a door which opens up even more exercises. Plus I use them with a  bench for more variety. You can really copy all your fav muscle building exercises and get a really good pump if your doing things right. Also you can do a work out in such a way that you will be killing it on cardio at the same time. Yes its a bit different but at the end of the day its resistance training and I have great workouts. With the 5 bands there is no shortage of resistance (weight) that you can create in an almost endless variety of exercises for every body part. So if your some huge guy no problem...I dare you to not have enough resistance! And if your a petite 98 pound gal the lighter bands are perfect. If your a little savy you will figure out that by simply changing your grip, stance and or amount you choke up on the band you are using will totally change its resistance level and act like multiple bands all in the same band...plus there are 5 in total all different levels of resistance.  Like I say, be creative, watch the videos they offer, and save your self some money on stacking up on weights in your garage and get a set of these. They store in a small bag that comes with the set which keeps things tidy. Once the gym opens for sure I will be back but I will still use these plenty because its just so convenient to get a great work out in. Hope this helps you make a decision."
"These bands just arrived today so I haven't actually had the chance to do a real workout with them. So I can't really speak to their durability, but I did a few test exercises and used the door anchor and everything so far seems very high quality and meets if not exceeds my expectations. Bands definitely do not feel cheap or flimsy.Update: Now that I've done an actual workout with them (only one so far) I can say that they do hold up. I put lots of stretch tension on these things and they did not snap. I don't notice any warping or damage or even minor tears. As soon as the tension is released, they return to their original condition without any sign of being stretched out, as if they were never used.Door anchor held up perfectly as well. The outdoor strap or comes with is cool added functionality, but it would be nice if it came with its own velcro or other mechanism for keeping it out of the way when not in use. I just rolled it up into a ball and used some of the rubber bands that came with the packaging to hold it in place and that seems to work perfectly.There does seem to be a learning curve coming to these bands from free weights and cable machines. I think mastering proper technique to get equivalent muscle activation will take some practice. The inverted strength curve of the bands compared to free weights and cable machines makes it harder for me to correctly judge how close or far I am from fatigue and failure and will take some getting used to.I am undecided on whether I would switch entirely to resistance bands with my current muscle building goals. I definitely look forward to at least incorporating them as a rotating part of my workout though. And there's no question that their portability makes for an excellent and convenient workout option for travel."
"I've used a couple of bands from amazon, and they all stretch or break eventually. This is the only one so far in the last year which has held up and remained firm"
"I recently purchased this set of three exercise bands, and they have exceeded my expectations. The colors are vibrant and stylish, adding a nice touch to my workouts. Each band offers a different level of resistance, which is perfect for gradually increasing the intensity of my exercises.The quality of the bands is impressive‚Äîthey feel strong and durable, providing consistent resistance without stretching out or losing elasticity. They offer just the right amount of challenge for various exercises, from strength training to stretching.What I love most is how comfortable they are to use. The material is soft and doesn‚Äôt dig into my skin, even during extended workout sessions. They also stay in place really well, so I don‚Äôt have to constantly readjust them."
"I love the material of these bands. They make working out enjoyable. The only thing that I wish it has was more bands in the set! The ones that come in this set were great and great quality. Would highly recommend"
"This is not your typical flimsy and weak plastic band. This is high quality thick fabric band that doesn‚Äôt roll up or break. Amazing for those who have thicker thighs and suffer from plastic bands rolling up and digging in your legs. Highly recommended."
"Variable and stable resistance. Easy to use. No breakage like to pt ones you get. Doesn't roll up, very comfortable.on skin, performs as it should. Makes working out easier and me.more inclined to do it."
"Great quality and the cloth covers are comfortable. The resistance level are a plus & ideal for home PT strengthening.Included is a travel/storage bag and a pamphlet of exercise ideas. I'm ordering more as gifts and for traveling."
"The package contains three bands of different resistances and an instruction sheet for some exercises.  I have found them to be sturdy and comfortable and the exercises to be helpful."
"These are so much nicer than I was expecting and the quality is superior. A perfect set for home use and already feeling it in my muscles."
"Great product. They stay put/dont slide around like the silicone bands do. Love them!"
"They are so comfortable and ease to use! Highly recommended."
"I ordered the green/pink/purple set and they came exactly as pictured, each band in its own ziplock bag, and all 3 within the handy black mesh bag, along with a little pamphlet showing some exercises.  Sewn on the inside of each band is a little black tag that tells you the strength of the band--light, medium, and heavy.  The lightest band is just a little bit stronger than using a set of 3 rubber strength bands all at the same time.  I wish the heaviest band was just a little bit stronger, which is why I would recommend this set for intermediate level exercisers.  For reference, I am 5' 2.5"" tall, 102 pounds, and on the recumbent  leg press, I push 205 pounds for 3 sets of 10 reps.  In comparison, I've tried a set of fabric bands by Northern Lights, which is sold through Fitness Depot in Canada, and those bands are so much harder, I can barely stretch the heaviest band by more than a centimetre.  These bands by Coobons allow me a much greater range of motion.  I was afraid there would be a strong chemical smell, but these bands have only the faintest odour of rubber, and I had to hold them right up to my nose and take a deep whiff to detect it.  Overall, I am very pleased with the quality and attractive colours!  Highly recommended!"
"misleading info about product."
"I do wish there were better ways of attaching these things, but they do include several ways, and the useful exercise that you can get for such a small price is insane, and they're super light and packable if you need to take them anywhere. I just use the black one, I can't remember the resistance rating, maybe 10 or 15 lbs. I'm about 160, Male, often considered fairly strong for my size, but this band feels plenty sturdy enough for me to get good exercise, especially when I stretch it out far and go for high reps. You can move faster with bands than with weights, which is a  interesting advantage. You can really rack up the reps fast. I can't imagine starting on any fitness journey without such a useful tool at the center of your regiment."
"Great product, easy to use and to setup. I keep them in my daily workout routine. They have different weights per color"
"If you have a shoulder injury specifically a rotator cuff injury and you are having a hard time with this problem because of the pain and I've had this problem before and the best exercise for me was using resistance bands. If you want to use it for something like that then this is the best product just in speaking about resistance bands in general to help you with that the thing is if you're expecting to do like serious exercising with like a very high quality thick rubber band or resistance band this is more or less like on the basic standard quality it's not they're not heavy duty like professional quality but that doesn't mean that it wasn't a good product overall and it did deliver on what it's supposed to do and for the price that I paid for him I do recommend these for You especially if you're on a budget"
"Good for working out."
"Nice quality stretch bands. Like that they have handles that attach"
"After using these products continuously for a few months to start me off until I could get my hands on some more heavy duty equipment these were good but the resistance offered didn’t seem to hold as I would have to quickly graduate to the next one just to feel some tension that made the workout feel like a workout"
"Good set and seems identical to most but eith a lower cost."
"I use it daily. Like it."
"We use this product only one time and one minute.Product quality is very low. Also we found its damage itself. Cheap products and very poor quality. Do not purchase."
